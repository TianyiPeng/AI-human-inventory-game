Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (231, 255, 302, 272, 272) shows a mean of approximately 266 units/period with a standard deviation of 26 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which implies same-period arrival for orders placed now. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most relevant demand profile, and set L to 'default' (0) to match the promised lead time. This will allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a single period (1+L=1) and attempt to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is women's fine-knit trainer socks. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and Period 1's arrival confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (ordered 289, arrived 289 same period). Historical demand shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] from the seed data and a current demand of 287 in Period 1. The average of these 6 samples is 269.8. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current steady demand level while maintaining a buffer. Since L=0 is confirmed, I will use the 'default' lead time method.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', and the current date is late February, entering the Spring season. Historically, the last 7 periods of demand are [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287, 548]. There is a massive demand spike in Period 2 (548 units), which is essentially double the previous mean. I suspect the start of warmer weather or a promotional event for trainer socks. Promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0 in Period 1 and 2. I need to react quickly to this demand surge to avoid stockouts, as Period 2 ended with 0 inventory and lost sales (demand 548 vs sold 291). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent jump heavily while acknowledging the prior stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 2: demand surged from a mean of ~270 to 548 (+100%). Likely seasonal transition for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1495.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has experienced a significant demand shift. Historical demand for the first period was ~280, followed by a surge to 548 in Period 2 and 399 in Period 3. This indicates a seasonal transition as we enter March, likely driven by warmer weather. The mean demand for the last two periods (Regime 2) is 473.5. Current on-hand inventory is low (101 units) and promised lead time is 0, which has been consistent (L=0). To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat based on the recent N=2 periods to capture the higher demand regime, while choosing Recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for P2-P3 is ~474, significantly higher than P1 (~287). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1127.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see a demand surge in early spring (March) due to changing footwear habits. Historical demand confirms a regime shift: P1 was ~287, but the mean for P2-P4 is ~428. While P4 demand dropped to 338, it is still higher than P1. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Based on the seasonal context (March 11th) and the shift observed since mid-February, I am modeling demand using the most recent 3 periods (P2-P4) to capture this higher-demand regime while accounting for the lower P4 value. This provides a mu_hat of ~428 and maintains a safety buffer for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $740.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see a demand surge in early spring as weather warms up. We observed a significant peak in Period 2 (demand=548) and Period 3 (demand=399), but the last two periods (P4 and P5) show a cooldown with demands of 338 and 252 respectively. The current date is March 18, 2019. The mean demand of the last 4 periods (P2-P5) is 384.25, while the mean of the last 2 periods is 295. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the potential for spring demand to be plateaus or spikes rather than a steady decline, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the elevated post-winter regime while acknowledging the recent dip. This balances the risk of another spike against the current downward trend. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for P2-P5 is ~384, showing high volatility (range 252-548). Seasonality for trainer socks remains active but volatile.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens' trainer socks) is currently in a spring seasonal demand regime. Date is March 25th. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) has stabilized at a mean of ~373 units (548, 399, 338, 252, 329), which is significantly higher than the P1 demand of 287. Although Period 5 dipped to 252, demand rebounded to 329 in Period 6. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed by history. I will focus the OR backend on the recent regime (N=5) to capture this higher seasonal mean and higher standard deviation (std ~112). This will set a base stock level that prevents the stockouts seen in Period 2 while managing holding costs as inventory is currently at 161.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a spring seasonal regime (April 1st). Since Period 2, we have observed a mean demand of approximately 380 units per period (Demands: 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415), which is significantly higher and more volatile than the initial Period 1 demand. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this higher-demand regime and the transition into spring, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the statistics of the period since the initial surge. With a service level (q) of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), the OR backend should maintain high availability while remaining responsive to the current volatility (Std Dev approx 95).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in its peak spring season (April). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the regime shift in Period 2, demand has fluctuated but maintained a higher mean compared to the start of the year. The most recent demand samples from P4-P8 (338, 252, 329, 415, 382) show a mean of 343.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 62. Given the seasonal relevance of trainer socks in April, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this current stabilization while remaining responsive to the current trend. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (P4-P8) provides a balanced forecast for the OR backend, ensuring high service levels during the active spring period while accounting for observed volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a spring seasonal regime (mid-April). Historical demand from Period 6 to Period 9 shows relative stability compared to the initial surge in February, with demands of 329, 415, 382, and 322. The mean demand over these last 4 periods is approximately 362. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with arrivals concluding in the same period they are ordered. Given the seasonal nature of trainer socks as we approach late spring/summer, I will focus on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mean and volatility, while maintaining a lead time value of 0. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current demand level plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility, ensuring we minimize holding costs while capturing the $4.0 profit per unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-initial surge: Period 6-9 mean demand is 362 (down from earlier peaks but higher than start-of-season P1). Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is shaftless cotton-blend trainer socks, which fits the spring/summer seasonal profile. Since the initial demand surge in February/March (Period 2-3), the demand has stabilized around a new mean. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10), the average demand is (329+415+382+322+308)/5 = 351.2, with a standard deviation of approximately 45. This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' that demand is staying significantly higher than the initial Period 1 level (287). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized seasonal regime while maintaining responsiveness to recent fluctuations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~351 units plus a safety buffer based on recent volatility, effectively balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering late April/early May, a period associated with increasing seasonal demand as temperatures rise. Historical demand shows a significant surge starting Period 2, with a recent mean (Period 6-11) of approximately 347 units. Period 11 experienced a stockout (demand 427, sold 390), indicating that current inventory levels are insufficient for demand spikes. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am using a recent window (N=6) to capture the current demand level (mean ~347) while ensuring the sigma reflects the high volatility (standard deviation ~54) observed in this period. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer based on a 0.8 service level (4/(4+1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late April: Period 11 saw a demand spike of 427 (+38% over P10), leading to a stockout. Mean demand for P6-P11 is 347.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that typically sees peak demand in late spring and summer as weather warms. Recent history (Period 11: 427, Period 12: 438) confirms a significant demand upswing compared to the earlier regime (P6-P10 mean: 331). We have experienced two consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0), indicating that the current inventory targets are insufficient for this seasonal acceleration. Lead time is confirmed as 0. To capture this shift and ensure high service levels during the seasonal peak, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for demand and volatility to prioritize recent higher observations (mean ~387) over early-season data, preventing further lost sales while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Late spring peak demand observed (P11-P12 mean ~433, +30% vs P1-P10 mean of ~330). Seasonal peak for trainer socks confirmed for May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historical demand for these 'fine-knit trainer socks' shows high volatility with recent peaks in late April/early May (P11: 427, P12: 438) followed by a sharp drop in P13 (267). This drop may be a noise fluctuation or a temporary cooling post-peak, but demand remains significantly higher than the February baseline (P1: 287). The current on-hand inventory is 159 units. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility and the seasonal relevance of trainer socks in May, I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture the late-season mean (mean of P11-P13 is ~377) and standard deviation. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 allows the OR engine to respond to the recent demand levels while acknowledging the high sigma from the recent 400+ units spikes, ensuring we maintain safety stock against another potential May surge before the season ends.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-late May (2019/05/20). The item is shaftless trainer socks, which are highly seasonal. A demand surge was observed in Period 11 and 12 (demands of 427 and 438), but the last two periods (P13-P14) have seen a cool-down to 267 and 275 units. This suggests either a volatility spike or a passing of the peak spring surge. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the early May peak while accounting for continued seasonality, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility, focusing on the last 4 periods (P11-P14) to capture the shift from the peak back to moderate levels. On-hand inventory is 183. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods, which is 1 period here.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (trainer socks) is in its peak seasonal window (late May). Analysis of the last 5 periods (P11-P15) shows a mean demand of 351, which includes a high peak (438) followed by a cooling period and a subsequent recovery in P15 (348). This suggests a stabilized high-demand regime compared to the pre-season mean of 266. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since lead time is 0, the OR backend must cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current seasonal volatility and average demand levels, ensuring the base stock level targets the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/($4+$1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May: P11-P15 mean demand is 351, showing a peak-and-plateau pattern typical for late spring trainer sock sales. Initial spring surge (P2-P3) has settled into a sustained higher baseline vs initial levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3rd), we are entering the peak summer season for trainer socks. Historical game data shows a demand regime that settled into a higher baseline since Period 11, with the most recent two periods (P15-P16) showing an upward trend (348 and 370 units). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game history. To capture the current early-summer demand level, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 (covering Periods 11-16), which yields a mean demand of approximately 354. This timeframe captures the transition from late spring into summer. Given the high volatility observed (std dev is significant), the OR backend's service level calculation based on the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio\u2014resulting in a roughly 80% critical fractile\u2014will naturally maintain a safety stock to protect against the frequent demand spikes seen in previous months (e.g., P11-P12).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during spring and early summer. Looking at recent performance, Period 11 to 17 shows a mean demand of approximately 346 units (427, 438, 267, 275, 348, 370, 297). While there was a significant surge in late April (Periods 11-12), the demand has since stabilized into a range of 270-370. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock policy (L+1) effectively only needs to cover the demand for the current period. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) results in a target service level of 0.80. To balance the risk of stockouts during the summer season against holding costs, I will use a recent window (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current post-peak stability, while ensuring the model remains responsive to the higher baseline established after the spring surge.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P13-P18) shows a stabilization following the late spring peaks. The mean demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 308 (267, 275, 348, 370, 297, 294), which is lower than the early May surge but remains significantly higher than the initial baseline. As we are now in mid-June (2019/6/17), demand for 'fine-knit trainer socks' is expected to remain consistent with summer patterns. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' plateau while maintaining enough responsiveness for the current summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized from P13-P18 (mean ~308), marking the transition from the late spring surge to a consistent summer plateau.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its summer plateau phase. Over the last 7 periods (P13-P19), demand has stabilized significantly with a mean of approximately 298 and lower volatility compared to the spring peaks. Specifically, demand values were [267, 275, 348, 370, 297, 294, 334]. The most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) show very consistent demand (mean 308, std ~22). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this summer plateau regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), which effectively covers the transition into the current stable state. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes holding costs while maintaining enough safety stock for the minor fluctuations observed in June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has shown a strong seasonal demand since Period 2 (February). Historical demand has settled into a summer plateau from Period 13 onwards (May-June). The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P13-P20) is approximately 313. Despite high volatility, there is no evidence of a new regime shift or holiday spike approaching in early July (Period 21). Lead time has consistently remained at 0, which is the promised lead time. I will set L to 'default' and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the current summer plateau regime) to allow the OR engine to capture the recent mean and variance accurately for the current summer environment.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable summer plateau. Demand observation from P13 to P21 shows a mean of approximately 305 units (305.1), with demand in the most recent periods (P18-P21) being 294, 334, 289, and 317. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since the transition to this summer plateau (starting around P13). This N=9 window balances the early-summer peak (P15-P16) with the current July levels. The OR backend will use these values to target a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)). Since lead time is zero, base stock targets 1 period of demand (L+1=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1225.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and stabilization in summer. Historical data shows demand stabilized significantly between Periods 13 and 22. In the last 10 periods (P13-P22), demand has averaged 310.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 33 units. This represents a consistent summer plateau. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. For Period 23 (mid-July), there are no major holidays or seasonal shifts expected to disrupt this plateau. I am using a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture this stabilized summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it accurately reflects the current demand level and volatility while filtering out the more volatile spring transition peaks. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock for the current variance, minimizing holding costs while preventing stockouts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is trainer socks, which are highly seasonal. We are currently in late July (2019/7/22). Since Period 19, the demand has entered a stable summer plateau. Looking at the demand from Period 19 to 23: [334, 289, 317, 313, 352], the mean is approximately 321. Period 23 saw a demand of 352, which led to a minor stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this summer plateau and the slight volatility that caused the recent stockout, I will use a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx 321) and standard deviation (approx 23). This provides the OR backend with the most relevant data for the current summer demand pattern.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in late July (Period 25). Demand has stabilized into a consistent summer plateau. From Period 19 to Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 313.6 units per period (334, 289, 317, 313, 352, 277). This is very stable compared to the spring volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. For the OR backend, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture this stable summer plateau for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime and avoids the noise from the earlier spring peaks. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the backend will target an 80th percentile service level.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau confirmed (P19-P24): Mean demand holds steady at ~314 units with low volatility compared to spring.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable summer demand plateau. Over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), demand has averaged 305 units with relatively low volatility compared to the spring surge. The most recent demand (256 in P25) is slightly lower than the recent average, but consistent with a stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer baseline (N=7 covers the period from P19 up to the latest observation). The backend OR will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 0-period lead time and the high critical ratio (Profit: $4, Holding: $1), ensuring high service levels during this period of steady demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable summer demand plateau. From Period 19 to Period 26, the demand has averaged approximately 300 units with moderate volatility. Specifically, the last four periods (P23-P26) have shown demands of 352, 277, 256, and 258, indicating a slight downward trend or stabilization at a lower level (~285 units) compared to the mid-summer peak. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high criticality (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), maintaining a robust service level is important, but we must also avoid overstocking as we approach the end of the summer season. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current summer regime's mean and standard deviation, which provides a stable baseline for the OR backend's safety stock calculation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. We are in a stable 'summer plateau' demand regime for trainer socks, which has persisted since Period 19. Over the last 9 periods (P19-P27), the mean demand is approximately 299.6 units, compared to the earlier spring peaks. Relative volatility is low. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. For Period 28, I will use a recent_N window of 9 to capture this summer plateau mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This period window aligns with the transition identified in the carry-over insights starting at Period 19. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers the expected demand and safety stock for this stabilized summer period, while adjusting for the current 29 units on-hand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in a stable 'summer plateau' phase for trainer socks, which has persisted since Period 19. Demand for the last 10 periods (P19-P28) has an average of 299.8 units with relatively low volatility compared to the spring peaks. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, with every order from P1 to P28 arriving in the same period it was placed. Given this consistency, I will set L to 'default' (0) and use a 'recent_N' window of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable plateau while filtering out the volatile spring data. This window adequately covers the detected regime shift starting around Period 19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for trainer socks (372860001) has transitioned from the late spring/early summer peaks into a stable late-summer plateau. Over the last 6 periods (P24-P29), the mean demand has been approximately 269 units, which is notably lower than the previous July plateau of 314. The last period (P29) saw a drop to 229, potentially signaling the start of a post-summer decline. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the steady decline in both mean and volatility [277, 256, 258, 301, 294, 229], I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current late-summer regime. This will prevent over-ordering as we move further into September, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost by focusing on the most recent consumption behavior.

Carry-over insight: September transition: Demand mean shifted from ~314 (P19-P24) to ~269 (P24-P29), a 14% decrease marking the end of the peak trainer sock season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a seasonal transition from the summer peak to a lower autumn demand regime. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) shows values of [256, 258, 301, 294, 229, 274], with a mean of ~268 unit. This is a noticeable drop from the summer plateau (~314). Given the current date is September 9th, demand is expected to remain at this lower level or continue to trend slightly downwards as the 'trainer sock' season ends. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this recent downward shift in demand volume and volatility while maintaining a safe stock level to cover the (L+1) period (where L=0, so 1 period of demand).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (mid-September). Demand history confirms a transition from the peak summer plateau (mean ~314) to a lower autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has averaged approximately 266 units (samples: 256, 258, 301, 294, 229, 274, 254). This aligns with the seasonal nature of 'trainer socks', which typically see a decline as weather cools. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition accurately while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This will prevent overstocking as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P25-P31 is 266, down from the summer peak of 314 (-15%), reflecting seasonal cooling.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an autumn demand regime. After a peak summer plateau (P19-P24 mean ~314), demand shifted downward around Period 25. The mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 264 units (demands: 256, 258, 301, 294, 229, 274, 254, 248). This confirms the stabilizing autumn trend previously identified. The lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this current regime while excluding the higher summer volumes. This will help the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio without overstocking as seasonality cools further.

In Period 33, demand spiked unexpectedly to 405 units (Date: 2019/9/23), which is a significant deviation (+52%) from the established autumn mean of ~266. This may be a 'last hurrah' for trainer socks or a temporary outlier. Given the stockout in Period 33, I must ensure the inventory is replenished to capture sustained demand while noting that we are deep into the off-season for shaftless socks. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent spike heavily enough to avoid further stockouts, while acknowledging the generally lower seasonal trend. Lead time remains stable at 0. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand and the recent increase in volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is fine-knit trainer socks, which follows a seasonal pattern. We are currently in early October (Period 35). Demand for 'trainer socks' typically decreases as the weather cools in autumn. In Period 33, there was a significant demand spike (405), which caused a stockout, but Period 34 returned to a more moderate level (312). Assessing the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the mean demand is 298.6 compared to the previous autumn mean of 266, suggesting a slightly higher baseline than initially expected for this transition period or higher volatility. Given the product type and the date (October), I anticipate a general downward trend for the remainder of the year. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the slightly higher recent demand, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the recent spike without overreacting to it as if it were a permanent upward shift. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Post-summer demand stabilized. Recent volatility (P33 spike of 405) suggests that while general trend is downward for autumn, individual period variants remain significant. P30-P34 mean is ~299.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in an autumn cooling phase (P36: Oct 14). While Period 33 saw a significant outlier (405 units), the most recent demand (P35) was 266, which aligns with the post-summer plateau average. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is approximately 293 units. Given the transition into late October, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly decrease further as seasonal trainer sock usage drops for winter. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the post-summer shift and the recent volatility spike while maintaining a safer base stock for the current period's on-hand of 87.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in Oct 2019, transitioning late into the autumn season. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high peak in spring (May), a consistent plateau in summer, and a gradual decline starting in September. The mean demand for the summer plateau (P19-P24) was ~314, which dropped to ~269 (P24-P29). Recently (P30-P36), the mean has fluctuated but remains lower (mean ~285), though individual spikes like P33 (405 units) require maintaining a safety buffer. Given lead time is consistently 0, the focus is on capturing the current declining trend while protecting against residual volatility. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the most recent post-September regime (P30-P36), which reflects the current late-autumn baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the autumn season for trainer socks, which typically sees lower demand than the spring/summer peaks but still experiences occasional volatility. Recent demand for Periods 30-37 has been [274, 254, 248, 405, 312, 266, 240, 306], resulting in a mean of approximately 288 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game history. Because of the recent fluctuations (varying between 240 and 405) and the 1:4 holding-to-profit ratio (suggesting a desire for a relatively high service level), I will use the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current autumn demand regime and its volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This period count covers the shift that started around Period 30. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Period 30-37 mean demand is 288. While lower than the summer plateau (~314), high single-period volatility (max 405) persists in late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-winter season for trainer socks. Historically, demand for trainer socks peaks in spring/summer and decreases in autumn. For Period 30-38, the mean demand is approximately 283 units. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has been 312, 266, 240, 306, 276, averaging 280 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the consistent lead time of 0, our primary goal is to set parameters that cover the single-period demand (review + lead time = 1 period). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (covering roughly P29-P38) which aligns with the autumn regime mean of ~281. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 10 to capture recent volatility, accounting for occasional spikes like the 306 in Period 37.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the late autumn regime for '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical data shows that demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the summer peak. The mean demand from Period 30 to Period 39 is approximately 283 units. Recent demand (P35-P39) has been even lower, averaging 266 units. Given the transition into late Q4, there is no immediate expectation of a spike before the holiday season (trainer socks tend to be more summer-seasonal). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the autumn baseline (mean ~283) while allowing for the high single-period volatility observed in this SKU (sigma_hat recent_N=10). This maintains a responsive base-stock level while minimizing holding costs for a product that is past its peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition confirmed: P30-P39 mean demand is 283 units, down from summer plateau of 314 (-10%). Lead time remains 0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn/early winter regime for trainer socks. Demand has stabilized into a lower baseline compared to the summer. The mean demand from Period 30 to Period 40 is approximately 279 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory starts at 73 units on-hand. Since the product is 'trainer socks', we expect demand to remain steady or slightly decrease further as winter approaches, but without any evidence of a sharp drop yet, I will use a recent_N window that captures this autumn stabilization. Using N=11 (from Period 30 onwards) provides a mean of ~279 and captures the relevant volatility (including the Period 33 spike), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this period's demand occurring after the order arrival.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late November (P42, 2019/11/25), heading into the winter season for 'fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical data shows demand has cooled from the summer peak (~314) and the early autumn regime (~283). Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been [306, 276, 241, 252, 210], showing a clear downward trend with a mean of 257. The most recent demand (210) is the lowest in several periods, confirming the seasonal slowdown as consumers likely pivot towards thermal or thicker socks. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this decelerating demand while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the volatility (standard deviation remains significant in this category). The base_stock calculation will naturally lower the order quantity to avoid excess inventory and holding costs during this low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal decline confirmed: Mean demand from P37-P41 dropped to 257, with the most recent Period 41 reaching 210. This marks a ~10% reduction from the autumn baseline (283).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 was 354, a sharp and unexpected spike compared to the recent winter decline (Period 41 demand was 210, and the P37-P41 mean was 257). This spike occurred in late November (2019/11/25), likely influenced by Black Friday / Cyber Monday promotional events which historically drive high demand for apparel basics like trainer socks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. With lead time consistently confirmed at 0, I must ensure current period demand (Period 43, early December) is fully covered. Given the volatility (spike in P42 vs decline in P41), I will use an EWMA with a higher gamma (0.7) to heavily weight the most recent peak while acknowledging the overall winter downward trend. Lead time will remain at 'default' (0). Sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to capture this increased volatility without over-penalizing for the much higher spring/summer variances.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility detected: Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (354) likely due to late-November retail events, temporarily reversing the winter decline observed in P41.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak of the holiday shopping season. Recent demand has been volatile: Period 42 showed a spike (354) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, while Period 43 dropped significantly to 143. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the date, another spike is likely before Christmas, followed by a post-holiday dip. The current on-hand inventory is 183. To account for holiday volatility while recognizing the general winter downtrend, I am using a recent search of 5 periods (P39-P43) which captures the high-demand P42 and the low-demand P43, resulting in a mean of ~240. I will keep sigma_hat at recent_N=5 to cover the high variance observed (std dev ~70), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer for potential pre-Christmas surges.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility confirmed: Significant demand swing observed between P42 (354) and P43 (143), reflecting retail event timing rather than a sustained trend shift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a winter demand regime. Recent demand has been highly volatile due to late-November holiday retail events (P42: 354, P43: 143, P44: 209). As of Period 45 (mid-December), we expect demand to stabilize at a lower winter baseline before any pre-Christmas or end-of-year clearance surges. Lead time is consistently 0. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 233.6, which captures both the holiday spike and the subsequent correction. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this late-year volatility while maintaining a baseline sufficient for the 80% service level target (implied by Profit $4 / Holding $1).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), two days before Christmas. Historical demand for these trainer socks shows a significant spike in late November (P42 demand: 354), followed by a notable slump in early December (P43 demand: 143), and a slight recovery in the last two weeks (P44: 209, P45: 231). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 229, which aligns with the winter baseline observed before the holiday noise. Given the product category (fine-knit trainer socks), we do not expect a massive post-Christmas surge, but rather a continuation of the stable winter baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (229 units) to filter out the high-volatility holiday swings and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent variance caused by those swings, ensuring the backend maintains an appropriate safety stock for potential end-of-year replenishment demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline demand (P41-P45) is approximately 229 units, successfully filtering out high-volatility holiday spikes/slumps.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 47 (December 30, 2019), representing the final week of the year and the tail end of the winter season. Historical data shows that trainer socks (a summer-leaning item) have entered a lower-demand winter regime. Mean demand from Period 41 to 46 (excluding the holiday-driven outlier in Period 42) is approximately 224 units. Most recently, Period 46 saw demand of 224 units, and Period 45 was 231. Given the post-holiday timing, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease before the spring transition. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To accurately capture the current winter baseline while filtering out November/December retail spikes, I am using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent consistent demand behavior (P41-P46) which aligns with the winter trend identified in carry-over insights.
