Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a stable basic item. Initial historical demand samples [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] show a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of 26.3. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no specific calendar events or observed lead-time shifts yet, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level. The profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0) suggests a critical ratio of 0.8, which the OR backend will use to determine the base stock. With a lead time of 0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period (1+0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product (Women's trainer socks) and the date, we are in a stable demand period ahead of spring. In Period 1, we ordered 289 units, which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods works as expected. The demand in Period 1 was 287, leaving 2 units on-hand. The historical demand data provided [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] plus Period 1's 287 shows a fairly stable pattern with a mean around 270. Since the history is short (6 samples total), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent volatility/mean while excluding the oldest outlier if one exists. This will help the the OR backend set a base stock that covers the lead time (0) plus the current period (L+1=1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a stable basic item. In Period 2 (Feb 18), we observed a significant demand spike to 548 units, compared to the historical average (approx. 267) and Period 1 (287). This spike likely corresponds to a payday or seasonal transition period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, due to the high demand in P2, the ending inventory dropped to 0, resulting in lost sales (255 units). To recover and prevent further stockouts while accounting for this potential new demand level, I will use recent history (N=2, the current period's context and the previous) to estimate mean demand. This prevents the OR engine from being anchored too heavily by the older, lower demand figures (231-272) while acknowledging the high volatility seen in the last period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1495.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks in a soft cotton blend' (Womens), which typically enters higher demand as spring approaches (March). Observed demand over the first three periods has been higher than the historical mean provided (Avg of [287, 548, 399] = 411 vs historical [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] = 266). Notably, Period 2 saw a demand spike to 548, causing a stockout. The promised lead time of 0 periods is currently being met consistently. Given the volatility (std dev of recent demand is high) and the transition into spring seasonality, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and volatility while maintaining the lead time at 0.

Carry-over insight: Current three-period demand (avg 411) significantly exceeds historical mean (avg 266), likely reflecting early spring seasonality for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is experiencing a sustained increase in demand as we move into March, likely driven by spring seasonality. The last three periods show demands of 548, 399, and 338 (average 428), compared to the pre-game historical average of 266 and Period 1's 287. Although Period 4's demand (338) was lower than Period 3 (399), it remains significantly above historical norms. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0 observed in all 4 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in this performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this higher-demand spring regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in Period 2. The OR backend will use these values to target a service level of 80% (z=0.84) based on the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 2-4 average demand (428) is ~60% higher than historical mean (266), correlating with spring seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal increase in demand during spring (March/April). Current demand history shows a spike starting Period 2 (548, 399, 338, 252). While the Period 5 demand dropped to 252 (bringing the 4-period mean down to 384), the overall trend since mid-February is significantly higher than the initial historical mean (266). Given the date (March 18), we are in the peak period for trainer socks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for both mean and variance while smoothing out the single low observation from Period 5. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by all past arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal increase as spring approaches in late March. Historical data shows a shift around Period 2. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P2-P6), the mean demand is 373.2 compared to the pre-game mean of 266. Although P5 and P6 showed slightly lower demand (252 and 329), the seasonal context (late March) and the earlier spike to 548 suggest we should maintain a robust stock level. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variability spring demand regime, ensuring the base stock level can handle the potential 400+ unit spikes seen recently.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is displaying seasonal demand growth as we enter April. Historical demand shows a baseline around 266 units, but the mean for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) has risen to 346.6 units, with a notable peak of 415 in the most recent period (P7). Given the context of 'Socks & Tights' and 'trainer socks' transitioning from winter into spring (April 1st), the demand regime has shifted upward. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by same-period arrivals in P1 through P7. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the increased volatility observed in the spring demand regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock level that prevents stockouts during this seasonal uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P3-P7 average demand (346.6) is ~30% higher than historical mean (266), driven by spring seasonality for trainer socks as of April 1st.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product is trainer socks, which are in peak spring demand. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 recorded cycles. Demand History: [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415, 382]. The mean of the entire history (including seeds) is approximately 329. However, focusing on the recent spring regime (Periods 3-8), the mean is 352.5 with a standard deviation of 58.6. Demand in the last two weeks (415, 382) indicates sustained high volume. Setting L to default (0 periods) as the system is stable. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current spring demand regime (P3-P8) while filtering out the volatile P2 outlier (548) and the earlier winter startup phase, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L) remains robust against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, and we are managing '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks'. Demand for trainer socks typically rises in spring as the weather warms. Historical data for the last 5 periods (P5-P9) shows demand values of [252, 329, 415, 382, 322], averaging 340 units. This is significantly higher than the initial historical mean of 266, confirming the spring seasonality pattern noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand has stabilized somewhat around this higher level. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (all orders from P1-P9 arrived in the same period they were placed), so I will use the default lead time setting.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in a sustained high-demand period associated with spring (March/April). Since Period 3, the demand has consistently remained above the historical mean of 266, with the last 8 periods (P3-P10) averaging 343 units. The most recent demand (P10) was 308. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To ensure sufficient stock while honoring the spring seasonality, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this elevated demand regime (P3-P10). This yields a projected mean (mu_hat) of ~343 per period since L=0. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=8 window to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the 95th percentile of expected demand for the current period, balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29th, 2019. The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in peak spring demand. In Period 11, demand surged to 427, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was only 389. This confirms a trend of high demand during the transition into May. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Since we started with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit at the start of Period 12, the OR engine must order enough to cover Period 12's forecasted demand. Analysis of recent history (P7-P11) shows an average demand of 370.8 with significant volatility (std ~45-50). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated and volatile spring demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level appropriate for the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April: Period 11 saw a stockout with demand (427) significantly exceeding the recent 5-period average (370.8).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6th) continues the peak spring season for trainer socks. Demand in Period 11 (427) and Period 12 (438) resulted in stockouts, indicating our previous target levels were too low for the current demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 375.4, but the most recent two periods suggest a shift toward >430 units. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated seasonal mean, while also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in late April (standard deviation of ~60). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, so L remains at 'default'. Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend aims for a high service level given the $4/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost ratio (target cycle service level ~80%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in early May: Period 11-12 demand (avg 432.5) represents a sustained peak and caused consecutive stockouts, moving above the previous April average of ~370.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal as the weather warms up in May. Previous periods (P11, P12) saw stockouts with demand ranging between 427-438 units. While Period 13 demand dropped to 267, this appears to be a weekly fluctuation rather than a trend reversal, as we are currently in the mid-May peak season. The moving average of the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 377 units, and the last 7 periods (P7-P13) is 365.5 units. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) and the risk of stockouts during the peak season, I will use recent_N=7 to capture the elevated spring demand while smoothing out the P13 dip. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. Historical demand analysis shows a distinct peak period in late April/early May (Periods 11-12, average ~432) which has since moderated. The last two periods (P13 and P14) showed lower demands of 267 and 275 respectively. This suggests the initial spring surge for trainer socks has stabilized as the season progresses. I am setting the demand parameters based on a recent window that captures this stabilization while acknowledging the higher baseline compared to the very early periods of the year. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift from the peak back to more stable current levels (averaging ~352 over P11-P14), which allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin for remaining seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in mid-May: After a peak in late April (P11-P12 avg 432), demand in P13-P14 softened to an average of 271, suggesting the primary spring peak for trainer socks has passed.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27), demand for fine-knit trainer socks has transitioned from the spring peak observed in late April (Periods 11-12, average demand 432.5) to a stabilized but volatile late-spring level. Specifically, the last three periods (P13-P15) have averaged 296.7 units, though Period 15 saw a rebound to 348 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (mean ~351) to capture the current post-peak baseline while acknowledging the volatility seen in the shift. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 samples to reflect the recent high variance, ensuring the safety stock can handle potential early-summer demand fluctuations. This balances the risk of overstocking as the peak fades against the risk of stockouts from summer demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-spring peak: Period 13-15 demand (avg 296.7) is lower than the April peak (avg ~430) but remains higher than winter baseline (~260), indicating a summer plateau.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which saw a peak in late April/early May (P11-P12 avg demand ~430) and has since transitioned into a summer plateau. The demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) has been [267, 275, 348, 370], averaging 315. The most recent two periods (348, 370) suggest demand is trending back toward the 350-370 range as summer begins, up from the mid-May dip. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this summer plateau while acknowledging the recent upward trend from the May lows, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to weight the current regime accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to capture current volatility without being skewed by the massive April stockout spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau confirmed in June: Demand in P15-P16 (348, 370) indicates stabilization around 350-370 units, higher than the mid-May dip (avg 271) but below the spring peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 10th (Period 18), the product (trainer socks) is in a summer plateau phase. Following the spring peak (late April/early May), demand has stabilized. In the last three periods (P15-P17), demand was 348, 370, and 297, averaging 338.3. This is significantly higher than the initial baseline (avg 266) but lower than the peak (avg ~430). The current demand of 297 in Period 17 marks a slight decrease from the end-of-May levels. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for the current summer plateau while remaining responsive to slight mid-June fluctuations, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the post-peak behavior (covering Periods 13 to 17, which include the stabilization and the most recent June observation).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a sustained summer demand plateau. Over the last four periods (P15-P18), demand has been 348, 370, 297, and 294, averaging 327.25 units. This is lower than the volatile April/early May peak (which saw demand up to 438) but significantly higher than the initial February baseline. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as all orders since Period 1 have arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (z \u2248 0.84). To capture the current summer stabilization and move away from the noise of the spring peak, I will use a recent_N of 4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This aligns the inventory base stock with the current demand level (~327) rather than the all-time average or the extreme peak periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24th. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks has transitioned from the high spring peak (April-May) into a stable summer plateau. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 328.6 units (348, 370, 297, 294, 334), which is higher than the initial winter baseline but lower than the April peak. There is no evidence of missing shipments as all orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods as promised. Given the consistent demand pattern over the last five weeks, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this summer level while remaining responsive to slight fluctuations. I will maintain the lead time (L) at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand plateau confirmed for June: Average demand for P15-P19 is 328.6 units, reflecting a stable phase for trainer socks after the spring peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in a summer demand plateau. Current date is 2019/7/1. Demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has been 370, 297, 294, 334, and 289, giving an average of 316.8 units. This is slightly lower than the previous June estimate but confirms a stable regime post-spring peak. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain the optimal service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) and account for the stable summer plateau, I will use a recent history of N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current regime while filtering out the volatile spring peak (P11-P12).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is trainer socks, which are currently in a stable summer demand plateau (July 8th). Looking at the demand from Period 15 to Period 21, the average demand is approximately 318.4 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P17-P21) show demand levels of 297, 294, 334, 289, and 317, which yields an average of 306.2. This indicates a very stable regime compared to the volatile spring peak observed in April/May. Since the current on-hand inventory is low (29 units) and the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable summer baseline while allowing the OR engine to maintain sufficient safety stock for minor fluctuations. Using N=5 provides a robust yet responsive estimate of the current plateau.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is trainer socks, which are currently in a mid-summer demand plateau (July 15). Analysis of recent demand from Period 17 to Period 22 shows values of 297, 294, 334, 289, 317, and 313. This yields a stable mean of approximately 307 units. The promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met throughout the history, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed (W=0). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this current summer plateau. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current stability and avoid overstocking during this lower-volatility phase compared to the spring peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its summer demand plateau. From Period 15 to Period 23 (9 weeks), demand has been relatively stable, averaging 321 units per week. The last period (P23) saw demand of 352, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The summer plateau is well-established with more consistent demand than the volatile spring peak. To capture this steady summer state and recover from the minor stockout in P23, I will use recent_N with N=9 to reflect the average demand (approx. 320) and standard deviation observed since mid-May. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. By using N=9, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~321 plus a safety buffer appropriate for the summer volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which experienced a spring seasonality peak in April/May (Period 11-12) and has since settled into a summer demand plateau. Over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), demand has averaged 319.2 units, with a standard deviation of 33.5. Recent demand in P24 was 277, following a stockout-limited Period 23. The 'summer plateau' identified in previous carry-over insights remains the dominant regime. I will use recent_N based on the last 10 periods (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilization while filtering out the volatile spring peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical cycles.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5th. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks is in a post-peak summer phase. Looking at the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the average demand is 303 units (317, 313, 352, 277, 256), which is slightly lower than the June average (approx 328) but higher than the mid-May dip. There is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks (277, 256) as we move into late summer. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking as the summer season eventually winds down, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current late-summer regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the most recent sales pace of ~300 units/period while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in July.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand shift: Period 21-25 average demand is 303 units, showing a slight decrease from the June plateau of 328 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the late summer period for trainer socks. Reviewing recent history, demand has entered a new lower regime following the spring peak and June plateau. The average demand for the last five periods (P22-P26) is 291.2 units, a decrease from the previous phase. Period 26 demand was 258 units. No supply chain issues are noted, as lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current late-summer baseline while maintaining a safety buffer. The OR backend will use these values to reach a base stock roughly equal to 291 + z*38, which should successfully cover demand while moving through August towards the autumn transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19th. The product is trainer socks, which typically see high demand during spring and summer and a decline as autumn approaches. Analysis of recent demand shows a cluster around ~270-300 units: P24-P27 demands are [277, 256, 258, 301], averaging 273 units. This is a noticeable step down from the June/July plateau of ~330 units, as noted in the Carry-over Insight for Period 26. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this late-summer softening while maintaining enough stock for potential late August heatwaves or back-to-school demand, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (covering P23-P27) to capture this downward trend while including the higher P23 data point for safety. I will use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a stable volatility estimate across the recent summer months.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (2019/8/26), we are transitioning from late summer into early autumn. Historical demand for these 'fine-knit trainer socks' shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring peak (late April/early May) followed by a summer plateau around 310-330 units. Recent demand (P24-P28) has averaged 277.2 units, indicating a gradual decline as the summer season ends. The most recent demand was 294. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods according to all 'conclude' messages. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-summer stabilization/softening while remaining sensitive to the subtle downtrend. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1=1) while accounting for the moderate volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand stabilization confirmed: Period 24-28 demand average is 277 units, down from the June/July plateau of ~320 units, reflecting the end of peak trainer sock season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering early September (2019/9/2). Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal progression for trainer socks. Following the spring peak (~430 units) and summer plateau (~320 units), demand has further softened as we move towards autumn. The average demand for the most recent five periods (P25-P29) is 267.6 units, compared to the June plateau average of 328 units. This confirms the 'late summer demand stabilization' noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given the SKU is a trainer sock, demand is likely to continue a gradual descent or settle into a lower baseline as temperatures drop. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower late-summer/early-autumn demand regime (avg ~268), which is significantly lower than previous months. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per confirmed 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn demand transition: Period 25-29 average demand (267.6) is ~18% lower than the June/July plateau (~325), indicating a seasonal shift away from trainer socks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 31 (Sept 9th). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', which is inherently seasonal (peaking in spring/summer). Recent demand data confirms a transition into autumn: Period 26-30 average demand is 251.2 units, significantly lower than the July average (~310) and the spring peak (~430). Specifically, the last two periods (P29-P30) averaged 251.5 units. As we move further into September, demand for trainer socks is expected to remain at this lower baseline or decrease further. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent autumn transition while maintaining enough data points (P26-P30) to smooth out volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transition confirmed: Period 26-30 average demand (251.2) is ~22% lower than the summer plateau (~325), reflecting a sustained seasonal decline for trainer socks as of September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16th, moving further into the autumn season. Demand for 'trainer socks' typically declines as the weather cools. The carry-over insights and recent history confirm a sustained downward shift from the summer plateau (~325 units). Specifically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 270.4 units, and the last 3 periods (P29-P31) average 252.3 units. Given this cooling trend and the shift identified in Carry-over Insight Period 31, I will use a recent_N of 5 to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the seasonal decline while maintaining enough sample size to account for weekly volatility. The 'calculate' method for lead time remains appropriate as arrivals have consistently been L=0.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23rd, 2019. We are firmly in the autumn season for SKU 372860001 (trainer socks), which typically sees a decrease in demand compared to the spring and summer months. The demand history confirms this trend: the average demand for the last five periods (P28-P32) is approximately 259.8 units, which is a notable decline from the summer plateau (approx. 325 units) and is approaching the winter baseline (~260 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given the consistent downward trend and stabilization near the baseline, I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio without overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Period 28-32 average demand (259.8) signifies a return to the winter baseline, confirming the end of the 2019 trainer sock peak season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering the autumn/winter season. Period 33 observed a sudden demand spike (405 units), which contrasts with the recent trend of stabilization around the 250-260 range (P28-P32 avg: 259.8). Given the historical context of spring/summer peaks (April avg ~430, June/July avg ~325), this spike is likely volatility rather than a sustained regime shift, though it may indicate a late-season promotional event or early autumn stock-up. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 33. To protect against another high-demand period while respecting the lower seasonal baseline, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat (avg 288) and sigma_hat. This balances the recent return to baseline with the caution required by the recent stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is currently in a post-summer transition phase (October). After a seasonal decline in September, demand spiked unexpectedly in the last two periods: P33 saw demand of 405 (causing a stockout) and P34 saw 312. The average demand over the last two periods is 358.5, which is significantly higher than the September average of approximately 250. This surge may represent a secondary peak or late-season clearance demand. To respond to this increased volatility and prevent further stockouts while inventory is low (30 units on hand), I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N calculation using the last 3 periods (average ~322) to capture this recent momentum. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility (405 vs 248) observed in the last few weeks. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Unexpected demand surge in late September/early October: Period 33-34 demand (avg 358.5) is ~40% higher than the September baseline (avg 251), contrasting with the expected autumn decline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks showed an unexpected surge in late September (P33-P34 avg 358.5) but has subsequently moderated. Period 35 demand was 266 units, which aligns more closely with the typical winter baseline of ~260 observed earlier in the season. The date is October 14th, moving further into autumn when trainer sock demand typically remains low. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 31-35) to capture the recent volatility caused by the late-September peak while also acknowledging the most Recent return to baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in the late October period. Demand spiked unexpectedly in late September (P33-34 avg 358) but has since corrected back towards the autumn baseline. Specifically, demand in P35-36 averaged 253 units, which aligns closely with the September baseline of ~251 units identified in Period 31. This suggests the surge was temporary. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period). Given the return to baseline demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) to capture this stabilization while acknowledging the recent volatility. This prevents over-ordering based on the P33 surge while maintaining sufficient stock for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-late September surge: Period 35-36 demand (avg 253) has returned to the autumn baseline observed in early September (avg ~251).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Historical demand for fine-knit trainer socks typically peaks in spring/early summer and returns to a baseline in autumn. Following a brief demand surge in late September (P33-P34 avg 358), the most recent demand (P35-P37) shows a return to stability with an average of 270.7 units. Specifically, Period 37 demand was 306. The inferred lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs as we enter late autumn, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the post-surge stabilization (Avg[266, 240, 306] * (1+0) = 270.7). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect current demand volatility (std[266, 240, 306] * sqrt(1) = 33).

Carry-over insight: Post-surge stabilization confirmed: Period 35-37 demand (avg 270.7) shows a return to the autumn baseline following the unexpected late September surge.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the post-summer/autumn baseline for trainer socks. Following an unexpected demand surge in late September (P33-P34 avg 358.5), demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P35-P38) with an average of 272 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P36-P38) show a mean of 274 units. This aligns with the 'autumn baseline' identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this stable autumn regime while setting the service level based on the high profit-to-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile). On-hand inventory is low (23), but since Lead Time is 0, the order arriving this period will satisfy current demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Sock'. The current date is November 11, 2019. Historically, demand for trainer socks peaks in spring (April/May) and stays high through summer, declining towards a winter baseline. Recent history (P35-P39) shows demand has stabilized back to an autumn baseline with an average of 265.8 units (266, 240, 306, 276, 241). This matches the Carry-over Insight from Period 38 regarding post-surge stabilization. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. For Period 40, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized autumn regime while ignoring the late September surge. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these recent 5 samples (P35-P39) ensures we maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio without overstocking during the low season.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the winter period. The product is trainer socks, which historically showed a return to baseline demand (approx 250-260 units) after the spring/summer peak. Recent demand (P38-P41: 276, 241, 252, 210) confirms this stabilization at a lower level, with the last period being the lowest in this sequence. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this late autumn cooling trend while maintaining a safe stock level (avg demand P37-P41 is ~257). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current lower volatility compared to the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline stabilization confirmed: Period 38-41 demand (avg 244.75) shows a consistent decline and stabilization at the lower winter level for trainer socks.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). Historically, this item follows seasonal patterns: a spring peak (April-May) and a summer plateau, followed by a decline to a winter baseline (~240-260 units). Period 42 showed an unexpected spike in demand (354) which caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). This surge on Dec 2nd might be related to Cyber Monday/Black Friday shopping trends or early holiday gift purchasing. However, the overall regime since Period 38 (late October) has averaged 266.6 units. Given the stockout in P42 and the start of the December holiday season, I will adjust mu_hat to account for the recent surge while anchoring to the established winter level. I'll use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat (averaging 262.2, which includes the spike and the lower baseline) and N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility (std dev ~54). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 9th, 2019. This SKU (trainer socks) is in its winter baseline period. Historically, demand for this product has fluctuated between 210 and 354 units over the last 6 periods (P38-P43), with a mean of 246. Period 43 saw a significant drop to 143 units, which may be a single-period outlier or the start of a deeper winter lull. Currently, there is 170 units on-hand and nothing in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR engine will target a high service level. To avoid over-reacting to the single low data point in P43 while acknowledging the general winter downtrend, I am using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the winter baseline (avg ~246) while smoothing the impact of the P43 dip. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P45 (2019/12/16), mid-December. Demand for trainer socks has historically been lower during the winter months compared to the spring/summer peak. Recent demand in P43-P44 (avg 176) is significantly lower than the P38-P42 winter baseline (avg 266), suggesting a deeper December trough. However, a slight uptick might occur as we approach year-end. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand and volatility to capture the stabilization into the winter baseline while accounting for the recent dips in December. On-hand is 96 units, and the backend with L=0 will target a base stock covering the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: December demand trough: Period 43-44 demand (avg 176) is ~35% lower than the established November winter baseline (~270), marking a seasonal low for trainer socks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the depth of the winter trough for trainer socks. Demand in the most recent periods (P43-P45) has been 143, 209, and 231, averaging approximately 194 units. This is significantly lower than the November baseline (~270) and consistent with the expected seasonal dip for this product category during winter. While there was a slight increase in P45 (231), it likely represents minor pre-Christmas activity rather than a shift in the primary regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower seasonal baseline (avg ~194) and set lead time to 'calculate' as historical arrivals have consistently matched the promised 0-period lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30th. Historically, Period 47 coincides with the end of the calendar year and the deepest winter trough for 'trainer socks'. Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly from the summer/autumn levels. Over the last four periods (P43-P46), the average demand is 201.75 units, compared to the November baseline of ~270 units. Specifically, P43-P44 averaged 176, but P45-P46 saw a slight relative increase to 227.5. Given the product's low seasonality in mid-winter, I will use a recent_N window of 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this lower late-December demand level while respecting the slight variance at the end of the year. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to capture current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year demand trough confirmed: Period 43-46 average demand (201.8) is ~25% lower than the November baseline (~270), marking the seasonal minimum for trainer socks.
