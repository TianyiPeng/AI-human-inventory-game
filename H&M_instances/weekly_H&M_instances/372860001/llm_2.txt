The current date is 2019/2/11 (mid-February), a standard retail period across many regions. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 1 arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. There is currently 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts while accounting for a mean demand of ~266, I will order 280 units. This provides a small buffer for the highest historical sample (302) while minimizing holding costs (which are significant at $1.0/unit) given the same-day delivery capability.",

Selling 1 unit yields $4, while holding 1 unit costs $1; the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a high service level is optimal to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 1 and 2. e) Decision: Anticipating demand around 450 units to account for the spring uptick and historical variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019. Historically, fine-knit trainer socks for women experience a minor demand increase during the Christmas/Holiday season (P42 saw a spike of 354, followed by a stabilization around 220-230 in P45-P46). As we move into the first week of January, demand typically softens significantly after the New Year celebrations as retail activity cools down and the winter season (less suitable for 'trainer' socks) continues. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 76 units. Recent demand (P45: 231, P46: 224) suggests a baseline around 230 units, but a post-holiday dip is expected in early January. I will target an availability of approximately 210 units to cover the expected lower demand while minimizing holding costs for the next period, necessitating an order of roughly 134 units.",
