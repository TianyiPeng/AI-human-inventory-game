Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] shows an average of 266.4 and a standard deviation of 26.6. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in the same period. Given the product type (basic socks) and the date (mid-February), demand appears relatively stable without immediate seasonal spikes expected. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand level (avg 266.4) and volatility. With L=0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period (1+0)*266.4. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is Womens trainer socks. Historical demand for the last 5 periods was [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], and Period 1's demand was 287. The demand is relatively stable, averaging around 270 units per week. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0), confirming this. On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so we need to restock to cover the upcoming period. Since the data is stable and we only have one period of in-game history, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent trend without being overly influenced by the single Period 1 observation, while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1172.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's socks, and we are entering Late February/Early March. Historical data shows demand was stable around 270 units, until Period 2 (Feb 18) where demand spiked to 548 units. This is a significant 100% increase, likely due to a seasonal shift or promotion. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent spike more aggressively than a long-term average, ensuring the base stock level adapts to the higher demand regime while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 2: demand increased from an average of ~270 to 548 (+100%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1495.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a demand shift as we transition from February into March. Period 1 demand was 287, but Periods 2 and 3 saw a significant increase (548 and 399 respectively), averaging 473.5. This coincides with the approach of Spring, where trainer socks typically see higher demand. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). Given the recent volatility and the demand regime shift identified in Period 3, I am using recent_N (N=2) to capture the higher mean and variance from the last two periods. This will allow the OR engine to set a higher base stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 2, while balancing the $1.00 holding cost against the $4.00 profit.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 2. After an initial spike to 548 in Period 2, demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the pre-shift average (initial samples: ~270, Periods 3-4: ~368). The promised lead time is 0, and historical delivery data (Periods 1-4) confirms that the actual lead time is indeed 0, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To accurately capture the new demand baseline and volatility, I am using a recent window of N=3 (Periods 2-4). This balances the high outlier in P2 with the more moderate P3-P4 levels. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a service level of 80% ($4.0 / ($4.0 + $1.0)) while keeping inventory lean for same-day delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: post-Period 1 average increased from ~270 to ~428 (+58%), with more recent demand (P3-P4) settling around 368.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees stable demand but can fluctuate with seasonal transitions. Current date is mid-March. Historical demand shows a spike in Period 2 (548) followed by a gradual decline (399, 338, 252). The 'Past demands' provided in the prompt [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] suggest an initial baseline around 266, while recent observations (P1-P5) average 364.8. However, the last three periods (P3-P5) show a clear downward trend from the spike. The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms actual lead time is 0. With on-hand inventory at 268 and the most recent demand at 252, the current stock covers roughly one period. To account for the recent stabilization after the Period 2 spike while acknowledging the downward trend back toward the historical baseline, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average of 399, 338, 252 is 329.7) to avoid overreacting to the older outlier while staying responsive to the current level. Sigma will use recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the entire recent active period.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean returning toward baseline: after a Period 2 spike (548), demand has decreased for three consecutive periods (399 to 252).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) exhibits a stable lead time of 0 periods. After a significant demand spike in Period 2 (548 units), demand has stabilized over the last four periods (Periods 3-6) with an average of 329.5 units (399, 338, 252, 329). The 'Carry-over insights' correctly identified a return toward the baseline. Given the current date is late March (approaching Spring), demand for 'trainer socks' typically remains steady or increases slightly as weather warms. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spike demand regime. The current on-hand inventory is 99 units, so setting the base stock against a mean of ~330 plus safety stock will trigger an order to cover the immediate period demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-spike (P3-P6): Mean ~330 units, down from P2 peak but above P1 baseline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product is trainer socks. We entered the period with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit following a stockout in Period 7 where demand (415) exceeded available stock (381). Demand is volatile: after a spike in Period 2 (548), it subsided toward 252 (P5) but has surged again recently (329 in P6, 415 in P7). This upward trend correlates with the transition into Spring (April), where demand for trainer socks typically increases. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 332, and the average since the start is 366.8. Given the stockout and seasonal timing, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current upward momentum while the OR engine's high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 implies an 80% service level target) will naturally provide a buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend confirmed: consecutive increases from 252 (P5) to 329 (P6) to 415 (P7), likely driven by seasonal relevance of trainer socks in April.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is entering high demand as weights and temperatures shift in April (Date: 2019/4/8). Historical data shows a recent demand uptrend (P5: 252, P6: 329, P7: 415, P8: 382), with an average of approximately 365 over the last 4 periods. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met across all periods (P1-P8). Current on-hand inventory is very low (19 units) following high sales. To capture the seasonal trend and ensure high service levels (critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods which represent the spring season transition. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*mean_recent where L=0, effectively targeting one period of demand (approx 365-380 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1205.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees increasing demand as spring progresses. Recent demand history shows a spike in P7 (415) followed by a slight cooling in P8 (382) and P9 (322). However, historical demand (including the provided seed data) suggests an underlying mean of approximately 300-350 units. Observation of the 'conclude' messages confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current spring demand regime (since Period 6), which averages ~362 units. This allows the OR engine to react to the recent higher baseline compared to the winter months, while accounting for the recent drop from 415 to 322. Providing a tight sigma using the same window will avoid excessive holding costs in a high-turnover environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1140.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 11 (starting April 22nd) shows a stabilization following the early-April peak. Over the last four periods (P7-P10), demand values were 415, 382, 322, and 308, indicating a gentle tapering from the spring spike as we move into late April. The mean of the last 4 periods is 356.75, compared to the overall mean which is skewed by earlier volatile swings. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the current stabilization while maintaining a safety buffer for potential late-spring variability, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4. This reflects the most recent demand regime (post-peak stabilization) and ensures the OR engine calculates base stock levels relative to the current pace of sales (approx. 357 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-early April peak: Mean demand for P7-P10 is 357 units, showing a gradual decline from 415 to 308.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29th. The product is trainer socks, which typically see high demand during spring and early summer. Period 11 saw a significant demand spike to 427 units, likely reflecting late-April seasonality or stock-out effects from previous periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has averaged 370.8 units, but given the recent jump to 427 and the seasonal context (late April/early May), I will use a shorter window (N=4) to capture the current elevated demand level (average of P8-P11 is 359.75, which is more stable though Period 11 suggests an upward trend). Setting N=4 allows the model to react to the recent high volatility while maintaining a safety buffer. I will keep L at default as the O-period delivery is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late April: Period 11 demand spiked to 427 units, exceeding the 4-period average of 357. Trainer socks seasonal demand is currently near its peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences peak demand during late spring and summer (May-August in the Northern Hemisphere). Current data confirms this seasonal uptrend: demand has risen from 308 (P10) to 427 (P11) and 438 (P12). We are now in early May, where demand is consistently high. Actual lead time has been stable at 0 periods throughout the history. To ensure we capture this rising demand and avoid the frequent stock-outs observed in P11 and P12 (sold = starting inventory, ending inventory = 0), I will use a shorter window (recent_N with N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime (avg = 391) rather than the lower averages from earlier months. Setting N=3 for mu_hat yields a base demand forecast of (1+0)*391 = 391, and N=3 for sigma_hat captures the recent volatility (std dev of [308, 427, 438] is ~72).

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal uptrend for trainer socks confirmed: Mean demand increased from 339 (P7-P10) to 432 (P11-P12), +27% increase into the May peak period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences high seasonal demand during the spring and summer months. Looking at the history, demand spiked significantly in late April (P11, P12 at ~430 units) but dropped sharply to 267 units in Period 13. Given the seasonality of trainer socks, I suspect this drop might be a temporary fluctuation rather than a trend reversal, as warmer weather usually sustains demand for this category through May and June. However, I must balance the risk of holding costs. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set mu_hat using a recent window of 3 periods (P11-P13) which averages 377 units, providing a buffer against the recent drop while acknowledging the high-demand regime of late spring. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to capture the recent increase in volatility (267 to 438 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand volatility transition observed in mid-May; P13 demand (267) represents a 40% drop from the P11-P12 peak (432), though trainer socks season is still active.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal for spring and summer. History shows a peak in late April/early May (P11-P12 at ~430 units) followed by a notable drop in the last two periods (P13-P14 averaging 271 units). This suggests the initial spring surge has passed, and we are entering a mid-season consumption phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (averaging P11-P14: 427, 438, 267, 275 \u2248 352 units) to capture this recent stabilization at a lower-than-peak level while maintaining enough inventory if demand fluctuates back up (as trainer socks remain relevant through summer). I will use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility seen between the late April peak and the mid-May dip, ensuring the OR backend maintains an appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-peak stabilization: Demand for mid-May (P13-P14) has stabilized around 271 units, a ~37% reduction from the late April peak of ~432.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering late May. Historically, we saw a peak in late April (P12: 438) followed by a stabilization phase. The recent demand history is: P13: 267, P14: 275, P15: 348. This shows that despite the seasonal Peak having passed, demand remains robust (average of last 3 periods is 296). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals (P1 through P15). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a slightly aggressive base stock to capture demand spikes like the one seen in P15. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-peak stabilization level and volatility, while sticking to the calculate method for lead time as '0' has been extremely stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-April peak (P13-P15) has stabilized at a mean of ~297 units, showing high volatility (range 267 to 348). Seasonality for trainer socks remains active but below the April maximum.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in its peak early summer season (June/July). Demand has shown a recent increase from the post-April dip, rising from a mean of ~297 (P13-P15) to 370 in Period 16. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given that Period 16 ended with 0 inventory and unmet demand (sold 335 vs demand 370), I must ensure the order covers the upward seasonal trend as temperatures rise in June. I will use a recent_N of 4 for demand (P13-P16) to capture the trend change, which averages 315 units, but I will apply an explicit mu_hat of 380 to account for the current upward momentum and prevent stockouts seen in P16. Sigma will be calculated over the same 4-period window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend re-established in June: Period 16 demand (370) is high relative to the May average (~297), aligning with peak trainer sock seasonality.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is currently in its peak summer season (June). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Demand remains volatile but high. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 297, following a spike of 370 in Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the mean demand is approximately 311 units. Given the transition into June and the high demand seen in P11-P12 (avg 432) and P16 (370), I anticipate demand will stay elevated through the peak summer months. To capture this recent trend while accounting for volatility, I am using a recent_N window of 5 periods (P13-P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the lower demand observed in mid-May with the higher demand spikes seen as we moved into June. Setting L to default (0) as lead time is stable.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is currently in a seasonally active period (June). Demand has stabilized over the last three weeks (P16-P18: 370, 297, 294) with a mean of 320.3 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 17 correctly identified an uptrend in early June, but the most recent two weeks show a stabilization around the ~300 mark. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, suggesting an 80% service level), the OR backend should be set to capture recent June dynamics. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this stabilized June period, and keep lead time at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained stability in June demand: Mean demand for P16-P18 is ~320 units, retreating from the late May peak and stabilizing at a level higher than the May average (~297).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in its peak summer seasonal phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all 19 concluded periods. Demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) has averaged 323.75 units (370, 297, 294, 334), showing stability following the volatile transitions of May. Given the critical 2019/6/24 date (approaching mid-summer), demand is expected to remain firm. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this June stability, while maintaining recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat to account for the broader range of seasonal fluctuations observed since mid-May (range 267 to 370). This approach ensures we maintain a base stock that covers current high demand levels without over-ordering as the season eventually turns.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', entering July (Period 21). Historical data shows peak demand occurred in April/May (up to 438 units), followed by a stabilization in June (Periods 16-20) with a mean of approximately 317 units (370, 297, 294, 334, 289). July 1st marks a potential shift as high summer demand remains relevant for trainer socks, but we are moving past the early summer peak. Demand in the last 5 periods (P16-P20) exhibits a mean of 316.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 32. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for sustained stability in the most recent regime while preparing for potential minor mid-summer fluctuations, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both demand and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in June (P16-P20) at a mean of ~317 units, retreating from the April peak (~430) but remaining consistent (+/- 10%) heading into July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) has entered July, which remains a core period for seasonal usage. Historical evidence from the last 6 periods (P16-P21) shows a very stable demand regime with a mean of 317 units and moderate volatility (range: 289-370). The most recent demand (P21) was exactly 317 units. Although the April/May peak saw higher spikes (~430), the current summer baseline is consistently around 315-320. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to parameterize \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, as this captures the stable summer regime post-May fluctuations. This will allow the OR backend to maintain sufficient stock for the stable demand while accounting for the recent variance observed in late June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its peak summer season, where demand typically remains strong and relatively stable. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) has shown consistent behavior with a mean of 316.7 units and a standard deviation of 27.6. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 23, I will use a recent_N strategy with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stable regime in the heart of summer. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current stable demand level (~317 units) while providing a safety buffer for the moderate volatility observed recently. The service level target remains high due to the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its peak summer season, where demand typically remains strong and stable. Observations from Period 16 through Period 23 show a consistent demand regime with a mean of approximately 320 units (Actual demands: 370, 297, 294, 334, 289, 317, 313, 352). Period 23 saw a slight demand spike to 352, resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the entire history. To respond to the stock-out in Period 23 and capture the sustained summer demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 (the stable regime since Period 16). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the current mean (~320) and the observed volatility in this window, ensuring high service levels during the seasonal peak while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in July (P16-P23) at a mean of ~321 units, demonstrating consistent seasonal demand for trainer socks with occasional spikes (e.g., P23 demand of 352).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks in late July (Period 24, Date: 2019/7/22) was 277 units, which is slightly lower than the recent 8-period average (P16-P23) of approximately 321 units. However, demand remained consistent within the identified 'July stabilization' regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 24 historical periods. Given the product's high seasonality for summer (July/August), I will maintain parameters based on the recent stable regime (N=9, covering P16-P24) to avoid overreacting to a single-period dip while ensuring sufficient stock for potential late-summer spikes. The service level target remains high (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), so providing a buffer for the recent mean of ~316 is appropriate.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of trainer socks, entering early August. Historically, demand for this item peaked in April/May and has shown a gradual downward trend through July as the peak summer season concludes. Demand in the last two periods (P24-P25) has dropped to 277 and 256 respectively, which is below the July average of ~321 units recorded in the carry-over insights. Total observed lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during the late-season decline while maintaining high service levels (profit $4 vs holding $1), I will use a recent window (N=6) of 315 units to calculate mu_hat. This window captures the recent descent from the July average while remaining responsive to the current 250-270 range. Sigma_hat will also use the last 6 periods to reflect the current moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak decline observed: Mean demand for Late July (P24-P25) decreased to 267 units, down ~17% from the P16-P23 July average of 321 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a post-peak seasonal decline as of mid-August. Demand has transitioned from a July average of ~321 units to a late July/early August average (P24-P26) of 263.7 units, reflecting a clear downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as indicated by the 'conclude' messages. Recent demand over the last 3 periods (P24: 277, P25: 256, P26: 258) shows high stability at this lower level. Therefore, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to use recent_N=3 to capture this local stability and prevent overstocking based on higher July demand. The base stock approach will naturally adjust to the lower mean and variance, while the backend's critical ratio (~0.8) will protect against minor stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline confirmed in August: Mean demand for P24-P26 is 264 units, a 18% decrease from the P16-P23 July mean (321), signaling the end of peak trainer sock seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a post-peak seasonal decline as of mid-August. While earlier insights suggested a regime mean of ~264 units (P24-P26), Period 27 demand was 301, showing that demand remains resilient even as it retreats from the July average of 321. The period 27 stockout (ending inventory 0) indicates we are currently under-ordered for the actual demand realization. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning we should aim for a service level that covers demand volatility effectively. I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilization/minor decline in August (Mean: ~273) while remaining responsive to the recent P27 uptick.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is currently in a late-August seasonal decline. Demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) follows a lower regime: [277, 256, 258, 301, 294], with a mean of 277.2 units. This is a significant drop from the July average of ~321. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization and the current volatility. Despite the stockout in P28, total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 0, so the OR backend needs to place an order to meet the next period's forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August (P24-P28) at a mean of ~277 units, confirming a ~14% decrease from the July seasonal peak (321 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks is entering a post-summer decline. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P24-P29) shows a mean of approximately 269 units (277, 256, 258, 301, 294, 229), compared to the July peak average of ~321. The period 29 demand (229) is the lowest in this recent cluster, confirming the downward seasonal trend as the school year starts and cooler weather approaches. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the observed stabilization at a lower level, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current late-August/early-September demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at its promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline in late August/early September: Mean demand for P24-P29 is 269 units, a ~16% reduction from the July seasonal average (321), reflecting post-summer seasonality.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a post-summer seasonal decline. Data from Period 24 to Period 30 shows a stabilized demand regime with a mean of approximately 270 units, down from the July peak of ~321 units. The most recent demand (P30) was 274, aligning perfectly with this new baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this post-peak stabilization (P24-P30). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The high service level targets are maintained by the OR backend (Profit=$4, Holding=$1), so using a recent window for mu and sigma will allow for sensitive but stable replenishment as we enter the autumn season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is past its peak summer seasonality (April-July). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 24 (late July). Over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), the mean demand is 267.8 units, compared to the July peak average of ~321. The most recent demand (P31) was 254 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this post-peak stabilization while smoothing out minor fluctuations like the P27 spike. The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as observed throughout the history. Setting parameters to reflect this lower, stable demand regime will help avoid excess inventory and high holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in September: Mean demand for P24-P31 (post-peak season) is ~268 units, consistent with the late August average and confirming a permanent shift from summer levels.

The current regime, characterized by post-peak decline and stabilization (P24-P32), shows a mean demand of approximately 266 units. Recent observations from Period 30 to Period 32 (274, 254, 248) confirm this stabilization at a lower level compared to the July/August timeframe. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stable demand and zero lead time, I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P24 to P32) to capture the post-peak mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that minimizes holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this current demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a significant spike in Period 33 (405 units), deviating from the post-peak summer stabilization mean of ~268 units observed between Periods 24-32. This spike occurred in late September, potentially linked to end-of-quarter promotions or a 'back-to-school/work' shopping surge. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (as observed in all prior 'conclude' messages), I need to adjust parameters to account for this recent volatility. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the shift from the stable late-August/September period while including the most recent spike, which will raise the base stock level to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a new base stock that balances the high demand against the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Abrupt demand spike in late September (P33: 405 units), breaking the stabilized mean of ~268 units established since Period 24.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in a transition phase. After a long period of stability (P24-P32 mean ~268), demand spiked significantly in Period 33 (405) and remained elevated in Period 34 (312). October demand (current date 2019/10/7) historically aligns with a second minor peak or stabilization after a post-summer dip, possibly driven by indoor gym activity or mild weather. The 'conclude' messages for P33 and P34 confirm a shift from the previous regime. To capture this recent increase without overreacting to the P33 outlier, I am using a recent_N of 3 (encompassing P32-P34). This yields a local mean of approx 321 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is very low (9 units), necessitating a significant order this period to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (75% service level target).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Mean demand increased from ~268 (P24-P32) to ~358 (P33-P34) in late September/early October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift starting at Period 33. Before Period 33, demand had stabilized around 268 units (P24-P32). In the last three periods (P33-P35), demand has been 405, 312, and 266 respectively. While P35 (266) returned to the previous baseline, the mean for the last three periods is approximately 328 units, which is a +22% increase over the previous regime. The product is trainer socks, which often see secondary spikes in October (back-to-school or late-season fitness trends). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the increased volatility and the recent mean shift, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent upward shift (mean 328), while setting N=5 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility introduced by the 405 unit spike in Period 33. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher recent average and the recent variability to prevent stockouts.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following a late September spike. The mean demand for the most recent 4 periods (P33-P36) is 305.75 units (405, 312, 266, 240), showing a downward trend after the P33 surge. October (current date 2019/10/21) typically sees lower demand for trainer socks compared to the summer months as colder weather approaches, though they remain a staple. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility accurately. This balances the risk of stockouts against the relatively high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit) by focusing on the latest stabilization trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime following the late September spike (P33) is trending downwards as October progresses: Mean demand for P34-P36 is 272.7 units (312, 266, 240), effectively returning to the pre-spike baseline of ~268.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase. After a significant spike in Period 33 (405 units), demand has moderated. The last four periods (P34-P37) have seen demands of 312, 266, 240, and 306, resulting in a mean of 281 units. This aligns with the 'Period 37' carry-over insight suggesting a return to the pre-spike baseline of ~268-270 units. With the current date being late October (P38), demand for trainer socks is expected to remain stable or slightly decline as colder weather approaches. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spike regime, which balances the recent 306 demand with the preceding downward trend to ensure sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-September spike: Mean demand for P34-P37 is 281 units, confirming a return to the late-summer baseline (~270) with moderate volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Historical demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown clear seasonal patterns, peaking in April/May and July, then stabilizing at a lower baseline in late autumn. The 'Period 38' carry-over insight confirms that after a brief late-September spike, demand has stabilized around a mean of ~281 units (calculated from P34-P37). Most recent demand in Period 38 was 276, further validating this level. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Inventory on-hand (34) is low relative to the expected demand (~270-280), necessitating a standard replenishment order to meet the immediate period demand and maintain a safety buffer. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable post-spike regime (P34-P38 mean is 280), and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect more recent volatility without the distraction of the distant summer peaks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable, late-autumn demand regime following a temporary spike in late September. Period 39 demand was 241, and the average since the post-spike stabilization (P34-P39) is approximately 273.5 units. As we are now in mid-November, trainer sock demand is generally lower than the spring/summer peak but remains relatively consistent for basic footwear. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time is 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the stabilized mean of ~274 units. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current moderate volatility (standard deviation of ~28 during this period). This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding over-stocking during the off-peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late autumn (P34-P39): mean demand is ~274 units (standard deviation ~28), significantly lower than the July peak but consistent with late-summer levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is basic trainer socks, an item that typically sees peak demand in spring/summer. Historical demand confirms this, with a July mean of ~321 units dropping to an autumn baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40, late Oct to mid-November), demand has been stable with a mean of 270.4 and a standard deviation of 27.6. The abrupt spike in late September (P33: 405) has not recurred. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current stable autumn demand regime, reflecting the seasonal wind-down. Lead time L is consistently 0 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks' has shown a gradual downward trend as we move further into late autumn/early winter, which is consistent with the product's seasonal profile. Specifically, the last three periods (P39-P41) have seen demands of 241, 252, and 210, with Period 41 reaching the lowest level in recent months. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P34-P41) is approximately 263 units, while the very recent 3-period average (P39-P41) is 234 units. Given this cooling trend, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-season demand levels (average ~238 units) while filtering out the slightly higher peaks from October. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by every 'conclude' message in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decline observed in late November: Mean demand for P39-P41 decreased to 234 units, down ~15% from the P34-P39 autumn average of 274 units, reflecting winter seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 43 (Dec 2), we are managing '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks'. The previous period (P42) saw a significant demand spike to 354 units, despite a recent downward trend into winter. This spike is likely driven by pre-Christmas shopping or promotional activity (Cyber Monday/seasonal gifting). The average demand for the last five periods (P38-P42) is 266 units, but given the volatility and the upcoming holiday season, I need to protect against further spikes. Historical data shows that trainer socks are seasonal, but basic packs often see secondary peaks during gift-giving periods. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent average including the P42 spike, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev of P38-P42 is approx 55). Starting on-hand is 0 due to the P42 stockout, so the backend will aim to replenish to the base stock level immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 354 observed in late November (P42), likely reflecting early holiday/gift shopping demand, deviating from the 'winter decline' observed in P39-P41.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering the mid-December period. Historically, demand for this product peaked in April/July (summer season) and has been generally lower in winter (P41: 210, P43: 143), with an isolated spike in late November (P42: 354) likely due to Black Friday/pre-holiday gift shopping. Period 43 demand (143) is significantly lower and likely represents a return to winter baseline. Given the current date (Dec 9), we anticipate demand to remain around the late-autumn/winter average (approx. 200-240 units) rather than the summer peak. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current winter demand level (mean of P41-P43 is ~235) while maintaining sigma_hat based on recent volatility to protect against holiday-induced variability.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday spike demand decline: Period 43 demand (143) decreased 60% from the Period 42 spike (354), returning to winter baseline for trainer socks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (Period 45). History shows that after a late November spike (P42 demand: 354), demand has significantly cooled off in early December (P43-P44 mean: 176 units). This aligns with the seasonal profile of 'trainer socks' becoming less popular in peak winter. On-hand inventory is 92 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the entire history. To set parameters for the OR backend, I am focusing on the most recent demand regime since the P42 spike. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 (covering Periods 42, 43, and 44) to capture the sharp transition from the spike back to the winter baseline. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the recent lower demand levels and the residual volatility from the spike. The backend will then calculate the order as min(base_stock - 92, cap).

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand (P43-P44) has stabilized at a low winter baseline of ~176 units following the late-November holiday spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in the flat post-holiday winter baseline for trainer socks. Period 45 demand was 231, and the average for the last three periods (P43-P45) is approximately 194 units. This represents a significant decline from the autumn average (~270) and the brief late-November spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To avoid overstocking during the low-demand winter period while maintaining service levels for potential minor New Year fitness-related upticks, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging P43-P45) to capture the current lower demand level of ~194 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=1). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility seen during the transition from the holiday spike (range 143 to 231).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at winter baseline: Mean demand for P43-P45 is ~194 units, reflecting a permanent decrease from autumn levels (~270) post-holiday season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30th (Period 47). The product is trainer socks, which typically see a seasonal decline during winter. Recent demand history shows a period of stabilization following a late-November holiday spike. Specifically, demands for P43 through P46 were [143, 209, 231, 224]. Using the last four samples (P43-P46), the mean demand is approximately 201.75 units per period. This confirms the 'winter baseline' mentioned in previous carry-over insights. For Period 47, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this stabilized winter demand level. Lead time persists at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period in history. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the current regime's volatility, which is relatively moderate. On-hand inventory is very low (9 units), necessitating an order that aligns with the calculated base stock for the 200+ unit demand expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at winter baseline: Mean demand for P43-P46 is ~202 units, consistent with post-holiday seasonal expectations for trainer socks.
