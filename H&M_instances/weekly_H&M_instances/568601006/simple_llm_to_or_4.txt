SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', categorized under 'Womens Tailoring / Dressed', which typically sees consistent demand in professional settings with potential lifts during the spring season. Historical demand for the preceding five time units shows a range between 145 and 196, with an average of approximately 173. The most recent data points [179, 196, 186] suggest a slightly higher level of activity compared to the earlier points [161, 145]. Given the date is Feb 11th, we are entering the pre-spring retail window where professional wear and transitional office attire often see stable or increasing interest. Since the most recent demand was 186 and the trend shows a slight upward bias from the training average, I will forecast a value consistent with the recent moving average while accounting for the stabilization observed in the last period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The initial training data showed an average of 173.4 units (range 145-196). Period 1 (Feb 11) saw a significant jump to 227 units, which is 30% higher than the previous average. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: February 18th falls during the transition into spring fashion and mid-season shopping. As a 'Dressed/Womens Tailoring' blazer, this item is highly relevant for professionals returning to work/office after the start of the year and as a spring transitional piece. 3. Trend: There is a clear upward trend from Period 1's 227 units compared to the training set. 4. Logic: Given the momentum into late February and the seasonal relevance of blazers for spring wardrobes, a slight increase from Period 1 is expected as the peak shopping period for spring tailored items approaches.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) is a 'Dressed' tailored piece, making it highly relevant for early spring wardrobe updates. Historical training data showed an average demand of 173 units. However, observed test data shows a significant jump: Period 1 reached 227 units and Period 2 grew to 284 units (+25% week-over-week). This indicates a strong upward trend as we move further into the spring season and closer to typical March retail peaks. The date February 25 is the final week of February, where consumer interest in workwear and transitional tailoring typically accelerates. Given the momentum from Period 2 and the seasonal relevance of the product, I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory, though perhaps at a slightly moderating growth rate as it stabilizes at this higher level.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical Pattern Summary: The initial training data showed a range of 145-196. Since the test phase started (Period 1-3), we have seen a significant shift upward with demands of 227 and 284, followed by a slight correction to 198. 2) Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. This is 'Womens Tailoring' (Blazer), which typically sees a seasonal uptick in early spring as customers refresh workwear and transition out of heavy winter coats. 3) Recent Trend: There is a clear regime shift from the training period (~173 avg) to the test period (~236 avg), representing a ~36% increase. The drop in Period 3 (198) suggests the peak of the initial spring surge may be stabilizing. 4) Final Forecast Logic: Given the product category's relevance to spring fashion and the observed higher baseline in recent weeks, I expect demand to remain above the historical average but settle slightly below the extreme peak of Period 2. A forecast of 215 accounts for the transition into March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Baseline increased from training average of 173 to test phase average of 236 (+36%) coinciding with the start of the Spring retail season for tailoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $818.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 173 units. Since entering the Spring retail season (Period 1 of test phase), the demand baseline shifted upward, averaging 230.75 units over the last four weeks. Specifically, Periods 3 (198) and 4 (214) show a slight stabilization following a high peak in Period 2 (284). The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, which typically sees sustained demand throughout March as consumers update professional wardrobes for Spring. Given the current date of March 11, we are in a peak seasonal window. The most recent demand (214) and the four-week test average (231) suggest a forecast that maintains this higher regime while accounting for minor fluctuations. I expect demand to remain consistent with the recent two-week average.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -4 to 0) averaged 173 units. Entering the test phase (Periods 1-5), the average demand increased to 227.6 units, reflecting a clear regime shift associated with the Spring retail season for 'Womens Tailoring' (Blazers). Specifically, demand peaked in Period 2 (284) but has stabilized over the last three periods (198, 214, 215), creating a new localized mean of approximately 209 units. For Period 6 (2019/3/18), the product remains highly relevant for mid-spring dressing. Given the stability over the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain near this new baseline, with a slight upward bias as the season progresses towards peak spring shopping.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173. The 'Carry-Over Insight' from Period 4 noted a regime shift to an average of ~236. Looking at the last four periods (P3-P6), the demand has stabilized significantly: 198, 214, 215, 215. This suggests the initial spike in P2 (284) was an outlier or a temporary peak, and the new baseline for this 'Womens Tailoring' blazer in mid-to-late March is holding steady at approximately 215. As we are currently at March 25th, we are deep into the Spring retail season but before the typical Easter-related spikes. Given the three consecutive periods of near-identical demand (214, 215, 215), I will forecast a continuation of this stable baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed: Periods 4 through 6 demonstrate a tight clustering around 215 units, suggesting a stabilized Spring baseline following the initial seasonal shift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. Since the start of the test phase (Spring retail season), demand shifted upward. Periods 4-6 showed high stability at approximately 215 units. However, Period 7 (March 25) saw a drop to 186 units. Analysis of the current date (April 1) suggests a typical pre-Easter or early-month dip often seen in retail before mid-month spring shopping peaks. The recent drop from 215 to 186 signals a softening of the peak spring surge or a temporary fluctuation. I will weight the most recent observation (186) alongside the established spring baseline (215), forecasting a slight recovery towards the mean as April begins, while accounting for the recent downward pressure.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear shift in Period 4 to a higher baseline (avg ~215) compared to training data (avg ~173). Recent performance in the test phase indicates some volatility around this baseline. Period 7 saw a dip to 186, while Period 8 (April 1st) spiked to 249, likely due to a combination of professional attire needs at the start of the month and early spring demand. The current date (April 8th) is post-spike but remains within the peak spring retail season for women's tailoring. Given that Period 8 was quite high, a slight mean reversion is expected, though demand should remain above the Period 7 low. I am forecasting a stabilization towards the established spring baseline of 215-220 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a baseline shift in the Spring season (starting Period 4) ranging between 178 and 249 units. Recent data shows high volatility: Period 8 spiked to 249, followed by a drop to 178 in Period 9. The current date (April 15, 2019) is the week leading into Easter (April 21), which typically serves as a peak period for 'Dressed' products like blazers as consumers shop for holiday attire. Given the average of the last 6 periods (test phase Spring baseline) is approximately 206, and factoring in the anticipated pre-holiday lift, demand is expected to recover significantly from the Period 9 low.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a Training Period average of 173, with an early Spring peak (Period 2) and a stabilized average of 200 during Periods 1-9. However, Period 10 shows a significant drop to 130 units. The current date is 2019/04/22 (Monday), immediately following Easter Sunday (April 21, 2019). Apparel demand, particularly for 'Dressed' tailoring like the Mariette Blazer, often experiences a post-holiday slump as the primary occasion for wear (Easter/Spring events) has passed. Given the sharp decline in Period 10 (pre-Easter week) and the likelihood of reduced demand immediately following the holiday, I expect demand to remain low but slightly recover from the pre-holiday dip or stabilize near the floor of previous performance (approx 130-150 range).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a baseline shift in early Spring (Periods 4-6) to around 215 units. However, there has been a significant and sustained downward trend over the last three periods (Periods 9-11), where demand dropped from 178 to 130 and finally 127 units. The current date (April 29) is past the peak spring shopping season and heading into a typically quieter period before summer retail transitions. The recent decline (avg of last two periods is ~128) suggests the previous baseline of 215 is no longer valid. I am forecasting a slight stabilization or continued low demand as the spring tailoring peak has passed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: baseline decreased from ~215 to ~128 (-40%) as the primary Spring peak for tailoring items recessed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The training data averaged 173 units. The test phase initially saw a peak (Avg: 236), stabilized around 215, then dropped significantly to ~128 starting Period 10. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: Period 12 (Apr 29) saw a spike to 191, likely driven by late-spring events (Mother's Day, graduations, or pre-summer social events) where women's tailoring is in high demand. Period 13 (May 6) is the peak week before Mother's Day and deep into the tailoring event season. (3) Recent trend analysis: While Periods 10-11 were low (~128), Period 12 showed a strong reversal (+50% increase), suggesting a temporary seasonal resurgence or 'secondary peak' for the month of May. (4) Final forecast logic: Taking the recent jump into account while acknowledging the lower baseline observed in mid-April, I expect the demand to remain elevated relative to the late-April dip but settle slightly as the initial surge of shoppers for May events balances out.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a distinct shift from the early Spring peak (averaging ~215 in March) to a lower, more volatile late-Spring baseline. A significant drop occurred starting Period 10 (avg ~128), but recent data (Periods 12-13) shows a partial recovery with demand averaging 175. Period 12 (191) likely benefited from end-of-month shopping or pre-holiday interest, while Period 13 (160) suggests a settling point. As it is now mid-May (Period 14), demand for tailored blazers typically stabilizes before the Summer clearance season begins. I anticipate demand will remain near the recent two-week average, slightly lower than Period 13 as the immediate post-payday/holiday peak from late April subsides.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a distinct rebound following the mid-April dip (Periods 10-11 avg: 128). Demand in the most recent three periods (P12-P14) has averaged 182 units, with Period 14 reaching 196. This recovery aligns with May's seasonal relevance for women's tailoring (blazers) often driven by spring events and professional wear. The forecast weights the recent upward momentum (P14: 196) and the stabilized 3-period average, predicting demand to remain strong near the 190 level.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery at Period 12: baseline increased from ~128 to ~182 (+42%) following a temporary mid-April dip, stabilizing near the original training average.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows significant variability. After a drop in mid-April (Periods 10-11), demand recovered to a new baseline (Periods 12-14: 191, 160, 196). However, the most recent observation (Period 15) saw a drop to 143 units. The current date (May 27) marks the transition from spring to early summer. Tailoring often sees a slight deceleration in late May before any summer clearance or secondary peaks. Given the volatility (196 to 143), but acknowledging the baseline established over the last month (Avg Period 12-15 = 172.5), I expect a slight stabilization. The forecast weights the recent drop while respecting the post-April recovery average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a sequence of distinct regimes: a Spring peak (Avg ~218), a sharp dip in late April (Avg ~128), and a subsequent recovery starting in Period 12. For the last five periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 171.6, which aligns closely with the original training average of 173.4. Recent demand (P14: 196, P15: 143, P16: 168) shows high variance but no clear directional trend, suggesting a stabilization at this baseline as we move into June. Given the product is a fitted blazer, early June stabilizes after the spring tailoring peak. Using a 3-period moving average (169) and a 5-period average (~172) as guides, the forecast targets the center of this stabilized range.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a transition from a high Spring baseline (~215) to a fluctuating recovery phase averaging approximately 163 units (P12-P17). Recent demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 118 units, coinciding with the beginning of June. As temperatures rise, demand for a lined 'woven fabric' blazer typically faces seasonal headwinds. While the recovery phase initially stabilized near the training average of 173, the current trend suggests a seasonal descent. The forecast anticipates a slight mean reversion from the low of 118 but maintains a lower baseline consistent with early summer cooling for tailoring, targeting a value around 135.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a cyclical nature typical of women's tailoring. After early spring peaks (avg ~215), the demand experienced a regime shift around Period 10, dropping to ~128 before recovering to a mid-range baseline (~182 during Periods 12-14). However, the most recent three periods (Period 16: 168, Period 17: 118, Period 18: 139) indicate a new downward trend. The current average for these last three weeks is ~142 units, a significant 22% drop from the mid-May average. As we move further into June (2019/6/17), demand for 'Dressed' woven blazers typically softens in favor of lighter summer wear. Given the recent cluster around the 140 mark and the preceding volatility, I expect demand to remain in this lower corridor.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: baseline decreased from ~182 to ~142 (-22%) as early summer seasonality reduces demand for structured woven tailoring.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a training average of 173. The product (Mariette Blazer) experienced a high-demand Spring season (avg ~215) followed by a peak-drop in April. More recently, as noted in the Carry-over Insights, a downward regime shift occurred at Period 17 (June 3rd) as the weather warmed, making heavy blazers less seasonally relevant. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized at a lower baseline: 118, 139, and 122 (average: 126). Given the date is late June (2019/6/24), we are in the middle of the summer lull for structured woven tailoring. The current trend suggests continued stability at this lower level.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer underwent several demand regimes, most recently shifting from a mid-spring average of ~170 to an early summer average of ~126 (Periods 17-19). Period 20 recorded a significant drop to 73 units. Calendar-wise, July 1st marks the height of the summer season, which is traditionally the weakest period for structured, woven tailoring as consumer interest shifts toward summer-weight apparel and vacationing. Given the sharp decline in Period 20 and the seasonal context, I anticipate demand will remain at this lower summer baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer has shown distinct seasonal shifts. After a strong spring performance (avg ~215), demand declined entering summer (avg ~142 in periods 17-19). The most recent observations (Periods 20 and 21) show a further drop and subsequent slight recovery (73 and 116 units), averaging 94.5 units over the last two weeks. This aligns with the peak summer lull for 'Dressed' tailoring items in July, as consumer focus shifts toward summer sales or lighter casual wear. Given the previous regime shift identified at Period 19 and the most recent data points, I expect demand to remain at this lower summer baseline. Period 21 showed a recovery from Period 20's low, so a forecast near the recent average of ~100 is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: baseline decreased from ~142 to ~100 (-30%) coinciding with the peak summer retail period for formal tailoring.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer has shown distinct regime shifts based on seasonality. After a spring peak and a mid-summer decline, the product entered a low-demand phase (the 'Peak Summer' regime) around Period 20. The most recent three periods (Periods 20, 21, and 22) recorded demands of 73, 116, and 120 respectively. While Period 20 was a significant outlier low, Periods 21 and 22 have clustered closely around an average of 118. As we remain in mid-July (2019/7/15), demand is expected to stay within this stabilized summer baseline before any potential late-summer or back-to-work recovery begins. Therefore, I am forecasting at this recent baseline level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following a dip in Period 20, demand has stabilized near ~118 units over the last two periods (Periods 21-22), confirming the new lower baseline for the peak summer period.

Predicted demand: 118 units

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of extreme stability following a mid-summer dip. After falling to 73 units in Period 20, demand recovered to 116 units and has subsequently remained at exactly 120 units for the last two consecutive weeks (Periods 22 and 23). This level aligns with the current seasonal insight that identified a established lower baseline of ~118 units for the peak summer retail period. As the current date (July 22) remains within this summer lull for tailored blazers and no calendar events or trend shifts suggest a deviation from this plateau, the forecast remains anchored to the recent stable level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer has shown significant seasonal declines as summer progresses. The carry-over insights established a summer baseline of approximately 100-118 units (Periods 21-23). However, Period 24 (July 22nd) saw a sharp drop to 63 units, which mirrors the volatile decline seen in Period 20 (73 units). Given the date is late July (2019/07/29), demand for structured, lined tailoring is at its seasonal nadir. Analysis of previous periods following a sharp drop suggests a partial mean reversion towards the recent summer baseline (~100), but tempered by the clear downward trend in the most recent observation. I expect demand to recover slightly from the floor of 63 but remain well below the previous 120-unit stability level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear decline during the summer months (June-July). The Carry-over insights noted a stabilization around ~118 units (Periods 21-23), but recent data (Periods 24-25) shows a further drop, with Period 24 at 63 and Period 25 at 94, averaging 78.5 units. As of August 5th (Period 26), we are at the tail end of the summer sale/clearance period. While tailoring demand typically begins to recover in late August for the 'Back to Office/School' season, the current trend is still significantly suppressed compared to the early summer baseline. Period 25 (94 units) shows a slight recovery from the Period 24 low (63 units), suggesting a mean reversion toward the stabilized summer low. I anticipate demand will remain in this lower range (80-100) before any significant autumn uptick occurs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer has shown several regime shifts corresponding to seasonal transitions. After reaching a peak in Spring, demand reached its lowest levels in late June and July (Period 24 at 63). However, the most recent three periods (24-26) show a clear upward trajectory (63 -> 94 -> 146). The current date is August 12, which aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' or 'Back-to-School' retail transition where interest in 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' categories typically recovers as consumers prepare for autumn work wardrobes. The demand in Period 26 (146) has surpassed the previous summer baseline of ~118 and is approaching the pre-summer levels seen in May (~143-168). I anticipate continued strength as the pre-fall season commences.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand increased from a summer low of ~99 (avg Periods 20-25) to 146 in Period 26, signaling the end of the summer low for tailoring products.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has entered a significant Autumn recovery phase. Following a summer low (avg ~99), demand rose to 146 in Period 26 and then spiked sharply to 301 in Period 27 (the week of Aug 12th). This spike aligns with the 'Back-to-Work' and early Autumn fashion season, where demand for structured tailoring typically surges. While 301 is a record high for the test phase, the momentum suggests a new high-demand regime for late August. Considering the jump was +106% from the previous week, a slight mean reversion is expected as the initial seasonal launch peak stabilizes, but the forecast remains well above previous baselines to account for the confirmed upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Significant Autumn surge at Period 27: Demand increased from 146 to 301 (+106%), marking a new seasonal peak for late August 'back-to-work' tailoring demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows strong seasonal sensitivity. Following a summer low (Periods 20-25 average ~98), we observed a sharp rise starting in Period 26 (146) and peaking in Period 27 (301), which corresponds to the mid-August 'back-to-work' and early Autumn fashion launch. Period 28 (251) shows demand remains high but is tapering off from the initial peak of the surge. The Current Date (Aug 26) marks the final week of August and the conclusion of the primary 'back-to-school/work' retail rush. Given the 16% drop from Period 27 to 28, I anticipate a further moderate decline as the initial seasonal inventory push stabilizes into a steady Autumn baseline, but I expect demand to remain well above the previous summer levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Mariette Blazer' is currently experiencing its Autumn 'back-to-work' seasonal peak. Following a massive surge in Period 27 (301 units, +106% from the prior week), demand has begun a gradual descent into a sustained Autumn baseline (251 in Period 28, 231 in Period 29). This pattern mirrors typical retail seasonality for tailoring where the initial rush of shopping for the new work/school season is slightly higher than the ongoing weekly demand that follows. Period 30 (2019/9/2) coincides with Labor Day in the US and the typical start of the business/school year in most regions. I expect demand to continue its stabilizing downward slope from the peak but remain significantly higher than the summer lows (~100 units). Based on the recent week-over-week decline rate of ~8%, a forecast of 215 is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn demand confirmed: Training period average of 173 and Summer low average of ~100 have been superseded by a new post-surge baseline averaging ~240 units over Periods 28-29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Autumn 'back-to-work' season. Following an initial surge in mid-August (301), demand stabilized around 240 units before jumping significantly in Period 30 (September 2) to 357 units. This spike likely reflects the primary September shopping peak for tailoring. Historical patterns suggest that mid-September demand remains elevated as corporate wardrobes are updated, although it may fluctuate slightly compared to the immediate post-holiday/first-of-month surge. Therefore, the forecast weights the strong recent momentum and the established higher Autumn baseline, targeting a level slightly below the recent peak but well above the previous 240 average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows a significant seasonal recovery starting in late August. Following the 'back-to-work' surge in Period 27 (301 units), demand transitioned to a higher baseline. Periods 30 and 31 show a further escalation (averaging 342.5 units), likely driven by the peak Autumn retail season for tailoring and 'dressed' categories as cooler weather sets in. The recent data (357 and 328) suggests a stabilization at this new elevated level. Given the current date of Sept 16, demand is expected to remain high before potential cooling in late Autumn. I will project a demand slightly lower than the Period 30 peak but consistent with the two-week average, anticipating continued strength in the Autumn tailoring market.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: baseline increased from ~240 to ~340 (+40%) as the Autumn peak for tailoring products intensified through early September.

Historical data shows a significant demand increase starting in early September (Period 30), establishing a new high-volume baseline for the Autumn season. The last three periods (30, 31, and 32) recorded demands of 357, 328, and 341 respectively, resulting in a three-week average of approximately 342 units. This indicates a stabilization at the elevated 'back-to-work' peak. As late September remains a high-demand period for women's blazers, I expect the demand to remain consistent with this recent average. No significant upward or downward trend is evident in the last three weeks, suggesting continued stability for Period 33.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant upward trend for the Mariette Blazer as the 'back-to-work' and Autumn season progresses. Demand shifted from a summer low (~100 units) to a late August baseline of ~240 (Period 27-29), then jumped to a higher regime of ~340 (Period 30-32). In Period 33 (2019/9/23), there was a massive spike to 612 units, likely driven by a specific promotion, pay-day weekend, or a major seasonal peak in tailoring demand. However, this 80% jump from the previous week is likely an outlier or a temporary peak rather than a sustainable new baseline. Analysis of similar retail cycles suggests demand will likely mean-revert toward the recently established high baseline but remain elevated due to seasonal momentum. I expect a correction from the 612 peak, settling slightly above the previous ~340 baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: A significant outlier spike to 612 units (+80% vs previous week) suggests a temporary seasonal peak or promotional event, potentially marking the zenith of the Autumn tailoring demand cycle.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows distinct seasonal peaks. We recently saw a massive surge in Period 33 (612 units), which was identified as a potential temporary peak or promotional zenith in the Autumn cycle. Period 34 (313 units) shows demand returning to the established September baseline (Periods 30-32 average ~342 units). As we move into October (Current Date: 2019/10/7), demand for lighter blazers often begins a gradual decline as consumers shift towards heavier outerwear for late Autumn/Winter. Given the return from the outlier spike and the transition into early October, I expect demand to remain slightly below the September peak levels but stable around the 300-310 mark.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer experienced a massive seasonal peak in Period 33 (612 units), which has since been followed by a steady decline as the initial Autumn 'back-to-work' rush subsides. Demand dropped from 313 in Period 34 to 283 in Period 35, showing a weekly contraction of approximately 30 units. As of October 14, we are moving further away from the late September tailoring peak. Given the current downward trajectory and the historical context of tailoring demand cooling in mid-October before any potential late-year surges, the forecast predicts a continued moderate decline toward the 250-unit level.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the Autumn peak for this blazer occurred between Periods 30 and 33, with a major spike in Period 33 (612 units). Since then, demand has entered a stabilization phase as the peak 'back-to-work' season transitions into late Autumn. In the last two periods (35 and 36), demand has leveled off significantly at 283 and 282 units respectively, which is approximately 17% below the September average of 342. Given the seasonal progression toward late October, a minor further decline or continued stabilization is expected as consumer interest begins to shift away from mid-weight blazers towards heavier outerwear. I am forecasting a slightly lower figure of 275, reflecting a gradual seasonal tapering from the recent stable plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows strong seasonality, with a significant Autumn surge that peaked in late September (Period 33). Following that peak, demand has stabilized into a secondary high-season baseline. Over the last three periods (35-37), demand has settled into a consistent range of 282 to 313 units, averaging approximately 293 units. This suggests the extreme volatility of the September 'back-to-work' period has subsided into a steady late-Autumn demand phase. The current date (2019/10/28) is just before the typical November retail lull that often precedes holiday shopping, but for structured tailoring like a blazer, demand usually remains stable through late October. Recent demand in Period 37 showed a slight uptick to 313, but the 3-period average remains the most reliable indicator of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Following the seasonal peak at Period 33, demand has stabilized at a new baseline of ~293 units (Periods 35-37), down from the ~340 unit baseline observed in early September.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern: a significant autumn peak spanning September and October, following a summer low. After a seasonal high of 612 units (Period 33), demand settled into a stable baseline of ~293 units (Periods 35-37). However, Period 38 (Oct 28) shows a notable uptick to 385 units (+24% over the recent average). As the date is November 4th, this increase likely signals the start of early holiday shopping or pre-Black Friday momentum, which typically drives demand for dressed/formal items like blazers. Given the strong performance in Period 38 and the seasonal context, I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly soften before the peak promotional weeks, settling near the 350-380 range.

Carry-over insight: Holiday build-up confirmed at Period 38: Demand increased from a stable baseline of ~293 to 385 units (+31%), indicating the start of the holiday/late-Autumn retail surge for dressed categories.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a recent holiday build-up at Period 38 (385 units) followed by a sharp correction in Period 39 (231 units). Looking at the calendar, Period 40 (2019/11/11) coincides with Singles' Day, a significant global promotional date. However, for a 'Dressed/Womens Tailoring' item like this blazer, demand often experiences a brief pre-holiday lull or 'wait-and-see' behavior from consumers as they anticipate major Thanksgiving/Black Friday promotions late in the month. The drop in Period 39 likely marks the end of the early November lift. I anticipate demand will find support near the previously established baseline of ~290-300 units seen in October, with a slight upward pressure from the November 11th date, though tempered by the upcoming Black Friday cycle.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a peak in late September (~612 units) followed by stabilization around 290 units in October. A 'Holiday build-up' was identified in Period 38 (385 units), followed by a sharp correction in Period 39 (231 units) and a moderate recovery in Period 40 (278 units). Current date (Nov 18) is the week preceding Black Friday week in 2019. Historically, demand for 'Dressed' categories like blazers begins to climb during this window as holiday social calendars fill up, though consumers may also delay purchases until the peak discount period. Given the 20% growth between Period 39 and 40, I expect a continued modest increase as the holiday shopping season accelerates.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant seasonal peak in September (Period 33: 612 units) followed by a stabilization around 300 units. Recent demand (Periods 39-41) has softened to an average of ~251 units, likely representing a pre-Black Friday lull as consumers deferred purchases. Period 42 (Nov 25 - Dec 1) coincides directly with Black Friday week (Nov 29). For a 'Dressed' apparel category like tailoring, this period typically experiences a massive demand spike comparable to or exceeding previous major promotional peaks. Given the previous peak in Period 33 reached 612 units from a base of ~340 (a 1.8x multiplier), and applying a similar or stronger retail event multiplier to the current base of ~251, I anticipate a significant surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2392.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' (a dressed tailoring item) experiences significant spikes during promotional and peak seasonal windows. Most recently, Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive surge to 733 units, coinciding with Black Friday week. Following major retail events, demand typically experiences a sharp contraction as the immediate promotional pull-forward effect dissipates. However, seasonality remains elevated in early December due to 'holiday party' demand for blazers. Comparing this to the previous surge in Period 33 (612 units) which dropped to 313 (-49%), a similar post-event correction is expected. From the 733 peak, a correction back toward the pre-spike baseline of ~250-300 units is likely, though buffered by holiday shopping.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday correction recorded at Period 43: A sharp decline from the peak of 733 units in Period 42 is expected, following historical patterns where major outliers (e.g., Period 33) revert to the established baseline (~250-280 units) immediately after the event.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU shows significant event-driven spikes followed by sharp corrections. Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw demand surge to 733 units, followed by a correction to 169 units in Period 43. This pattern mirrors Period 33 (612 units) which corrected to 313 units. Current date is Dec 9, entering the pre-Christmas shopping window. While Period 43 was a sharp post-event dip, demand for a 'Dressed' blazer typically sees a moderate recovery in mid-December for holiday parties and gifting. Based on the pre-Black Friday plateau (avg ~260) and the nature of the December retail cycle, I expect a partial recovery from the Period 43 low towards the established Autumn/Winter baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU shows significant sensitivity to seasonal retail events and major shopping periods. Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a peak of 733 units due to Black Friday, which was followed by a typical post-event correction in Period 43 (169 units). Period 44 (Dec 9) shows a recovery to 304 units, which aligns with the pre-Christmas holiday shopping surge. The current date (Dec 16) is the final full week of shopping before Christmas, which typically maintains high demand for 'Dressed' categories like blazers as consumers purchase outfits for holiday events. Comparing this to the post-autumn peak baseline of ~280-300 units, and observing the jump from 169 to 304, it is expected that demand will remain elevated or slightly increase before the end-of-year drop-off.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized around a baseline of 281 units over the last two weeks (P44: 304, P45: 258). However, the current period (P46) covers the week of December 23rd, which includes the Christmas holiday. For a 'Womens Tailoring' product like a fitted blazer, this period typically sees a significant reduction in demand as consumer focus shifts away from professional workwear and toward casual holiday attire or immediate gifting items. Comparing this to other periods of low commercial activity (such as the summer low of ~63-94 units in July or the mid-spring dip of ~127-130 units), a sharp seasonal contraction is expected. I anticipate demand will drop significantly below the recent baseline but likely stay above the absolute summer lows due to post-Christmas clearance activity starting December 26th.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a post-holiday lull. Following the significant Black Friday peak (733 units in Period 42) and a brief recovery in Periods 44-45 (avg ~281), demand dropped sharply in Period 46 (128 units), which coincided with Christmas week. Period 47 starts on December 30, encompassing New Year's Eve and the first days of January. Historically, tailoring items like blazers see a seasonal trough during the holiday week itself and into the first week of January before the early Spring retail season begins in February. While Period 46 likely hit the local floor due to Christmas closures and holiday focus, Period 47 is expected to remain low as consumer patterns shift from holiday dressing to year-end clearance and a general retail slowdown. A slight recovery from the Christmas trough towards the long-term training average (173) is projected as normal retail operations resume.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season trough confirmed at Period 46: Demand decreased from a post-Black Friday average of ~244 to 128 (-47%), marking the annual low for the dressed blazer category during the Christmas/New Year transition.

Predicted demand: 152 units
