Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for SKU 568601006, a women's blazer. The promised lead time is 0. Past demand data for the last 5 periods [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of 20.3. The date is early February, which is the beginning of the spring retail season for women's tailoring. Demand has been trending upwards over the last few periods (from 161 to 186). Given L=0, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for the current period (1+L). I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the current demand level, as the sample size is small but shows a clear upward trend. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer calculated from the recent volatility (sigma_hat with N=5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Women's Blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). Looking at the history, Period 1 demand was 227 units, which exceeded the initial order/arrival of 191, resulting in a stockout (sold 191, ending on-hand 0). The past demand data [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows a mean of 173.4. However, Period 1's demand of 227 indicates a potential upward trend or seasonality as we move further into February (spring transition for tailoring). Since the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (ordered P1, arrived P1), I will use an explicit forecast to ensure we cover the recent high demand and avoid another stockout. I'll set mu_hat based on the most recent demand (227) and use the standard deviation of all samples (including the recent spike) to capture volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring piece. We are currently in late February. Demand has shown a significant step-up from the pre-game history (avg ~173) to the current periods (P1: 227, P2: 284). Both periods 1 and 2 ended with zero inventory, meaning we are under-ordering relative to actual demand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (same-period arrival). Since demand is increasing (likely due to spring professional wear seasonality), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the higher recent demand trend. I'll set a high mu_hat via explicit value based on the latest demand (284) to prevent further stockouts, as Profit ($4) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1), favoring a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: average demand increased from ~173 to ~255 (+47%), with a further peak at 284 in Period 2. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $648.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a Women's Blazer (Mariette Blazer). Since the current date is early March (2019/3/4), we are in the peak spring retail season for women's tailoring. Recent demand across the first three periods has been 227, 284, and 198 (average ~236), which is significantly higher than the historical pre-period average of 173. The drop to 198 in Period 3 suggests the initial peak might be stabilizing, but demand remains elevated compared to the long-term history. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the recent volatility and higher volume needed for the spring season. On-hand inventory is 144, which is below the current average demand, requiring a restock.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is currently in a high-demand regime compared to the pre-game history. Since Period 1, observed demand has been [227, 284, 198, 214], averaging ~231. This is a significant jump from the earlier 'Past demands' average of 173. The date (March) aligns with early Spring/pre-Easter seasonality for women's tailoring. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended Period 4 at 60 units. Given the lead time is 0, the (L+1) horizon is 1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new 'active season' demand level (mean ~231) while smoothing the volatility seen in Period 2 (284). The OR backend will calculate the base stock for L=0 based on these recent 4 periods and subtract the 60 units on hand to determine the Period 5 order.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its early spring season (mid-March). Observed demand in the last five periods has been [227, 284, 198, 214, 215], showing a stabilized higher regime compared to the pre-game data [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. The mean demand since Period 1 is ~227.6. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in historical conclude messages. Given the steady demand over the last three periods (P3-P5 mean: 209), I am using N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent regime shift while smoothing out the early-cycle volatility of P1-P2. This will ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the current 200+ units/period demand levels as we head deeper into the spring season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~210-230 units/period since Period 1, significantly higher (+25%) than pre-game history. Lead time consistently 0 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) has shown a stable demand regime over the last four periods (Periods 3-6) with an average of 210.5 units (198, 214, 215, 215). This is significantly higher than the initial pre-game average (~170) but has leveled off from the initial spikes in Periods 1 and 2. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To optimize for the Period 7 decision (March 25th), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this current stable mean of ~211 units and its associated volatility. This period (March 25) precedes typical spring retail peaks, making the maintenance of a consistent stock level based on recent history appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs while meeting the current ~210-215 unit demand level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its spring season. Current demand observations from Period 1 to Period 7 average approximately 220 units per period (227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186), which is significantly higher than the pre-game average of 173. The last 5 periods (P3-P7) show a stabilized demand average of 205.6. Lead time is reliably 0 periods as confirmed by all 7 periods of game history. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized post-peak demand level, and use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility of the entire active selling period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand regime while accounting for the zero lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer) in early April. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a stable higher regime compared to pre-game data, with an average of approximately 223 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 8) was 249, suggesting a potential spring uptick as we move into April. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To ensure we meet demand and capture the current upward trend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods of the active game history (N=8) to reflect the stabilized higher demand level. I will use the same window for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility. The default lead time setup is appropriate as L=0 is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring). Current date is April 15, which is mid-spring, typically a stable period for tailoring demand. Analysis of history from Period 1 to 9 shows a mean demand of approximately 218 units. While demand peaked at 284 (P2) and dipped to 178 (P9) and 186 (P7), it generally oscillates around the 210-230 range mentioned in the Carry-over Insights. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since Period 1, ignoring the lower pre-game history averages. This allows the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for a (1+L) = 1 period horizon using the current demand distribution while maintaining high service levels (75-80% based on the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost ratio). Current on-hand is 72, which is low compared to the expected demand of ~220, necessitating a fresh order.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has shown a significant demand drop in Period 10 (130 units), likely indicating the start of a post-Easter/spring decline or a shift in regime as we head deeper into Q2. The average demand for the last 10 periods is approximately 210 units, but the last two periods (178 and 130) suggest a downward trend. lead_time is consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock to avoid stockouts if the drop was just volatility. This N=5 window captures the period from P6 to P10, covering both the stable elevated demand and the recent dip, resulting in an average demand of approximately 172 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Demand decreased significantly to 130 units from a previous average of ~210, potentially signaling the end of the spring seasonal peak for tailored blazers.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring) has entered a lower demand regime as expected for late April/May. Demand in Period 10 (130) and Period 11 (127) confirms a significant drop from the previous average of ~210. This aligns with the end of the peak spring office-wear season. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this declining demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This captures the two low periods (P10, P11) and one higher period (P9), providing a conservative transition to the lower target level while maintaining responsiveness to the new demand level of ~130 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Ave demand dropped from ~210 to ~128 (-39%) over the last 2 periods (Date: late April), signaling a post-peak seasonal shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand spiked unexpectedly to 191 units despite the recent downward trend (130, 127 in Periods 10-11). This spike combined with a conservative order from Period 12 (68 units) resulted in a stockout (sold 170 units with 0 ending inventory). Historically, demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' has been volatile, ranging from 127 to 284. Given the date (May 6), we are currently in a transition period after the initial spring tailoring peak. The last 3 periods (P10-P12) averaged 149 units, but the sudden jump to 191 suggests demand hasn't fully bottomed out. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat [ (130+127+191)/3 = 149 ] to capture the lower regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to account for the increased variance shown by the Period 12 jump. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-peak spring season for the Mariette Blazer (Date: May 13). Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the pre-Easter peak. In Period 12, there was a brief spike (demand=191), but Period 13 returned to a lower level (demand=160). The demand regime over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has averaged 152 units (130, 127, 191, 160). Given the product type (woven blazer/fitted jacket), we expect demand to remain steady or slightly decline as summer approaches. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower post-peak demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-Period 10 demand (avg ~210) is no longer representative.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak (starting P10): average demand ~152 units, compared to the spring peak average of ~210 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase (May), with demand showing significant volatility. In Period 14 (late May), demand spiked to 196, causing a stockout (sold 178 of 178 starting inventory) even though the average demand since the P10 shift was approximately 152. This follows a previous stockout in P12 (demand 191). The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lower average demand compared to the spring peak, I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods (P10-P14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the lower mean of the current regime (~160) but incorporates the volatility seen in the recent spikes (191 and 196). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has transitioned from its spring peak into a more stable but lower demand regime. Since Period 10, the demand has averaged approximately 158 units (130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143), which aligns with the post-peak stabilization context identified in the Carry-over Insights. The seasonality for women's tailored blazers typically cools in late May. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (the 'arrived' units in history match the 'ordered' units of the same period). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this post-peak regime (Periods 10-15). This choice of N captures the full period since the significant downward shift in mid-April. On-hand inventory is 46, and since L=0, the target base stock reflects demand for the current period only. Given the relatively high service level requirement (profit/holding ratio of 4:1), maintaining a sigma based on the same recent window is appropriate to provide a buffer against the variation seen in this secondary regime (\u03c3 \u2248 28 for these periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a post-spring peak demand regime. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the February-April peak. Over the last 7 periods (P10-P16), the average demand is approximately 159 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, ensuring same-period fulfillment. Given the date (early June), we are entering the summer season where tailoring might experience lower or more volatile demand. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-peak demand (Periods 10-16). This N captures the current regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (starting P10) while providing enough variance data to maintain an appropriate service level. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P10-P16) is stable with an average of ~159 units, down from the spring peak average of ~210 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's tailored blazer. Historical demand since Period 10 (mid-April) shows that the spring seasonal peak (avg ~210) has subsided, settling into a lower early-summer regime. Demand over the last 8 periods (P10-P17) averages approximately 154 units per period [130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143, 168, 118]. The most recent demand (P17) was 118, the lowest in the series, but given the volatility in this post-peak regime (standard deviation ~28), I will base parameters on the full post-peak window (N=8). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on all previous arrivals. On-hand inventory is 65. The OR backend will use these values to target a base stock covering the current period's demand with an 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/6/17, moving further into the summer season. The Mariette Blazer demand has stabilized into a post-spring peak regime (starting around Period 10). Analysis of the most recent 9 periods (P10-P18) shows a mean demand of approximately 152.4 units, which is significantly lower than the early spring peak. The most recent demand (P18) was 139, confirming this lower stabilization. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on this sustained shift in demand magnitude, I am using a recent_N strategy with N=9 to capture this mature-season demand level and its associated volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that reflects the current 150-160 unit demand range rather than the higher 200+ unit spring peak history, thereby minimizing excess holding costs as the season progresses.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a Women's Blazer. We are currently in a post-peak seasonal regime that began around Period 10 (late April). Looking at the demand from Period 10 to Period 19, the demand values are [130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143, 168, 118, 139, 122]. The average demand over these last 10 periods is 149.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 27.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory (on-hand is 55, in-transit is 0). I will set N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-peak demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock based on the current lower demand level while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered Period 21 (July 1st). Reviewing the demand history following the stabilization noted in Period 17 (average ~159 units for P10-P16), there has been a significant and sustained downward trend over the last four periods (P17-P20): demands were 118, 139, 122, and 73. This downward drift, culminating in a low of 73 units, likely reflects the transition into mid-summer where demand for tailored blazer jackets typically troughs before autumn collections arrive. The average demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 113 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent downward movement for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for highly responsive inventory adjustments. Current on-hand is 101 units, which is already sufficient to cover the most recent observed demand (73), so the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to minimize holding costs while the demand is in this low phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: demand has trended downward from a post-spring average of ~159 to a recent 4-period average of ~113 units (P17-P20), reaching a low of 73 units in Period 20, signaling mid-summer seasonality.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a mid-summer demand decline. The current date is July 8, 2019. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged approximately 113.6 units (118, 139, 122, 73, 116), down from the post-spring average of ~160 units. Period 20's low of 73 units followed by Period 21's 116 units suggests volatility at a lower base. I will use N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent downward-trending regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. This approach helps the OR backend scale down the base stock to avoid excessive holding costs as summer demand wanes for this structured blazer.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P21) confirmed at an average of ~114 units, a 28% decrease from the late-spring average of ~159.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a mid-summer seasonal trough. Historical data shows a clear shift starting Period 17, with demand dropping from a spring average of ~210 to a post-peak average of ~159, and then further down to a recent 6-period average (P17-P22) of ~114 units. The most recent demand (P21: 116, P22: 120) confirms stabilization around this lower level. I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this mid-summer regime (P17-P22). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by all history up to Period 22. Given the high criticality of stockouts in this game (profit $4 vs $1 holding cost), the recent_N method based on the current regime will ensure the base stock is responsive to the current lower demand while maintaining a buffer against the observed volatility (range: 73-139).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a mid-summer demand regime. Historically, blazers see lower demand during the warmest months (July). Since Period 17, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 113-115 units. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show remarkably consistent demand of 116, 120, and 120 units respectively, averaging ~119 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the stability of this mid-summer regime (starting around P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~115-120 units while maintaining a small safety buffer for the low volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P23) is highly stable, with the last 3 periods showing demand consistently around 116-120 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a mid-summer low, with a significant drop to 63 units in Period 24. While the average for the period P17-P23 was approximately 115 units, the most recent observation suggests a potential further deceleration or high volatility during the late July period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the current on-hand inventory of 70 units already exceeds the most recent demand of 63, and the mid-summer demand regime (P17-P24) averages approximately 109 units with a downward trend, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P17-P24) to capture this lower summer baseline. This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock to reflect the reduced demand while maintaining a buffer for potential recovery as we approach the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (starting P17) has trended lower, with Period 24 seeing a significant drop to 63 units, bringing the regime average down to ~109 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a mid-to-late summer demand regime (starting around Period 17). Recent demand (P17-P25) has averaged ~105 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen even lower volatility and a slightly lower mean of ~103 units. Specifically, Period 24 saw a dip to 63 units, but Period 25 recovered to 94. Given we are in early August (2019/8/5), we are approaching the 'Back to School' or 'Early Autumn' transition for tailored blazers, where demand often picks up after the summer lull. To capture this stabilization while acknowledging the recent lower average, I will use a recent_N of 9 (filtering back to the start of the current summer regime at P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced baseline of ~105 units. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered August, typically a back-to-school and pre-fall transition period for tailoring. Demand in Period 26 spiked to 146 units, the highest in 12 periods, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests the 'mid-summer' low is ending and a seasonal upward shift is beginning. The mid-summer regime (starting Period 17) averaged ~105 units, but the most recent 3 periods show a recovery trend (63, 94, 146). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this upward movement (average ~101), but use an explicit mu_hat slightly higher than the N=3 mean to account for the stockout in Period 26 (where demand of 146 was restricted by stock) and to prepare for further August growth. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 26: demand increased to 146 (+55% vs prev 5-period avg), signaling the end of the mid-summer low and the start of pre-fall tailoring demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant demand surge (301 units in Period 27), clearly signaling the start of the pre-fall/autumn tailoring season. This follows a period of stable mid-summer demand (avg ~110). Historical data suggests a new regime starting at Period 26. Since Period 27 demand (301) was double the previous week (146), I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using the most recent 2-period data (P26-P27) to capture this rapid upward trend. Using N=2 is justified by the clear seasonal shift and the urgency to prevent stockouts, as we have hit zero inventory for two consecutive weeks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Pre-fall tailoring season started with demand jumping to 146 (P26) and 301 (P27), significantly exceeding the mid-summer average of ~110.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has entered the pre-fall tailoring season, showing a significant jump starting in Period 26. Historical demands for the last three periods are 146, 301, and 251. This represents a clear regime shift compared to the mid-summer low (avg ~110). Given the date (late August), we expect this higher demand to persist as consumers prepare for autumn. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To capture this new, high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the current volatility (demand dropped from 301 to 251), I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR engine on the most recent seasonal behavior (avg ~232 units per period) and ensures the base stock is high enough to avoid stockouts observed in Periods 26 and 27.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall seasonality confirmed: Period 26-28 average demand is ~233 units, a significant increase from the mid-summer average of ~110 units (+112%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a strong pre-fall seasonal surge that began in Period 26. Historical demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 146, 301, 251, and 231, yielding a recent average of approximately 232 units. This is a 110% increase compared to the mid-summer low (avg ~110). Analysis of the last three periods specifically (P27-P29) shows a stabilized high-demand regime around 261 units. Given the transition into September, which is peak season for tailoring and workwear, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this established shift while accounting for the high volatility seen in P27. Sigma_hat is also set to reflect this recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall tailoring season shift confirmed: Period 26-29 average demand is ~232 units, a significant and sustained increase from the mid-summer average of ~110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1148.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' is currently in a pre-fall tailoring peak. Demand in Period 30 spiked to 357 units, and we stocked out. The current demand regime (Periods 26-30) shows a mean of 257.2 units and a high standard deviation (approx 78). Calendar context (September 9th) suggests we are squarely in the back-to-work/school season where tailoring demand remains high. Given the volatility and the recent stock-out, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this heightened seasonal average (approx 257 per period). Since the recent spike (357) suggests higher variability than the start of the regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall peak demand confirmed: Period 26-30 average demand is ~257 units, a significant increase from the mid-summer low of ~110. Demand reached a season high of 357 in P30.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of a high-demand pre-fall tailoring season (Sept 16). Demand has surged since Period 26, with the last five periods (P27-P31) showing demands of 301, 251, 231, 357, and 328. This averages approximately 294 units per period. The inventory is currently at 0 due to demand (328) exceeding both on-hand and recent arrivals. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime (avg ~294). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall peak demand regime confirmed (P27-P31): average demand has stabilized at a much higher level (~294 units) compared to the initial pre-fall transition in P26.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a sustained high-demand pre-fall peak. Demand in the last five periods (P28-P32) has been [251, 231, 357, 328, 341], averaging ~302 units. This represents a distinct stabilization at a higher level than the initial transition period (P26-P27). Stockouts occurred in four of the last six periods (P26, P27, P30, P31, P32), indicating the OR backend's default parameters and caps are consistently underestimating the potential for high-side demand variance. To capture this peak and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (P27-P32), which covers the core of the high-demand regime. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Using recent_N for sigma_hat specifically will allow the OR backend to calculate a wider safety buffer based on the recent high volatility observed during these peak weeks.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall high-demand regime stabilized further (P27-P32): average demand increased to ~302 units, compared to the initial transition average of ~232 units. Significant supply pressure is evidenced by repeated stockouts.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has experienced a massive surge in Period 33, reaching 612 units, which is nearly double the average of the previous 'high-demand' regime (P27-P32 avg ~302). This spike likely corresponds to the peak of the fall tailoring/back-to-office season (late September). The inventory was completely wiped out, resulting in significant lost sales. To respond to this extreme shift, I am moving to an 'explicit' forecast for Period 34. Given the massive jump from 341 to 612, a conservative yet responsive forecast for the next period is approximately 550 units (accounting for a potential slight cooling from the absolute peak but acknowledging the new baseline). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=7 to cover the high-demand period) to reflect the significantly increased volatility associated with these higher volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand spiked to 612 units, nearly double the previous high-demand average of ~302, signaling a peak-season surge for women's tailoring in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer (Womens Tailoring) is currently in a highly volatile peak season. After a massive spike to 612 units in Period 33 (late September), demand in Period 34 (September 30) pulled back to 313 units. This suggests the 612 was a significant outlier or a very narrow peak, while the underlying 'high season' average remains elevated compared to the pre-fall transition. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system targets high service levels. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (P31-P34 average ~398 units) while moderating the extreme outlier from P33. This balances the risk of another spike with the 344 units already on-hand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: High-demand regime (P31-P34) shows significant volatility with a peak of 612 (P33) followed by a moderation to 313 (P34); regime average is ~398 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand pre-fall/early-autumn regime. After a massive spike of 612 units in Period 33 (late September), demand has moderated but remains high and volatile, with Period 34 at 313 and Period 35 at 283 units. The current regime starting from the pre-fall transition (Period 26) shows an average demand of approximately 311 units. However, looking at the peak-intensity window (Period 30-35), the average is higher at ~372 units with significant variance (std dev ~120). Given the date (Oct 14) and the product type (Blazer), we are likely moving out of the peak transition phase into a steady high-demand autumn period. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6, from Period 30 to 35) to capture this high-demand behavior for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is confirmed as 0. The current on-hand inventory is 236 units, which is slightly below the recent average demand, necessitating a moderate order to maintain the service level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime (P30-P35) confirmed higher and more volatile: average demand ~372 units, compared to early pre-fall average (P26-P29) of ~232 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $936.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in its mid-autumn demand phase (October). After the massive spike in Period 33 (612 units), demand has moderated and stabilized over the last three periods (P34-P36) at 313, 283, and 282 units respectively, with an average of 293 units. This suggests the peak-season surge has leveled off into a consistent high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 192 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering as the season progresses, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 (capturing the moderation since the P33 surge: 612, 313, 283, 282). This balances the high mean with the recent downward stabilization. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to account for the high volatility introduced by the 612 peak, which ensures a sufficient safety stock to maintain service levels during this active retail period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand stabilized post-peak (P34-P36): demand moderated from a peak of 612 (P33) to a steady range of ~280-310 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized in a mid-autumn regime (P34-P37) following the significant peak in Period 33. Over the last four periods, demand has been remarkably consistent, ranging between 282 and 313 units, with an average of 297.75 units. This follows a period of high volatility but suggests a settled plateau for the current season. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on this stability, I am using recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-peak behavior while ignoring the outlier spike of 612 units in Period 33. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 195 units, and these parameters will ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the ~300 unit average demand with an appropriate safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand plateau confirmed (P34-P37): average demand has stabilized at ~298 units, reflecting a post-peak seasonal steady state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1252.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its mid-autumn demand phase (Date: Nov 4). Following a period of relative stability (approx. 300 units), demand spiked in Period 38 to 385 units, leading to a stockout. This timing corresponds with the shift into colder weather and potentially early holiday shopping preparations. The demand average over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 315 units, but the last period shows upward momentum. Given the stockout in P38, true demand may have been even higher than observed. Lead time is reliably 0 periods. To ensure high service levels while respecting the recent volatility (ranging from 282 to 385 in the last 4 periods, excluding the 612 outlier), I will use the recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime (post-spike) while smoothing the recent 385 demand vs. the previous ~300 plateau. This approach will set a base stock that covers the expected demand and historical variance within this autumn window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand increased to 385 units from a stable ~300 average (+28%), resulting in a stockout and signaling late-autumn/early-winter peak momentum.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/11. Demand is exhibiting notable volatility as we move into the late autumn/winter season. Period 38 saw a spike to 385, while Period 39 moderated to 231. The average demand for the 'Mid-Autumn' period (P34-P39) is approximately 301 units, which aligns with the previous plateau mentioned in Period 38 insights. Given the periodic spikes (P33 at 612, P38 at 385), I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture this higher volatility and mean level. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. A service level approach is maintained to capture potential spikes while managing holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the year (Period 40 of 47).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is at Period 41 (mid-November), historically a time for late-autumn/early-winter demand in women's tailoring. The recent demand regime (P38-P40) has been somewhat volatile with a spike to 385 followed by 231 and 278, averaging ~298 units. This is very close to the mid-autumn plateau average identified in Period 38. There is no evidence of a significant new shift yet, though the stockout in P38 suggests we should maintain a protective inventory level. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the most recent fluctuations (P37-P40) into the forecast, as demand seems to be oscillating around the 300-unit mark. This N captures the stable period plus the recent peak, providing a balanced base stock for the current trend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its late-autumn/winter phase (Nov 25th). Since Period 38, the demand has entered a new regime, moderating from the October peak but remaining significantly higher than mid-summer levels. Following the spike in Period 38 (385), demand in the last three periods (P39-P41) has averaged 251 units (231, 278, 245). This represents a shift from the previous 'Mid-autumn plateau' of ~300. Given the stable demand over these three weeks as we enter late November, I am setting N=3 to capture this recent behavior. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend needs to maintain a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), and recent_N will provide the most accurate mean and volatility estimates for this stable late-season period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: post-autumn peak demand has stabilized at an average of ~251 units (P39-P41), down from the previous ~300 average (-16%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked dramatically to 733 units, far exceeding the recent average of ~251 units and our previous seasonal peak of 612. This likely represents a Black Friday or cyber week surge for womens tailoring. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given we are in early December (Period 43), demand may remain elevated for holiday shopping but will likely taper off from the extreme Black Friday peak. I will use a 4-period average (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the surge, while setting sigma_hat to 'explicit' to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 231 to 733). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Black Friday surge detected with demand jumping to 733 units from a previous 3-period average of ~251 (+192%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand surged to 733 units. In Period 43, demand dropped to 169 units as the peak subsided. We are now at Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the post-Cyber Monday/mid-December period. Historically, after large promotional spikes like Black Friday, demand for blazers typically moderates before a potential end-of-year clearance or holiday event. The current on-hand inventory is 414 units. Given that the mean demand for the 3 periods preceding Black Friday was ~251 units and the post-surge demand was 169, I expect demand to stabilize around the 200-250 unit range. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (including the surge and the correction) captures this volatility while centering on a more sustainable level. L remains 0. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying slightly higher stock levels to avoid lost sales during remaining holiday weeks.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge (P42) confirmed at 733 units, followed by a sharp correction to 169 units in P43, marking the end of the late-autumn promotional peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (ending Dec 9), demand was 304 units, following a Post-Black Friday low of 169. This suggests demand is stabilizing back to a mid-winter level of approximately 250-300 units, similar to the pre-Black Friday plateau (P39-P41 avg ~251). We are currently in mid-December (P45, Dec 16), approaching the holiday period. Given the recent volatile demand (733, 169, 304), a standard average might be skewed. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-promo behavior (Avg last 3: 402 units, reflecting the extreme volatility) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the high variance induced by the Black Friday peak and its subsequent correction. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand correction: Demand recovered to 304 units (P44) from a low of 169 (P43), indicating a return to a steady mid-winter state of ~250-300 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, just before Christmas. Historically, demand has stabilized following the Black Friday surge (P42: 733 units) and subsequent correction (P43: 169 units), with the most recent two periods (P44-P45) averaging ~281 units. This aligns with a steady mid-winter demand state for women's tailoring. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To capture the current stabilized demand regime while acknowledging the recent high-volatility peak, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (P43-P45) to reflect the post-surge average (~244 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 3 to account for current volatility levels. These parameters ensure the base stock is tuned to the current 'steady' state minus the extreme outlier of Black Friday.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30th (Period 47). We are in the post-holiday/end-of-year period. Following the Black Friday surge (P42: 733) and subsequent correction (P43: 169), demand has stabilized somewhat (P44: 304, P45: 258). However, Period 46 shows a significant drop to 128 units, which likely reflects the typical post-Christmas decline for women's tailoring (fitted jackets) as the winter formal/business season winds down before any spring transition. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 46 is the first signal of a deep post-holiday drop, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (P44-P46) to capture the trend while being cautious not to over-react to a single low point, as demand usually settles around 200-250 in non-peak winter. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 (P42-P46) to incorporate the higher volatility seen during and after the late-year peaks. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high service level (80% target) against the holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline detected at Period 46: demand dropped to 128 units from a 2-period average of ~281 (-54%), signaling the end of the winter peak season for women's blazers.
