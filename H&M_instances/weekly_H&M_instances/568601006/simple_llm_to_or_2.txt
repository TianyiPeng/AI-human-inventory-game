SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', categorized under 'Womens Tailoring / Dressed', which is typically a staple professional item. Historical demand over the last five periods shows a generally stable but slightly increasing trend (161, 145, 179, 196, 186), with a 5-period average of 173.4. Given the current date is February 11th, we are entering the spring transition period for retail, where professional/office wear like blazers often see a seasonal uptick as consumers update their wardrobes for the new season. The last two demand figures (196, 186) suggest a higher baseline compared to the start of the training set. I will forecast a value that aligns with this recent elevated level while accounting for the seasonal transition into spring tailoring.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Analysis: The training data (Periods -4 to 0) shows a range of 145-196 units with an average of 173.4. 2. Current Context: Period 1 (2019-02-11) showed a significant jump to 227 units, which is 15.8% higher than the previous high. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: February is the start of the Spring/Summer fashion season. The 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed) is a typical professional or event-wear staple that often sees increased demand as people refresh work wardrobes for spring. 4. Trend: The jump from 186 to 227 indicates a potential regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. Given we are in mid-February, I expect demand to remain elevated near this new level as spring shopping continues.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data for this blazer showed a stable range between 145-196 units. 2. Observed Demand: Period 1 (227) and Period 2 (284) show a significant and accelerating upward shift compared to the training data. 3. Seasonal Relevance: As of late February (2019/2/25), dressed items like blazers typically see increased demand as consumers transition to spring workwear and event wardrobes. 4. Trend Analysis: The move from 227 to 284 represents a 25% week-over-week increase. Given the start of the spring retail season, this upward momentum is expected to continue or stabilize at a higher level than the early February baseline.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand regime shift confirmed: demand increased from training avg (~173) to test avg (~255), a ~47% increase coinciding with the spring transition.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is a professional/dressed garment highly relevant for the spring transition. Historical training demand averaged ~173. In the test phase, Period 1 (227) and Period 2 (284) showed a significant jump, likely due to pre-spring shopping. Period 3 (198) shows a slight cooling or normalization, though it remains notably higher than the training average. As we enter early March (Period 4), we are in the peak period for women's spring tailoring. The downward move in Period 3 (198) suggests the initial 'bulk' buy of the new season has passed, but the base demand level has shifted upwards. Based on the 3-period test average (approx. 236), I expect demand to stabilize between the high of Period 2 and the lull of Period 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173. The test phase (P1-P4) shows a clear regime shift to a higher demand level, averaging ~231. Period 2 saw a significant peak (284), while P3 and P4 stabilized closer to the lower boundary of this new regime (198-214). As we move further into March (current date 2019/3/11), demand for a 'Mariette Blazer' (spring workwear/tailoring) is expected to build momentum or sustain current levels due to seasonal transition. I predict demand will slightly increase from the previous week's 214 to reach a level closer to the test phase average.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an average demand of 173. Entering the test phase (Periods 1-5), the demand increased significantly, averaging 227.6 units, supporting the previous carry-over insight of an upward regime shift (~31% increase over training). However, looking at the most recent three weeks (Periods 3, 4, and 5), demand has stabilized and flattened out significantly, recording 198, 214, and 215 units respectively (mean of 209). As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's tailoring/Dressed), the product is highly relevant for the spring season and office wear. Given the date (March 18), we are in a peak period for spring fashion. The demand has shown high stability over the last two weeks with almost no variance (214 to 215); I expect this stability to continue with a slight upward pressure as we move further into the spring season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a significant upward shift from the training average (~173) at the start of the test phase, peaking in Period 2 (284). Since then, demand has undergone a correction and entered a highly stable phase. For the last three periods (4, 5, and 6), demand has remained almost constant at 214-215 units. Given the transition into late March, which is peak season for spring tailoring like the Mariette Blazer, demand is expected to maintain this stable plateau. The forecast assumes the current trend of 215 units will continue into Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following the initial spring launch peak, demand has settled into a consistent regime averaging 215 units over the last three periods (Periods 4-6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed an initial spring launch peak (Periods 1-2), followed by a stabilization period (Periods 4-6) at 215 units. Period 7 (March 25th) shows a notable drop to 186 units (-13.5% from the previous mean). Period 8 (April 1st) starts a new month and typically aligns with increased spring shopping as weather warms; however, the dip in Period 7 suggests the 'initial launch' momentum has faded. While April often sees retail growth, the recent drop in Period 7 is the most relevant signal. I expect demand to remain below the 215-unit stabilization level but potentially recover slightly from the Period 7 dip as the core spring season begins. Therefore, I am forecasting a slight recovery towards the previous mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173. The test phase showed an initial surge followed by a stabilization period (P4-P6) around 215 units. After a dip in Period 7 (186), demand spiked significantly in Period 8 (249). As we move deeper into April (peak Spring season for 'Dressed' products like blazers), demand is expected to remain high. The Period 8 spike likely reflects seasonal demand for workwear and spring events. The forecast assumes demand will maintain this elevated level, slightly moderating from the immediate spike but staying above the previous stabilization level of 215.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. During the test phase, Period 1-3 saw a high-demand regime (~236 avg) which then stabilized from Period 4-6 at 215 units. Recent volatility has increased: Period 7 (186), Period 8 (249), and Period 9 (178). This volatility is likely seasonal; the current date (April 15th) marks the peak of the spring retail season for women's tailoring/blazers. Period 8's spike to 249 suggests a possible pre-Easter or mid-season promotion/event, followed by a correction in Period 9. Given the stabilization average of 215 and the high-demand seasonality of April for professional/event wear, I expect demand to mean-revert toward the recent established level while accounting for the downward pull of the most recent observation.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an average demand of ~173. In the test phase, demand initially spiked with the spring transition (Weeks 1-6 averaging ~225), but recent weeks show a significant cooling trend. Period 10 (Apr 15) dropped to its lowest recorded level of 130 units. The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, typically used for formal or office wear. The current date (April 22) follows the major shopping period of Easter (April 21, 2019), which often results in a post-holiday demand dip as consumer spending slows. Given the sharp decline from 249 in Period 8 to 178 in Period 9 and 130 in Period 10, the trend is strongly downward. I expect demand to stabilize slightly above the recent low but remain well below the mid-spring average as the season matures.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift: Starting Period 9, demand has significantly declined, dropping from a previous stabilization of ~215 to a recent 3-period average of 185, with a specific sharp drop to 130 in Period 10.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a spring peak (Periods 1-6 avg: ~225) followed by a notable decline. In the most recent three periods (9, 10, 11), demand has dropped significantly to 178, 130, and 127 respectively. The current date (2019/4/29) follows the Easter peak and moves deeper into mid-spring, where demand for heavy tailored blazers typically softens as consumers transition to lighter summer garments. The last two periods show stability at a lower level (~128). I expect demand to remain near this current floor as the downward trend observed in Period 11 stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 12: Demand has transitioned from a stabilization level of ~215 to a new lower plateau, with the last three periods (Period 9-11) averaging 145, representing a ~32% decrease as the peak tailoring season ends.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer peaked in February/March (Avg ~225) and entered a downward regime in April (Avg ~156). However, the most recent observation (Period 12) shows a significant rebound to 191 units. This recovery likely reflects a pre-holiday boost associated with early May events (e.g., Mother's Day, early summer social season) or normalized demand after the sharp dips in mid-April. Given the current date is May 6, the demand is expected to remain slightly elevated compared to the April lows but stay below the early spring peak as the product life-cycle moves further into the season. I anticipate a stabilization around the 180-185 range.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer showed an initial spring peak (Feb/Mar) followed by a notable cooling period in April. Specifically, a downward regime shift was identified in late April (Periods 10/11 averaging ~128). However, Period 12 saw a spike to 191 (May Day/early May shopping) before softening again to 160 in Period 13. Given the current date of May 13, we are entering the mid-May seasonal period. The product is a 'Dressed/Womens Tailoring' blazer, which often sees moderate demand for spring events (graduations, weddings). The recent 2-period average (Periods 12-13) is 175.5. Given the previous trend of decline from the spring peak but the periodic May recovery, a slight downward adjustment from the last period is expected as the initial May surge subsides, targeting a level consistent with the new lower stabilization regime (~150-160 range).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a spring peak (Periods 1-8 avg: ~224) followed by a confirmed downward shift as the peak tailoring season ended (Periods 9-11 avg: ~145). However, the most recent three periods (Periods 12-14) show a recovery and stabilization at a higher level (191, 160, 196) with an average of 182 units. The current date (May 20) is late spring, where demand for blazers typically stabilizes before the summer lull. Given the recent upward movement from the April lows and the consistency over the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase towards the 185-195 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at Period 15: The previous downward trend has reversed; demand has stabilized over the last three periods (12-14) at an average of 182 units, up from the period 9-11 average of 145.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer underwent a stabilization phase from Period 12-14 with an average of approximately 182 units. However, Period 15 (May 20) saw a significant drop to 143 units, which is a 21% decrease from that level and resembles the lows seen in mid-April (Periods 10-11). As the calendar moves into late May (Period 16, May 27th), demand for formal blazers typically softens as retail shifts toward summer-specific categories and vacation wear. Given the high volatility in recent weeks (191, 160, 196, 143), the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization near the lower end of the recent range, balancing the recent drop with the previous average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a stabilization phase from Period 12 to 14 (avg ~182), followed by a slight decrease in the most recent periods (Periods 15 and 16 avg ~155). The current date is early June, which typically sees a cooling off for 'Dressed' tailoring and fitted jackets as warmer summer temperatures arrive and professional wardrobe needs shift toward lighter options or vacation wear. Recent data shows fluctuations (143, 168) but remains below the mid-spring average. Given the downward trend from the late May peak and the seasonal transition into summer, I expect demand to soften further while remaining within the recent variance bounds.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Significant transition to summer cooling observed; demand has shifted from the Period 12-14 stabilization of 182 to a lower June average of ~155, reflecting a ~15% seasonal decline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal transition. After a strong spring performance (averaging ~215 units), the product entered a downward shift as anticipated for a structured blazer entering summer. The Carry-Over Insights from Period 17 noted a decline to a June average of ~155. However, the most recent observation in Period 17 (2019/6/3) was 118, marking the lowest demand point since April. Analyzing the last three periods (Period 15: 143, Period 16: 168, Period 17: 118), the average is 143. Given the current date of June 10, we are deep into the summer season, where demand for 'Womens Tailoring' typically cools significantly before pre-fall interest begins. I expect demand to remain low, likely around the mean of the most recent volatile periods but weighted toward the recent drop.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer (Mariette Blazer) shows a clear cooling trend as the peak spring tailoring season transitions into summer. The Carry-over Insights specifically noted a downward shift at Period 17, moving from an average of ~182 to a lower regime. The most recent three periods (16, 17, 18) recorded demands of 168, 118, and 139, resulting in a three-period average of 142 units. This reflects a significant drop compared to the May level. As of June 17, demand is expected to remain in this lower summer plateau, likely fluctuating around the 130-140 range. Given the slight recovery in Period 18 from the low in Period 17, but acknowledging the overall downward seasonal pressure on fitted blazers in late June, I am forecasting a stabilization around the recent average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical pattern analysis shows that the Mariette Blazer, being a 'Dressed' tailored item, has moved into a lower demand regime during the peak summer months. Previous insights noted a regime shift starting in early June (Period 17) with the average dropping to approximately 155. However, looking at the most recent three periods (Period 17-19: 118, 139, 122), the average has actually settled even lower at approximately 126 units. This indicates a further softening of demand as the peak season for tailored workwear transitions into casual summer wear and vacation periods. For Period 20 (June 24), demand is expected to remain in this lower, stable summer range. Given the recent sequence, a forecast near the 3-period mean is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: Summer low-season established; demand has declined from the May stabilization (avg 182) to a new lower plateau averaging 126 units over the last three periods (Period 17-19), a ~30% reduction.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal decline as we enter the height of summer. The product, a fitted woven blazer, is less suited for peak summer temperatures (July). Recent data shows a significant drop in Period 20 to 73 units, well below the previous 3-period average of 126 units (Periods 17-19). This sharp decline in late June suggests the 'Summer low-season' identified in the carry-over insights is deepening. For Period 21 (July 1st), I expect demand to remain at this new lower baseline or slightly lower due to the seasonal mismatch, though I will avoid overreacting to a single volatile drop by forecasting near the very recent low.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed at Period 21: Demand has dropped from the early June average of 126 to a new July baseline, with Period 20 seeing a sharp 40%+ decline to 73 units as summer heat impacts tailoring demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer (Mariette Blazer) shows a sharp seasonal decline as the calendar enters July. Carry-over insights confirm a downward shift in June/July (Period 21 noted a drop to a new July baseline). Period 20 recorded the lowest demand at 73 units, while Period 21 saw a rebound to 116 units. The current date is July 8, the height of the summer season when demand for 'Dressed' tailored jackets typically remains suppressed. The average demand over the last three periods (19-21) is approximately 104 units. Given the recent variability (73 to 116), I expect demand to oscillate around this lower summer baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal sensitivity. After a spring peak, demand shifted downward in June (Periods 17-19 avg: 126) and further declined in early July. Period 20 recorded a significant drop to 73, which was flagged as a potential new low-season baseline. However, Periods 21 and 22 have seen demand recover and stabilize at 116 and 120 units respectively. This suggests the sharp drop in Period 20 was a temporary outlier or the absolute floor of the summer trough. The current 2-week average is 118 units. Given we are in mid-July (typically the height of the summer slow-period for formal tailoring/blazers), I expect demand to remain in this established low-regime plateau of 115-120 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at Period 22: The sharp drop in Period 20 (73 units) has been followed by a rebound and stabilization, with Periods 21-22 averaging 118 units, establishing a mid-summer baseline for tailoring demand.

Predicted demand: 119 units

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' (a dressed tailoring item) has undergone several seasonal shifts. After a significant drop in late June (Period 20: 73 units) due to peak summer heat, demand has notably stabilized. The carry-over insight from Period 23 noted a mid-summer baseline. Demand for the last three periods (21, 22, 23) has been extremely consistent, recording 116, 120, and 120 units respectively (average 118.6). Currently in late July (2019/7/22), we are in a stable low-season period for heavy tailoring before the late-August transition to fall business wear. Given the lack of recent variance and the established baseline, the forecast continues the current stable trend.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal sensitivity to summer temperatures. Recent Carry-Over Insights noted a mid-summer stabilization around 118-120 units (Periods 21-23). However, Period 24 (late July) shows a sharp drop to 63 units, which is consistent with the significant decline observed in Period 20 (73 units). These local lows likely correlate with peak summer heatwaves or late-season clearance transitions for tailored items. Period 25 (July 29) remains at the peak of the summer low-season. Given the volatility between 60 and 120 units in July, the forecast weights the most recent sharp decline (Period 24) but anticipates a minor regression toward the recent local baseline (avg of 63 and 120), as demand often bounces back slightly after the deepest weekly troughs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern shows a long-term downward trend from spring peaks (~250-280) to mid-summer lows. (2) Seasonal context: Early August (2019/8/5) represents a mid-to-late summer phase where tailoring products like blazers often experience low demand due to heat, though interest may begin to stir for 'back-to-work' or autumn transitions. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand has been highly volatile in the last few periods (120, 120, 63, 94); the average of the last four periods is ~99 units. The drop to 63 in Period 24 followed by a partial recovery to 94 in Period 25 suggests a struggle to maintain the previous 'stabilization' level of 120. (4) Forecast logic: Given the proximity to the autumn transition but the still-warm August date, demand is expected to remain near the recent average. A slight recovery from the lowest dip (63) is noted, and I anticipate demand will align closely with the recent 4-period moving average of ~100.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Demand has shifted from the mid-summer stabilization of ~120 (Periods 21-23) to a new lower average of ~79 units over the last two periods (24-25), a ~34% reduction reflecting the deepest part of the summer trough for tailoring.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal cycle. After a spring peak reaching ~280 units, the product entered a mid-summer trough throughout July (Periods 21-25), with the low point averaging ~79 units. Period 26 (Aug 5) shows a sharp increase to 146 units, which is a nearly 55% jump from the previous period. This increase aligns with the start of August, signaling the beginning of 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn transition shopping for tailoring items. With the current date of Aug 12, this upward momentum is expected to continue or stabilize as consumers prepare for the cooler season. While the jump is significant, I expect demand to maintain this higher level or increase slightly further as sentiment shifts toward autumn fashion.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a significant seasonal shift in late August. After the summer trough (Periods 24-25 averaging 79 units), demand surged in Period 26 (146) and spiked to a series high in Period 27 (301 units). This aligns with the 'back-to-work' and early Fall transition period for tailoring products like blazers. Analysis of previous demand peaks (e.g., Period 2 at 284 units) suggests that such sharp spikes are often followed by a high-level stabilization or slight moderation as the initial seasonal rush peaks. For Period 28 (August 19), demand is expected to remain high due to sustained seasonal relevance, though it may moderate slightly from the extreme peak seen in Period 27.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 28: Strong upward trend observed moving into late August; demand increased from the summer trough average (~79) to a new seasonal peak peaking at 301 units (+281%), signaling the start of the fall/back-to-office seasonal surge.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand patterns for this blazer show a sharp seasonal surge in late August, typical for 'Back-to-Office' and fall fashion transitions. After hitting a summer trough of ~80 units in July, demand spiked to 301 in Period 27 and moderated slightly to 251 in Period 28. As of August 26 (Period 29), we are in the peak of the fall transition season. Given the average of the last two weeks (276 units) and the product's high relevance for late August/early September tailoring, I expect demand to remain in this elevated regime, slightly rebounding from the Period 28 dip as consumers complete their fall wardrobe shopping.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern related to back-to-office/fall fashion. After a mid-summer trough averaging ~79 units (Periods 24-25), demand spiked significantly in late August (Period 27: 301 units, Period 28: 251 units). The most recent data (Period 29: 231 units) shows a slight cooling from the initial peak but remains at a high seasonal plateau as we enter September (current date 2019/9/2). Labor Day in the US (Sept 2) often signals the official start of the fall retail season. Given the stabilization over the last two periods (avg ~241) and the seasonal relevance of a 'fitted woven jacket' in early September, I expect demand to remain strong but continue a very gradual normalization step-down from the initial late-August surge. I am forecasting 225 units, reflecting the established fall regime.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge confirmed at Period 29: Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime averaging ~261 units over the last three periods (27-29), a 230%+ increase over the summer trough, driven by the seasonal shift toward office-appropriate tailoring.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a major structural shift starting in Period 27 (mid-August), where demand jumped from a summer trough (~80 units) to a high-volume regime. The product is a blazer (office/dressed tailoring), which is highly sensitive to the 'Back to Office' and 'Back to School' seasonal cycle in late August and early September. Recent demand for Periods 27-29 averaged 261 units. However, Period 30 (Sep 2) saw a significant surge to 357 units (+54% vs previous week). This spike aligns with the peak 'Back to Office' week globally. For Period 31 (Sep 9), demand is expected to remain high but potentially settle slightly as the initial seasonal buying intensity cools from its absolute peak, following a pattern similar to the spring surge where peaks were followed by high-plateau stabilization.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand (357) represents a new peak for the product, following the Period 27-29 high-volume plateau (~261). This confirms a strong seasonal preference for tailoring in early September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a massive seasonal surge starting in late August (Period 27), coinciding with the transition to fall and 'back-to-office' shopping. After a high-volume plateau in late August (avg ~261), demand spiked to a new record level in early September (Period 30: 357 units). Period 31 (328 units) shows that demand remains elevated in this high-volume regime, though it has slightly decreased from the absolute peak. Given that mid-September is still peak season for women's tailoring, I anticipate demand will remain strong but continue a very gradual normalization/stabilization from the peak surge units as the initial seasonal rush subsides.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals a massive seasonal surge starting in late August (Period 27), peaking and stabilizing in September. The last three periods (P30-P32) have established a high-volume demand plateau with observations of 357, 328, and 341 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 342. As a blazer is a quintessential fall 'back-to-office' item, demand typically remains peak throughout September. Given the slight rebound from P31 to P32 (328 to 341) and the lack of signals for a downward shift yet, I expect demand to remain within this established high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-volume plateau confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a new high-volume regime averaging ~342 units over the last three periods (P30-P32), maintaining the seasonal peak established in early September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has reached an unprecedented peak in the most recent period (Period 33) with 612 units, nearly doubling the previous high-volume plateau average of ~342 units (established in Periods 30-32). This surge, occurring at the end of September (2019/9/23), likely represents the absolute peak of the 'Back-to-Office' and fall tailoring season. While a single-period spike of +79% suggests a significant acceleration, it may also include an element of extreme seasonality or a specific campaign impact that often leads to a slight correction or stabilization shortly after. However, historical performance shows that once a new baseline is established for this SKU, it tends to hold for several periods. Given the high momentum but the likelihood of a slight stabilization after a nearly 80% jump, I forecast a strong demand that remains well above the previous plateau while slightly moderating from the sudden P33 peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime surge confirmed at Period 34: Period 33 demand reached 612 units, an 80% increase over the September average (~342), marking the peak of the fall tailoring season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the Mariette Blazer underwent a massive seasonal surge in late September, peaking at 612 units in Period 33. The subsequent Period 34 demand fell to 313 units, which is consistent with a post-peak correction but remains within the 'high-volume plateau' identified in early September (averaging ~342 units for Periods 30-32). The current date is 2019/10/07. October typically sees a normalization of tailoring demand as the initial 'back-to-office' rush subsides, but before the holiday season begins. Based on the sharp drop from P33 to P34, I expect demand to continue stabilizing around the established September baseline of approximately 300-340 units, rather than returning to the extreme peak of 612.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major seasonal surge starting in late August (Period 27), peaking significantly in late September (Period 33 at 612 units). Since that peak, demand has undergone a corrective cooling phase, dropping to 313 in Period 34 and 283 in Period 35. This downward trajectory reflects the passing of the initial 'back-to-office' fall peak. For Period 36 (mid-October), I anticipate demand will continue to settle slightly as the season matures, but remain well above summer levels. Based on the 9.6% decline observed last period, I expect demand to land in the 260-270 range.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand analysis shows this product (Mariette Blazer) underwent a massive fall surge starting in late August (Period 27), peaking significantly in late September (Period 33 at 612 units). Following this peak, demand has corrected and stabilized at a high-volume regime. Over the most recent three periods (P34-P36), demand has settled into a very consistent range (313, 283, 282), averaging approximately 293 units. The current date (Oct 21) places us in the heart of the autumn professional/office-wear season where demand for tailoring remains robust but past the initial 'back-to-office' peak. Given the stability of the last two periods at ~282, I expect demand to remain near this current stabilization level before any late-season shifts occur.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-peak: Following the late-September seasonal surge (P33), demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime averaging ~293 units over the last three periods (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak fall/autumn demand phase. Historical analysis shows that after a massive surge in late September (Period 33 with 612 units), demand has stabilized at a high-volume steady state. The last four periods (P34-P37) have recorded demands of 313, 283, 282, and 313 respectively, showing very consistent behavior with an average of 298 units. The current date (Oct 28) represents the heart of the fall tailoring season, where office wear demand remains strong before any potential late-year holiday shifts or winter clearance cycles. Given the recent tight range (282-313), the forecast anticipates a continuation of this stable, high-volume regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has been following a strong fall-season trajectory. Following a period of stabilization (Periods 34-36) where demand averaged approximately 293 units, we have observed a significant upward trend in the last two periods (P37: 313, P38: 385). This 23% increase over the last two weeks suggests a late-autumn surge, likely driven by colder weather and the approaching holiday retail season. As of November 4th, we are entering a peak retail window. The Blazer, being a structured dresser item, typically sees sustained demand in November before the deep winter holiday shift. Transitioning from 385 units, I anticipate demand will either hold steady or slightly increase as the momentum continues toward the mid-November peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 39: The post-peak stabilization of ~293 units (P34-P36) has been surpassed by a new late-fall upward trend, with demand increasing ~31% over the last three periods (P36-P38) to reach 385 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong autumn peak for the Mariette Blazer, with demand recently peaking in late October (Period 38: 385 units). Period 39 (Nov 4) saw a significant drop to 231 units (-40%), which likely marks the beginning of the seasonal transition as tailoring demand typically cools in mid-November before potential holiday spikes or shifts toward heavier outerwear. However, the current period (Period 40) coincides with the week of November 11th. While not as dominant in all retail sectors as Black Friday, early November often sees promotional activity. Given the sharp drop in Period 39 followed by a likely stabilization around the mid-autumn baseline, and anticipating a slight lift from mid-month retail momentum, the forecast is set near the 3-period average (310) but weighted toward the recent downward movement. I expect demand to settle between the recent high (385) and the recent low (231).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is seeing high-volume demand typical of the fall tailoring season, though recent performance has fluctuated. After a late October peak (P38: 385), demand dropped significantly in early November (P39: 231) before partially recovering in the most recent period (P40: 278). The current period (Nov 18) precedes the Black Friday retail window, where demand for 'dressed' items often experiences a pre-holiday surge or holds steady as consumers prepare for seasonal events and work-wear refreshes. The average of the last two periods (P39-P40) is approximately 255. Given the recovery trend from P39 to P40 and the proximity to late-November retail peaks, a forecast slightly above the recent two-week average is appropriate to account for the anticipated pre-holiday volume.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal peak in late September/early October, followed by a high-volume autumn regime. Recently, the demand has transitioned from the late-October peak (Period 38: 385 units) to a lower November stabilization level. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has averaged approximately 251 units (231, 278, 245 respectively). The current period (Period 42) begins on November 25, 2019, which coincides with the week of Black Friday. Historically, retail demand for apparel and 'dressed' categories like blazers experiences a significant promotional uplift during this week. Given that the current baseline is around 251 units, and anticipating a notable seasonal spike due to the major holiday shopping event, I am forecasting an increase. While the product is a staple blazer rather than a high-trend item, a conservative increase of approximately 30-40% over the recent average is expected.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a massive spike in Period 42 (733 units), which aligns with the Cyber Monday/Black Friday retail week (Nov 25th). This follows a late-fall surge identified in Period 39. Historically, demand for office tailoring remains high through early December due to holiday parties and final year-end wardrobe updates, but typically experiences a 'cooling off' period immediately following the extreme Black Friday peak as consumer spending temporarily dips. The average demand over the three weeks prior to the spike (Periods 39-41) was approximately 251 units, suggesting a strong baseline. Period 43 (Dec 2nd) covers the immediate post-Cyber Monday week; I anticipate demand will retreat from the promotional extreme (733) but remain elevated relative to the summer/early fall levels as holiday seasonal demand continues. I am forecasting a return toward the refined November average while accounting for a slight residual holiday lift.

Carry-over insight: Promotional peak confirmed at Period 42: Demand spiked to 733 units (+192% relative to the P39-P41 average) coinciding with Black Friday/Cyber Week before returning to seasonal levels.

Predicted demand: 315 units

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a distinct pattern surrounding the Black Friday period. In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked significantly to 733 units due to peak promotional activity. Period 43 (Dec 2) showed a sharp post-promotion 'hangover' or correction, dropping to 169 units, which is below the late-fall pre-promotion average of ~251 (Periods 39-41). For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to begin recovering from this post-promo trough as holiday shopping continues, heading toward the baseline observed in early November. Given the historical trend of post-peak stabilization seen earlier in the year, I anticipate a return toward the mid-200s range.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer operates in a high-volume regime during the fall/winter months, typically averaging between 250-300 units (excluding promotional spikes). Following the Black Friday outlier (P42: 733) and the subsequent post-promotion slump (P43: 169), demand in P44 rebounded to 304 units. Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final full shopping week before Christmas, a period generally characterized by strong demand for 'dressed' tailoring as consumers finalize holiday party outfits and gifts. Given the rebound in P44 and the seasonal timing, demand is expected to remain consistent with the established late-fall average (approx. 280-310 units) before the typical late-December slowdown.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer experiences significant volatility around year-end events. Following the massive Black Friday/Cyber Week spike in Period 42 (733 units), demand dipped in Period 43 (169) and then rebounded to an average of ~281 over the last two weeks (Periods 44-45). Current Period 46 starts on 2019/12/23, covering the Christmas holiday and the start of post-Christmas clearance/boxing week sales. While retail activity is high, consumer interest often shifts from full-price tailored items to casual wear or heavily discounted stock during this specific calendar week. Given the average of the last two non-promotional weeks (281) and the likely seasonal exhaustion/holiday distraction, I expect a moderate decline compared to the immediate pre-holiday period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The product experienced a massive fall/early winter peak (Period 33-42) followed by a sharp decline in recent weeks. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The current date is December 30th. Historically, for a 'Dressed' upper body blazer, demand drops significantly during the Christmas week (Period 46: 128 units) as consumers shift focus toward leisure or holiday-specific attire. New Year's week typically marks the start of post-holiday clearances and a slowly returning focus to workwear, but demand generally remains subdued compared to the November/early December peak. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand fell from 258 (P45) to 128 (P46), a 50% drop. (4) Final forecast logic: Period 47 is New Year's week. While demand should recover slightly from the Christmas trough as retail activity resumes, it is expected to stay well below the December average (approx 215) until the mid-January corporate return. A moderate recovery from 128 to approximately 165 is forecasted.
