Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The item is a lined woven blazer, a professional tailoring piece. We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak holiday/Christmas week. Historically, demand for this SKU has shown significant volatility throughout the winter: a massive Black Friday spike (733), a sharp post-spike crash (169), and a recovery to a mid-December plateau (304, 258). Dec 23rd typically sees strong demand for holiday attire and gifts, followed by a potential post-Christmas dip as retail shifts to clearance and late-winter stagnation. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will forecast demand for Period 46 to remain in the 250-300 range, similar to the recent two-week average, but I must also account for the upcoming Period 47 (Dec 30), which is typically a very slow period for professional tailoring as offices are closed and consumer focus shifts to New Year's and then back-to-work in January. Since lead time is 0, the order placed now satisfies current period demand. I will target an inventory level of 275 to cover expected demand while minimizing holding costs for the year-end transition.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30, 2019, which effectively marks the end of the game period (Period 47). Analyzing the product (Mariette Blazer) and the calendar: we have just passed the Christmas/Holiday peak (P44-P45 demand average: 281) and the immediate post-Christmas week (P46: 128). Demand in Period 46 dropped by 50% compared to the mid-December average, which is consistent with the post-holiday lull as consumers shift away from professional tailoring after the festive season and before January 'Back-to-Work' cycles truly begin. Since Period 47 is the final period for which I place an order, I should aim to satisfy demand for this final week while minimizing ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The previous period (P46) saw 128 units sold. Given the decline and the late-December timing, demand for P47 is expected to be similarly low or slightly lower (estimate: 100-130). I currently have 147 units on-hand. This is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period without placing a new order.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Post-holiday January transition: Demand dropped 50% from the mid-December holiday average (281) to 128 in Period 46 (Dec 23), indicating the typical year-end clearance/lull phase for professional tailoring.",
