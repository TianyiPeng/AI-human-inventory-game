SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', categorized under 'Womens Tailoring / Dressed', which is typically a staple professional or smart-casual item. Historical data shows an upward trend over the last 5 observations: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186, with a mean of 173.4. The current date is February 11, 2019. In the fashion retail sector, mid-February marks the transition from winter clearance into the spring 'New Arrival' season, often leading to increased demand for versatile tailoring like blazers. Given the recent upward trajectory which rose from the 140s to the 180s-190s range, and the seasonal shift towards spring workwear, I expect demand to remain strong and slightly exceed the recent average.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand (Training Period) showed an average of 173.4 units with some volatility (range 145-196). In the most recent period (Period 1, 2019/2/11), demand jumped to 227 units, which is significantly higher than the training average. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed), this product likely experiences increased demand during the late winter/early spring transition as consumers prepare for professional spring wardrobes ('Spring/Easter' season). The date 2019/2/18 is mid-February, typically a peak time for new season workwear collections. Given the upward trend from the training set's final observation (186) to Period 1 (227), I expect the demand to remain elevated but potentially stabilize as the initial spring drop peak settles.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for the Mariette Blazer showed a stable mean of approximately 173 units (min 145, max 196). However, the observed demand for the first two periods of the current task (Feb 11 and Feb 18) shows a significant upward shift, with 227 and 284 units respectively. This indicates a strong upward trend or a seasonal entry into the spring business-wear season. Given the date (late February), demand for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' blazers typically ramps up as professional wardrobes transition for spring. Considering the jump from 227 to 284 (+25%), I expect a continued but slightly moderated increase as the product gains momentum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $635.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Numerical Analysis: Historical training data (likely from a previous year/season) averaged 173 units. Observed test data for the last 3 periods [227, 284, 198] shows a significantly higher baseline (average 236 units), indicating a regime shift or seasonal peak. 2. Seasonal/Product Context: As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), demand typically rises in early spring (March) due to professional wardrobe updates and spring events. 3. Trend Analysis: Period 2 saw a significant spike (284), followed by a correction in Period 3 (198). This suggests the initial peak might have been front-loaded interest, but the demand remains well above the training set average. 4. Forecast Logic: I anticipate demand to stabilize between the Period 3 low and the recent average as we move deeper into March. Forecast is set at 215, reflecting sustained spring interest slightly above the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019/2/11: mean demand increased from ~173 (training) to ~236 (observed), representing a ~36% increase likely tied to seasonal spring tailoring demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (5 periods) showed an average of ~173. Since the start of the test phase (2019/2/11), there has been a clear upward shift in the demand mean, as noted in the Carry-over Insight. The observed demand for Periods 1-4 (227, 284, 198, 214) averages approximately 231 units. The current date (2019/3/11) aligns with the peak spring retail season for women's tailoring/blazers. While Period 2 saw an outlier peak of 284, the subsequent two periods have stabilized around the 200-215 range. Given the 'Mariette Blazer' is a seasonal 'Dressed' item, demand is expected to remain elevated compared to the base training mean but relatively stable following the initial spring surge. I am forecasting a slight moderate continuation of this higher regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 1-5) shows a higher mean (~228) compared to the initial training data (mean ~173), confirming the previously identified demand regime shift. Over the last three weeks (Periods 3, 4, and 5), demand has stabilized significantly with values of 198, 214, and 215 respectively. This suggests the initial peak (284) has settled into a consistent 'Spring tailoring' plateau. Given the date is March 18th, we are in the peak season for dressed blazers (Womens Tailoring). The stability of the last two periods (214 and 215) suggests highly predictable demand. I will forecast a slight increase to 220, anticipating steady interest as we move further into the Spring season.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the initial seasonal spike, demand has settled into a stable plateau averaging ~210-215 units over the last three periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal increase starting in mid-February (Period 1), jumping from a training average of 173 to an average of ~236. Over the most recent three periods (4, 5, and 6), the demand has exceptionally stabilized, recording almost identical values (214, 215, 215). The current date is March 25, 2019. In the retail calendar, late March usually maintains steady demand for spring office wear/tailoring before potential pre-Easter spikes or mid-spring shifts. Given the extreme stability of the last three weeks, there is no evidence of a breakdown in the current regime, nor an immediate catalyst for a spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an average of 173 units. Since Period 1 (2019/2/11), there was a significant regime shift to an average of ~236. However, Periods 4-6 showed stabilization around 215 units. Period 7 (2019/3/25) shows a notable drop to 186 units (-13.5% vs. previous stability). This decline likely signals the end of the peak early-spring tailoring season as we head into April. While one period is not a trend, the timing suggests a return towards the original baseline or a lower seasonal plateau. I will forecast a slight further softening to reflect this downward movement from the March peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~173 units. Since entering the spring season (Period 1), demand shifted upward significantly. While Periods 4-6 suggested stabilization around 215, recent activity shows increased volatility: a dip to 186 (P7) followed by a sharp rebound to 249 (P8). The date (April 8) precedes Easter (April 21, 2019), a period typically associated with higher demand for 'Dressed' categories like blazers for formal spring events. The average of the most recent four periods is ~216, but given the strong momentum in Period 8 and the seasonal tailwind, I forecast a slight cooling from the P8 peak while remaining above the medium-term average.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical average for the spring season (P1-P9) is approximately 218, significantly higher than the training average of 173. Recent demand has shown high volatility (186, 249, 178), likely influenced by the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019). Period 8 (April 1) saw a sharp peak, followed by a significant drop in Period 9 (April 8). Period 10 (April 15) covers the week leading into Easter Sunday; demand for tailored blazers often stabilizes at a slightly lower level during the holiday week itself compared to the pre-holiday shopping surge. I am forecasting a demand of 195, which aligns with a slight recovery from the P9 dip while remaining below the P8 peak and slightly under the seasonal mean of 215.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a stabilization period around 210-215 units (Periods 4-6). However, recent performance has been volatile with a clear downward trajectory over the last three weeks: Period 8 (249), Period 9 (178), and Period 10 (130). Period 10 (April 15-21) saw a significant 27% decline relative to Period 9, potentially following the pre-Easter shopping peak for formal 'Dressed' tailoring. As Period 11 (April 22-28) covers the week of Easter Monday, a further cooling of demand is expected before stabilizing. I am forecasting a slight stabilization just above the Period 10 low, as the sharpest part of the post-holiday drop has likely occurred.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data showed a strong spring performance (avg ~215-220 units), but demand has sharply declined over the last three periods (P9: 178, P10: 130, P11: 127). This shift corresponds with the passing of Easter (April 21, 2019), suggesting the peak spring tailoring event season has concluded. Recent demand has stabilized at a lower level for two consecutive periods (~128 avg). Given Period 12 (April 29) is immediately following this downturn, I expect demand to remain at this new, lower baseline as the product enters a late-spring lulls before any potential transition to summer styles.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand decline confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~220 to ~128 (-42%) starting Period 10 (2019/04/15), indicating the conclusion of the peak spring tailoring season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~173 units. Observed demand showed a significant seasonal peak in early spring (P1-P8 averaging ~224) followed by a sharp post-Easter decline in P10 (130) and P11 (127). However, Period 12 (191) shows a strong rebound, suggesting the Easter-related lull has ended and demand is returning to an early-summer baseline for tailoring (weddings, graduations, and office refreshes). Given May 6 is a Bank Holiday in some markets often associated with retail shopping and preparation for the summer season, I expect demand to stabilize near this recovered level. Current logic weights the recent recovery in Period 12 and the historical training mean over the temporary Easter dip.

LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. After a seasonal peak between Periods 1-9 (avg ~220) and a sharp post-Easter drop in Periods 10-11 (avg ~128), demand has shown a recovery in Periods 12 and 13 (191 and 160 respectively). The recent recovery suggests that despite the conclusion of the peak spring tailoring season, demand is stabilizing near its original historical baseline of ~170 units. For the current period (May 13), demand is expected to remain consistent with this stabilized baseline as the market moves past early spring spikes into a steady late spring demand pattern.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer showed a peak in the early spring (Feb-Mar) averaging ~225 units, followed by a confirmed post-Easter decline (Apr) to ~130-150 units. However, recent observations (Periods 12-14) show a significant recovery: 191, 160, and 196 units respectively, averaging 182 units over the last three periods. This suggests a late spring/early summer rebound, possibly driven by wedding or graduation season events where 'Dressed' tailoring like this blazer is in demand. For Period 15 (late May), I expect this moderate upward trend to continue or stabilize near the recent average. Logic: Moving average of the last 3 periods (182) adjusted slightly upwards for the recent momentum seen in Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Late Spring recovery confirmed: Starting Period 12 (2019/04/29), demand rebounded from the post-Easter low (~130) to a new mean of ~182 (+40%), likely driven by seasonal event-wear demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows distinct seasonal shifts. After a post-Easter dip (Periods 10-11: ~128), demand entered a 'Late Spring recovery' phase (Periods 12-14) averaging ~182 units, likely tied to May social events and graduations. However, Period 15 showed a significant drop to 143 units. Given the current date is 2019/5/27, we are approaching the end of the spring event season and moving into early summer. The average of the last 4 periods (191, 160, 196, 143) is 172.5. The drop in Period 15 suggests a transition away from the peak May demand. I expect demand to soften further but remain within the current regime's lower bound.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer has shown significant volatility due to seasonality. After a post-Easter slump (Periods 10-11 at ~128), demand entered a 'Late Spring recovery' phase with a mean of approximately 182 units (Periods 12-14). However, the most recent two periods (15-16) have seen a slight softening, averaging 155.5 units. Period 17 (2019/06/03) falls in early June, where demand for 'Dressed' tailoring often sees a minor cooling before summer clearance or wedding peaks. The recent trend (191, 160, 196, 143, 168) shows high variance with a slight downward lean compared to the early May peak. Given the lack of a major calendar event for this specific week and the average of the last 5 periods being ~171, I expect demand to remain within the established range but slightly below the 182 recovery mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer (Mariette Blazer) has shown distinct seasonal shifts. After a late-spring 'event-wear' recovery where demand averaged ~182 during Periods 12-14, the last three periods (15-17) show a clear decelerating trend (143, 168, 118). Period 17 (118) is the lowest demand recorded since the training period, likely reflecting the transition out of the peak graduation/wedding season and into the height of summer where demand for heavier tailoring typically wanes. The average for the last three periods has dropped to ~143. Given the sharp drop to 118 in Period 17 and the date (early June), I expect demand to remain at this lower level or slightly decline further as consumer interest shifts toward summer casual wear.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Early summer demand decline observed: Demand has shifted from the late-spring average of ~182 down to ~143 (-21%) over the last three periods, with Period 17 hitting a seasonal low of 118 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a high-demand spring period followed by a significant decline as the season moves into summer. Demand for the Mariette Blazer recovered briefly in May (averaging ~182 units) but has since entered a lower early-summer regime. The last four periods (P15-P18) have averaged 142 units, with the two most recent weeks showing 118 and 139 units respectively. Given the current date of June 17, we are in a typically slow period for tailored outerwear before mid-summer clearances. The forecast reflects this stabilized lower demand, aligning with the current local mean of approximately 140 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer has shown distinct seasonal phases. Following a peak in early spring and a secondary rebound in May for event-wear, demand has entered a sustained downward trend as the season moves into late June. Recent observations from Period 17 to Period 19 show a consistent low-level range of 118, 139, and 122 units respectively. The average over these last three periods is 126.3 units. Given the date (June 24th) is deep into the summer season where tailoring demand typically softens before autumn transitions, and following a decline from the May average of ~182, I expect the demand to remain stable at this new lower baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant downward trend as we move into the peak summer period (July). The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, which typically sees lower demand during hot summer months. Analyzing recent periods: Period 17 (118), Period 18 (139), and Period 19 (122) showed a relative plateau, but Period 20 (73) represents a sharp 40% drop from the previous three-period average. This drop coincides with the typical start of summer clearance or reduced interest in formal woven tailoring. Given the abrupt shift in Period 20 to 73 units, the forecast for Period 21 (July 1st) anticipates continued low demand. While the drop to 73 might be slightly exaggerated by specific timing, the trend is clearly downward.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand collapse confirmed: Starting Period 20 (2019/06/24), demand dropped from a stabilized range of ~130 to 73 units (-44%), signifying the lowest seasonal point for heavy tailoring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant seasonal decline in demand for the Mariette Blazer as we enter mid-summer. The Carry-over insight for Period 21 confirmed a collapse starting June 24th, with demand dropping into the double/low-triple digits. Period 20 recorded 73 units and Period 21 recorded 116 units, averaging ~95 units over the last two weeks. This is a sharp contrast from the previous spring average of ~143-182. Given the 'Mid-summer demand collapse' and the nature of the product (a lined fitted jacket/blazer), demand is expected to remain low throughout July as consumers favor lighter, non-tailored garments. The forecast for Period 22 (July 8) anticipates a continuation of this low-demand regime, likely staying within the narrow band established in the last two periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows that the 'Mariette Blazer' underwent a significant seasonal contraction in late June (Period 20), hitting a low of 73 units. Since then, demand has moderately recovered and stabilized, with Period 21 (116 units) and Period 22 (120 units) showing very consistent behavior. Mid-July typically represents the tail end of the summer trough for tailoring before pre-fall interest begins to build. Given the recent two-week stability around the 116-120 range and no immediate calendar drivers for a surge, I expect the demand to remain within this stabilized low-summer baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the product experienced a significant mid-summer collapse in late June (Period 20: 73 units). However, the last three periods (21, 22, 23) show a consistent recovery and stabilization at a higher level (116, 120, 120 units), averaging ~119 units. This represents a confirmed shift away from the seasonal trough as consumers begin looking toward late summer/pre-fall office wear even in July. Given the perfect stability over the last two periods at 120 units, the forecast projects this baseline will continue into the current period (2019/7/22).

Carry-over insight: Post-trough recovery confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~119 units over the last three periods (Periods 21-23) after the mid-summer low of 73, indicating a new baseline as the season transitions.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern with a significant trough in mid-to-late summer. Analysis of the recent data shows a period of stabilization around 119-120 units (Periods 21-23), followed by a sharp drop in Period 24 (2019/7/22) to 63 units. This drop mimics the behavior seen in Period 20 (73 units), suggesting a recurring late-summer dip or 'clearance/transition' phase before the autumn season begins. Given the date (July 29), we are at the deepest point of the summer low for tailoring. While the average of the last three periods is approximately 101, the most recent observation of 63 suggests high volatility or a specific late-July drop. I expect a slight recovery from the absolute low of 63 as we move toward August, but demand should remain well below the previous baseline of 120.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer has shown significant seasonal volatility. After a mid-summer trough (reaching 73 units in Period 20), demand briefly stabilized around 119 units. However, recent data shows a renewed decline, with Period 24 at 63 units and Period 25 at 94 units (averaging 78.5 across the last two weeks). August typically represents the tail end of the summer sale season and the transition to pre-fall collections. While the product is 'Dressed' tailoring, demand remains near seasonal lows. The forecast weights the most recent two-week average (78.5) against the previous stable baseline (119), anticipating a slight recovery as the market moves away from the absolute July low towards early autumn interest.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a significant seasonal trough during the mid-summer weeks (reaching a low of 63 in Period 24). Since then, demand has entered a sharp recovery phase (94 in Period 25, 146 in Period 26), which aligns with the typical retail 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn transition for tailoring products like blazers in mid-August. The demand increased by 52 units in the most recent period. Given this strong momentum and the transition into a higher-demand season for dressed upper-body garments, the forecast anticipates a continued upward trend towards levels observed during the early spring and training periods (approx. 160-180).

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn recovery confirmed: Starting Period 25 (2019/07/29), demand has rebounded from its seasonal trough of 63, increasing for two consecutive periods to 146 (+131% cumulative), signaling the start of the 'Back-to-Work' tailoring season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a strong 'Back-to-Work' seasonal surge as we transition into late August. Historical demand patterns show a recovery from a summer trough (Period 24: 63 units) with sharp growth over the last three weeks: 94, 146, and finally a season-high of 301 in Period 27. This 106% jump in the previous week indicates high velocity in demand for professional tailoring. Given the date (August 19), we are currently in the peak period for Fall wardrobe shopping. While 301 is an exceptionally high figure, the momentum suggests demand will remain at an elevated level, though it may stabilize or slightly pull back from the immediate spike as the initial surge crests.

Carry-over insight: Autumn 'Back-to-Work' surge confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (94 to 301), with Period 27 representing the highest observed demand to date, confirming a high-variance seasonal peak for late summer/early fall.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer reached its seasonal trough in late July (63 units) and has since undergone a massive 'Back-to-Work' surge. The demand increased sharply through early August (94 -> 146 -> 301), peaking in Period 27. Period 28 (251 units) shows a slight deceleration from the peak but remains significantly higher than the training baseline and early summer levels. Historically, for tailoring products, late August represents the steady high-demand phase of the autumn transition. Given the slight cooling from the 301-unit peak but the continued relevance of the season, a slight stabilization near the recent average is expected.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern for the Mariette Blazer. After a mid-summer trough (Periods 20-24, averaging ~98 units), demand entered a 'Back-to-Work' surge starting Period 25 (94 units), peaking at Period 27 (301 units). The most recent three periods (P27: 301, P28: 251, P29: 231) indicate that while the initial peak of the surge has passed, demand remains significantly elevated compared to both the summer trough and the initial spring levels. The rate of decline is slowing (-50 units then -20 units), suggesting a stabilization into an Autumn baseline. For Period 30 (2019/9/2), I expect a further slight cooling as the primary seasonal transition concludes, settling near the 215-220 range.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand reached a seasonal low of 63 in late July and has since undergone a massive recovery phase. We are currently in the 'Back-to-Office' seasonal window (early September), which is a primary driver for women's blazers. Demand over the last four weeks (Periods 27-30) has averaged 285 units, a significant jump from the previous summer baseline. Although Period 30 saw a peak of 357, the overall volatility of the 'Back-to-Work' surge suggests a slight regression toward the recent mean of ~285 while remaining significantly higher than earlier seasons.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed: Demand has maintained an average of ~285 units over the last four periods (Periods 27-30), a 140% increase over the post-trough recovery baseline of ~119.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear Autumn 'Back-to-Work' regime shift that began in mid-August (Period 27). Since Period 27, demand has surged from a summer baseline of ~120 units to a high-demand plateau, averaging roughly 294 units over the last five weeks (301, 251, 231, 357, 328). The current date (September 16) is the peak of the autumn retail season for 'Dressed' products like the Mariette Blazer, as consumers update their wardrobes for cooler weather and professional settings. Recent demand (Periods 30 and 31) has been particularly strong, averaging 342.5 units. While there is high variance, the momentum suggests demand will remain at or slightly below this the recent peak level as the initial surge stabilizes. I will forecast a value consistent with the current high-demand average while acknowledging the slight cooling from the Period 30 peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal shift for this blazer, moving from a summer trough to a high-volume autumn 'Back-to-Work' regime. Demand significantly increased in August and has stepped up again in September. Over the last three periods (Periods 30-32), demand has stabilized at a higher plateau, averaging approximately 342 units (357, 328, 341). The current date (Sept 23) remains within the peak autumn tailoring season. Therefore, the forecast maintains the current high-demand regime baseline.

Carry-over insight: Secondary Autumn regime shift confirmed: Since Period 30 (2019/09/02), demand has increased from the previous ~285 average to a new sustained plateau of ~342 (+20%), reflecting peak seasonal demand for professional tailoring.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing its peak seasonal demand phase. Historically, the 'Back-to-Work' transition led to a steady recovery from a summer low of 63 to a stable high-demand plateau of ~342 units (Periods 30-32). Period 33 saw a massive, unprecedented spike to 612 units (+79% over the previous period). While the end of September and start of October (Period 34) align with key retail triggers like month-end paydays and cooler weather driving heavier tailoring purchases, a jump of this magnitude often represents a 'blow-off top' or promotional peak rather than a new permanent baseline. The forecast predicts demand will recalibrate downwards from the 612 spike but remain significantly higher than the previous 342 average due to seasonal momentum.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant seasonal peak for the 'Mariette Blazer' during the 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn period. Carry-over insights previously identified a regime shift to ~342 units starting in September. However, Period 33 exhibited a massive outlier surge of 612 units, which retreated sharply in Period 34 to 313 units. This retreat aligns with the established autumn plateau (~310-350 range) rather than the outlier peak. Given that October is still a strong month for professional tailoring before the winter downturn, I expect demand to remain stable near the current baseline. I will forecast a slight recovery from the Period 34 level, moving closer to the recent four-week average (excluding the outlier).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the 'Back-to-Work' autumn peak reached a high-demand regime in September, averaging approximately 342 units (excluding the Period 33 outlier of 612). Recent observations in Period 34 (313) and Period 35 (283) indicate a gradual cooling from this seasonal peak as we move further into October. While demand remains significantly higher than the summer baseline, the trend suggests a normalization toward the lower end of the high-demand regime. The forecast weights the most recent two-period decline (313 to 283) and expects demand to continue settling as the primary autumn purchase cycle concludes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a distinct seasonal pattern for this blazer. Following the massive spike in Period 33 (612 units), demand has retreated and stabilized. The last two periods (Period 35 and 36) recorded nearly identical demand of 283 and 282 units respectively, suggesting the peak 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn surge has transitioned into a stable mid-autumn plateau. This level (avg ~282) is slightly lower than the late-September peak but significantly higher than the summer baseline, consistent with professional tailoring demand in October. Given the high stability over the last 14 days, I expect Period 37 to continue this plateau before any potential pre-holiday shifts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Following the September peak (Period 33), demand has settled into a consistent plateau averaging ~282 units over the last two periods (Period 35-36), representing a -17% step down from the non-outlier September average of ~342.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern for the Mariette Blazer, with a significant 'Back-to-Work' surge in August/September followed by a plateau in October. In the last four periods (34-37), demand has stabilized significantly, yielding observations of 313, 283, 282, and 313. This indicates a consistent demand regime averaging approximately 298 units. As we move into the final week of October, there are no major calendar events to suggest a spike or sharp decline. Therefore, the forecast remains aligned with this established autumn plateau, weighting the most recent observation of 313 against the three-week trend.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear upward trajectory as we enter November. After a stabilization period (Periods 35-36) around 282 units, demand increased to 313 (Period 37) and surged further to 385 (Period 38). This +23% jump in the most recent period likely indicates the start of the pre-holiday shopping surge and potentially preparation for Black Friday events. Historically, this SKU has shown high sensitivity to 'Back-to-Work' and event seasons; the current date (Nov 4) aligns with early winter shopping trends where tailored outerwear and 'dressed' items see increased interest. Given the strong momentum from 313 to 385, I expect demand to remain at a high level with a slight continued upward drift or stabilization around this new peak.

Carry-over insight: Early Winter demand surge: Demand has increased for two consecutive periods, moving from a stabilized plateau of ~282 to 385 (+36% over two weeks), signaling the start of the winter holiday retail cycle for tailored garments.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the Mariette Blazer underwent an Autumn peak (~342 units) followed by a stabilization period (~282 units). Period 38 saw a sharp surge to 385 units, but Period 39 dropped significantly to 231 units, falling below the previous stabilization baseline. With the current date (2019/11/11) being mid-November, we are in a pre-Black Friday lull. Since Period 39 represents a potential downward shift or high volatility following the late-October surge, the forecast weights the recent drop against the historical Autumn baseline. Given the erratic nature of the last two weeks, I predict demand will partially recover toward the seasonal average of ~260-280 before the late-November retail peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows this SKU experiences high seasonal variance, with a major peak in September followed by a stabilization around 280-310 units. Recent demand has been volatile: Period 38 saw a spike to 385, followed by a sharp decline to 231 in Period 39 and a partial recovery to 278 in Period 40. The current date, November 18, is one week prior to the Black Friday promotional week. In retail cycles for tailored garments like blazers, demand typically builds during this period as consumers prepare for winter holidays. I expect demand to continue its upward correction from the Period 39 dip, moving back toward the established Autumn baseline of ~300. I am forecasting a slight increase over Period 40 as the market enters the pre-holiday shopping window.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' exited its peak autumn period (Sept/Oct) and stabilized around a mean of ~251 units over the last three weeks (Periods 39-41). Period 42 (2019/11/25 to 2019/12/01) includes Black Friday (Nov 29). Retail data for professional tailoring often reflects a significant lift during major promotional events as consumers purchase for holiday events or capitalize on discounts for workwear. Period 33 (late Sept) showed a massive spike to 612, indicating high sensitivity to either promotional activity or seasonal shifts. Expecting a substantial spike for Black Friday relative to the recent baseline, though likely tempered compared to the September seasonal transition. I forecast a demand increase of approximately 60-70% over the recent November average.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals a massive spike in Period 42 (733 units), coinciding with Black Friday. Recent demand prior to this promotional peak (Periods 39-41) averaged approximately 251 units. Period 43 starts on 2019/12/02, which is Cyber Monday. While Cyber Monday is a high-volume day, historical retail patterns for apparel typically show a significant decline from the Black Friday peak as the initial surge of promotions concludes. I expect demand to regress towards the holiday baseline (observed in Periods 37-41) but remain slightly elevated compared to the November average due to Cyber Monday and ongoing holiday event-wear interest for this 'Dressed' blazer SKU. I am forecasting a return to the 300-range, consistent with early winter demand levels seen before the outlier peak.

Specifically, Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive spike to 733 units due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions. Period 43 (Dec 2) showed a sharp correction down to 169 units, which characterizes the post-promotion 'hangover' or demand pull-forward. For Period 44 (Dec 9), we are deep in the holiday shopping season but past the initial post-Black Friday dip. Historically, for dressed items like blazers, demand typically recovers from the immediate post-promotion low as consumers shop for holiday parties and late December gifts. I expect demand to rebound from the 169 level towards the Q4 baseline observed in Periods 40-41 (approx. 245-278 units), but remain tempered by the pull-forward effect of the prior high-volume period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU shows significant seasonal volatility. Period 42 (2019/11/25) exhibited a massive spike (733 units) corresponding to Black Friday week, followed by a sharp correction in Period 43 (169 units). Period 44 saw a recovery to 304 units as consumers return for holiday shopping. Current Period 45 (2019/12/16) represents the final full week of shipping before Christmas. For tailored items like the Mariette Blazer, this period typically sees a mix of last-minute gift buying and 'party-wear' dressing, though demand often starts to taper slightly compared to early November/Black Friday peaks. The average demand over the last 5 weeks (excluding the 733 outlier) is approximately 245 units. Given the recovery trend in Period 44 and the proximity to Christmas, I expect demand to remain slightly elevated but face seasonal deceleration as shipping deadlines approach.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' (professional tailoring) has recently stabilized after the Black Friday outlier (733) and subsequent correction (169). Periods 44 and 45 saw demand levels of 304 and 258, averaging 281 units. Period 46 corresponds to the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). Retail demand for professional workwear typically experiences a seasonal decline during the final week of December as business activity slows and consumer focus shifts away from office attire. I expect demand to drop below the recent average of 281, following the downward trajectory seen between Period 44 and 45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant drop in demand during Period 46 (128 units), corresponding to the week of Christmas, which is consistent with seasonal patterns for professional tailoring like blazers. Period 47 (Dec 30) represents the week between Christmas and New Year. Historically, this week sees a slight recovery from the absolute Christmas trough as post-holiday clearance sales begin and consumers prepare to return to work, though demand remains well below the active autumn/winter peaks (avg ~300+). Given the sharp drop to 128, a moderate rebound to approximately 160-170 units is expected, reflecting clearance activity and the end of the holiday lull.
