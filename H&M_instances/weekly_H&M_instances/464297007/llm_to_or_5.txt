Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is cotton jersey thong briefs, a staple underwear item. Historical demand over the last 5 periods [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] shows a downward trend, dropping from ~300 to ~120 recently. The promised lead time is 0. Since we start with 0 inventory (on-hand + in-transit), we need to place an order immediately. Given the recent decline in demand, I will use recent_N (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking based on the older, higher demand levels (307, 298, 267), while still providing enough base stock (1+L=1 period) to cover the current demand regime. L is set to default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is cotton thong underwear, which generally shows stable demand without extreme seasonality in February. In Period 1, we ordered 285 units and they arrived the same period, confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods (L=0). Historical demand samples are [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159]. The recent Period 1 demand (159) is significantly lower than the older history (avg ~236), suggesting a possible downward shift or correction from a peak. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), we must avoid overstocking. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the most recent trend (approx avg 156 over the last few samples if considering the '122' and '159') while remaining responsive to the shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a massive stockout where demand spiked to 373 units (vs. previous mean ~200-250), exhausting all 185 available units and resulting in 188 units of lost sales. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a basic staple item. The actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods for both completed cycles (P1 and P2). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are facing a significant demand surge, I need to set parameters to recover quickly. The recent demand history [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373] shows high volatility but a clear recent spike. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime (averaging ~280 in the last 3 samples, with the last being 373) while maintaining L=0 to ensure immediate replenishment.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie). Current data shows high demand volatility, with a significant stockout in Period 2 (373 demand vs 185 stock). Historical demand [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] combined with recent observed demand [159, 373, 301] suggests a mean around 230-250, but with high variance. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand trend (avg ~277) while using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (standard deviation of recent samples is ~108). This ensures the base stock formula (z* approx 0.84 for $4 profit/$1 holding) provides enough buffer to avoid another stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1019.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of thong briefs. Current date is mid-March. Historical demand for the first 4 periods [159, 373, 301, 278] plus pre-game history [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] shows a mean demand of approximately 255. The most recent three periods (P2-P4) have shown higher and more volatile demand (373, 301, 278, avg=317) compared to earlier data. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (P1-P4 arrivals were all same-period). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is high (0.8), favoring a higher service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the recent higher activity levels while maintaining a lead time of 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (basic underwear), which typically exhibits stable demand. The current date is March 18th (mid-Spring). Reviewing history: Past 5 demands were [159, 373, 301, 278, 250]. The average demand is 272.2. Period 2 saw a spike (373) that led to a stockout, but demand has since stabilized in the 250-300 range. All historical orders (Periods 1-5) have arrived with a lead_time of 0, confirming the promised lead time is accurate and reliable for this period. With an on-hand inventory of 110 units, we need to restock to cover the next period's expected demand (approx. 272). I will use N=4 for mu/sigma to exclude the initial Period 1 ramp-up/outlier and focus on the current established demand regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a staple lingerie item. The date is late March (Period 7), currently showing a stable demand trend. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216], with an average of approximately 263. The peak in Period 2 (373) appears to be an outlier or early-season spike. Demand has been gradually declining/stabilizing over the last four periods. Looking at the last 5 periods (excluding the first initialization period), the mean is 283.6. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and standard deviation to capture this stabilization while excluding the very first low observation. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.8, which the OR backend will calculate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton thong (Womens Lingerie), which typically shows stable demand. Current Period is 8 (2019/4/1). Looking at history, lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has hovered around a mean of ~261 units (excluding the outlier in P2 where stock ran out). Recent observations for P3-P7 show demand of [301, 278, 250, 216, 253], suggesting a slightly higher but stable average recently compared to the older pre-history. There are no major upcoming seasonal events in early April that drastically shift lingerie demand. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since 0 is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime which is slightly higher than the overall average.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has shown a consistently stable demand pattern over the first 8 periods, with an average demand of approximately 264 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 8) was 283 units. There were no stock-outs since Period 2. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 9, I will use recent history (last 5 samples) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current plateau more accurately than the full history which includes the early transition. I'm setting N=5 for both to reflect the stable regime observed from Period 4 through 8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Briefs) shows relative stability without strong seasonal spikes in this specific period range. Past demands are: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] (pre-game) and [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253, 283, 176] (observed). The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). There is currently no pipeline inventory and 103 units on-hand. Given the consistency of lead time and demand mean (approx 255 units over the last 9 game periods), I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=9 for demand and volatility to capture the full observed history while smoothing out the high demand spike in Period 2 and the recent dip in Period 9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $535.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this item (thong briefs) has shown a softening trend over the last two weeks (P9: 176, P10: 169) compared to the previous average of approx 275. This suggests a post-spring peak cooling period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 141 and demand is trending around 170-180, I need to adjust the mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime to avoid overstocking and high holding costs, while maintaining enough buffer for the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio (4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the latest softening demand more heavily.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from ~275 to ~173 (-37%) over the last two periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) has shown a clear downward demand regime shift starting in Period 9 (late April). The demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) has stayed consistent around 174 units (176, 169, 176), compared to the earlier average of ~260-280 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable and confirmed, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To respond to this sustained lower demand level and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost implies an 80% service level target), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This focuses the forecast on the most recent 174-unit demand regime. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) experienced a significant and unexpected demand spike in Period 12 (323 units), far exceeding the recent 'low demand' regime identified in the carry-over insights (avg ~173). This spike on April 29th resulted in a complete stockout (ending inventory 0, lost demand of 145 units). Analysis of history shows lead times are consistently 0 periods. The recent demand history [176, 169, 176, 323] suggesting that while a lower regime was observed (Periods 9-11), volatility remains high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent mean shift and the latest volatility spike, ensuring the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the possibility of sustained higher demand following the stockout. This avoids relying on the much older, higher demand data from Feb/March while reacting to the current stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Volatility returned with a spike to 323 units after a 3-period low-demand plateau (~173), ending the recent downward trend and causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a cotton thong (Womens Lingerie). Current date is May 13th. Historical demand has been erratic: Periods 1-8 averaged ~265, Periods 9-11 dropped to ~173, Period 12 spiked to 323 (causing a stockout), and Period 13 dropped sharply to 122. The promised lead time is 0, and 'Period X conclude' messages confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Because demand is highly volatile (323 followed by 122), a simple long-term average is risky. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime shift and spike (~184 units/period), and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture the higher volatility seen in the last two months. This helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to protect against spikes like the one seen in Period 12, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in May: Period 12 saw a spike to 323 followed by a sharp drop to 122 in Period 13, indicating unstable demand patterns for this lingerie SKU.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) continues to exhibit high volatility during May. After a significant demand spike in Period 12 (323 units), demand dropped to 122 in Period 13 and recovered slightly to 151 in Period 14. The average demand over the last three periods (P12-P14) is 198.6, but the 'recent_N' average for the last 5 samples is approximately 188 units. Given the transition from a low-demand April to a volatile May, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture this regime shift while smoothing out the extreme P12 spike. Consistent with all history (P1-P14), the actual lead time is 0 periods, confirmed by immediate arrivals in the 'conclude' messages. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect this observed history. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility seen since late April. This configuration maintains a safe base stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P2 and P12, while reflecting the lower average demand compared to the start of the year.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) continues to exhibit significant demand volatility. After a major spike in Period 12 (323 units), demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) has stabilized at a lower level with values of 122, 151, and 171 respectively (mean ~148). The current date is late May (2019/5/27), and historical data provided shows a prior mean around 240, suggesting the brand is in a fluctuating spring/transition regime. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the normalization from the Period 12 spike while accounting for the recent range (122-171). For sigma_hat, N=7 is chosen to capture the extreme volatility observed since April (Periods 9-15), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle potential repeat spikes without excessive holding costs given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-Period 12 spike: Mean demand for P13-P15 is 148 units, down from the pre-spike volatility but trending slightly upward.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a steady recovery phase after a period of instability in late April/early May. Demand has shown a consistent upward trend over the last four periods (P13: 122, P15: 171, P16: 200). Since it is now early June (2019/6/3), demand for light cotton underwear/lingerie is expected to remain stable or slightly increase due to warmer weather. The mean demand over the last four periods (N=4) is 161 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent stabilizing trend while allowing for the observed growth from 171 to 200, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate rather than the higher historical averages or the extreme outliers seen in April.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: From a low of 122 in P13, demand has increased consistently for three periods reaching 200 in P16, establishing a new local mean of ~161.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464297007' is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Current context shows a demand fluctuation: after a recovery trend peaking at 200 in Period 16, demand dipped to 154 in Period 17. Looking at the five most recent samples (P13-P17: 122, 151, 171, 200, 154), the mean is 159.6. Although the previous 'Carry-over Insight' noted a recovery, the latest drop suggests demand might be stabilizing around this 160 units level rather than continuing to climb. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held (all historical orders arrived in the same period they were placed). To balance the high service level requirements (Profit/Holding ratio of 4:1 implies an 80% service level goal) against recent volatility (the spike in P12 and the dip in P17), I will use the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current demand regime. This period (P18) starts with an on-hand inventory of 35 and 0 in-transit. By setting L to 0 and calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods, the OR backend will target a base stock sufficient for the immediate period's expected demand plus a safety margin for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization around ~160 units: After a recovery trend from P13 (122) to P16 (200), demand dipped to 154 in P17, suggesting a new mean of ~160 for the Early June period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) is currently experiencing high demand volatility. Period 18 saw demand spike to 281 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~160. This resulted in a stockout (sold 184, left 0 on hand), and with no in-transit units, we are starting Period 19 with 0 inventory. The calendar date is June 17, and demand patterns for cotton lingerie often rise into mid-summer. Given the stockout and the recent jump (from 154 to 281), I need to adjust mu_hat to capture this upward movement while considering the historical volatility. I will use recent_N with N=6 to cover the period since the last recovery trend began (P13-P18), which includes the low of 122 and the high of 281, providing a mean that accounts for the current momentum without overreacting solely to the P18 spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged again in mid-June: Period 18 demand reached 281, breaking the 'stabilization at 160' pattern and causing a stockout.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) has experienced a massive surge, jumping from 281 in Period 18 to 556 in Period 19. This coincides with late June, a period often associated with the start of major summer sales or mid-summer seasonal peaks in apparel. The previous estimate of ~160 is no longer valid. Given the stockout for two consecutive periods and the 100% increase in demand, I am using an explicit forecast to aggressively adjust for this new high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit is $4 and Holding Cost is $1, leading to a critical ratio of 0.8, which justifies a higher safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this volatile peak. I am setting mu_hat to 500 to cover the potential for continued high volume and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the recent extreme variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge in late June: Demand intensified from 281 (P18) to 556 (P19), marking a significant departure from the earlier mean of 160. This likely reflects a seasonal or promotional peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $678.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (July 1st). The demand history shows a very high level of volatility in June. In P18, demand was 281; in P19, it spiked to a massive 556 (causing a stockout); and in P20, it settled back to 261. The 'Carry-over Insights' suggest a seasonal peak or promotional surge in late June. Over the last 3 periods (P18-P20), the mean demand is ~366. Inventory on-hand is currently 366, which exactly matches the recent 3-period average. Since lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to order enough to cover Period 21's demand. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 'summer surge' levels while the OR backend's service level calculation (q = 4/5 = 0.8) handles the tradeoff against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed for late June/early July: After a record peak of 556 in P19, demand moderated to 261 in P20, but the 3-period mean (~366) remains significantly higher than the earlier mean of 160.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early July (2019/07/08). Historical analysis shows a significant demand surge in late June (P19: 556, P20: 261, P21: 201). While demand has moderated from the all-time peak of 556, the current mean over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is approximately 325 units, which is still much higher than the pre-surge baseline of 160. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit is $4/unit and holding cost is $1/unit, favoring a high service level (80%). Given the recent volatility and the risk of post-peak settling, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the elevated demand level without overreacting to the singular outlier of 556. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened variance observed during the transition into July.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization following late June peak: July demand (P20-P21) has moderated to ~231 units, but the 4-period mean including the P19 peak remains elevated at ~325 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P19-P22) shows a significant but volatile high-demand regime, with values of 556, 261, 201, and 341. While the P19 peak (556) was likely a seasonal maximum, the subsequent three periods (P20-P22) average approximately 268 units, which is still much higher than the earlier 'stabilization' level of 160. Period 22 demand specifically increased to 341, suggesting that demand remains elevated in mid-July. Given the product is a cotton thong (summer-relevant) and current dates are mid-July, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (P19-P22) to capture this higher mean (~340 units per period) while maintaining a buffer for the observed high volatility (reflected by sigma_hat over the same 4 periods). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated in July: P19-P22 mean is ~340 units, significantly higher than the 160 units mean observed in early June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1639.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending June/July has shown a sustained elevated regime. Specifically, the last five periods (P19-P23) have seen demands of [556, 261, 201, 341, 422]. This averages to 356 units, which is a significant increase from the early-June mean of ~160. The product is a lingerie SKU (cotton thong), and late July often sees summer clearance or peak vacation demand. Given the two most recent periods (341 and 422) show an upward trajectory within this high regime, I will use a N=5 window for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~356. Sigma_hat needs to reflect the high volatility seen in this period (standard deviation of these 5 points is ~138). With a lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent history), the OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover this higher demand level, helping to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 18 and 19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained through July: The mean demand for P19-P23 is ~356 units, more than double the early June mean of 160. Periods 22-23 (341 and 422 units) confirm demand remains strong and volatile.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) has experienced high volatility throughout June and July. In Period 24, demand dropped significantly to 135 units from a peak of 422 in Period 23. Reviewing the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand values were [556, 261, 201, 341, 422, 135], yielding a mean of ~319. While the most recent period was low, the presence of recurring spikes in this summer period (June/July) suggests volatility remains high. Lead time 'L' remains confirmed at 0 based on recent 'conclude' messages. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated but volatile demand regime observed since mid-June, ensuring the base stock level remains high enough to cover potential spikes while responding to the recent low-demand observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late July: Following a peak of 422 in P23, demand fell to 135 in P24, continuing the pattern of extreme fluctuations (P19-P24 range: 135-556).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early August (2019/8/5). Recent demand history (P19-P25) shows extreme volatility with a wide range (133 to 556 units) and a mean of approximately 293 units. However, the last two periods (P24-P25) show a significant drop to 135 and 133 units, suggesting the late June/July peak season for this lingerie item (Thong briefs) may be cooling off or stabilizing at a lower level. Given the high volatility observed (std dev is significant), I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the elevated but declining July/August transition period (avg ~293). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 316, which covers the immediate mean demand but requires careful balancing to avoid overstocking as the peak subsides.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation in late July/early August: Periods 24-25 showed consecutive lows (135, 133), dropping significantly from the July peak mean of ~356 units. This suggests the seasonal surge has potentially concluded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1270.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Lingerie) shows significant volatility. In the recent period (P26), demand spiked back to 339 after two weeks of moderation (~134). This suggests the 'moderation' phase was short-lived or the product is experiencing a multi-wave seasonal peak in August. My previous assumption of a shift back to low-mean demand (160) was premature. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle this volatility while on-hand inventory is relatively low (86), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 (covering P19-P26) to capture the higher mean of approx 300 units observed since late June, rather than reverting to the earlier June mean of 160. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the extreme fluctuations (range 133-556) during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in mid-August: After a brief two-week drop in demand (P24-P25 ~134 units), demand spiked back to 339 in P26, suggesting either a second peak or continued high-volatility August demand for this SKU.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie thong) continues to exhibit high demand volatility throughout August. Following a spike to 339 (P26), demand moderated to 243 (P27). The recent demand history shows a pattern of sharp peaks followed by moderation (e.g., P19: 556 -> P20: 261; P23: 422 -> P24: 135). The average demand over the last six periods (P22-P27) is approximately 269 units, which captures the current high-volatility regime better than the long-term mean. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this sustained volatility while staying responsive to the recent moderation from the high August peak. This should maintain a service level appropriate for a high-margin product ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while preventing excessive overstock as we move further into late August.

Carry-over insight: August demand continues to be highly volatile with a secondary peak of 339 in Period 26 followed by moderation to 243 in Period 27; the late-summer regime (P22-P27) maintains a mean of ~269.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits high demand volatility, with a recent peak in mid-August (339 in P26) followed by a moderation to 243 (P27) and a sharp drop to 100 in the most recent period (P28). This fits the pattern of high-variance 'spiky' demand observed throughout the summer. While Period 28 was low, the previous August mean across P26-P28 is ~227, suggesting the current on-hand inventory of 269 is nearly sufficient for one period. However, given the profit margin ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) and the product's history of sudden 300-500 unit spikes, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the broader August demand regime (~248 units/period) rather than overreacting to the single low data point in P28. This provides a safety buffer against the volatility seen in the product's recent history. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand moderation: Period 28 demand dropped to 100, following an August mean (P26-P28) of ~227 units, indicating a potential end to the high-volatility summer peaks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a post-summer moderation phase. For Period 30 (Sept 2), demand has recently dropped from high-volatility summer peaks (which reached up to 556 in June and 422 in July) to a more stable range. The demands for the last two periods were 100 and 124. The mean of the last four periods (P26-P29) is ~202, while the mean of the most recent two is ~112. Given the seasonal transition into September, I expect demand to stabilize around the lower end of this range but remain cautious of potential late-summer volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent moderation while still accounting for the slightly higher mid-August activity, ensuring sufficient stock for a modest recovery without excessive holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility compared to the extreme summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned to a lower-volatility regime in late August/early September: Mean demand for P28-P29 dropped to ~112 units, down significantly from the August mean of ~227 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned out of its high-volatility summer regime (periods 19-27) into a much lower and more stable demand regime. Demand for the last three periods (P28-P30) has been 100, 124, and 101 respectively, establishing a new mean of approximately 108 units per period. This shift corresponds to the post-summer/back-to-school transition in early September. Given the consistency of this 3-period trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this lower mean and avoid over-ordering based on historical summer peaks. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the significantly reduced volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower levels in September: Mean demand for P28-P30 is ~108 units, a significant reduction from the August mean of ~227.

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Greta Thong has entered a lower-volatility, lower-volume regime since late August. For the last four periods (P28-P31), demand has been 100, 124, 101, and 77, respectively, establishing a new mean of approximately 100.5. Current on-hand inventory is 117 units, which exceeds this new mean, explaining why the OR backend placed zero orders last period. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the consistent downward trend and the start of the mid-September period, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new lower-demand regime while maintaining enough safety stock for the lingering but reduced volatility observed in previous months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for September: Mean demand for P28-P31 (approx. 101 units) shows a sustained 55% reduction from the August average (~227 units) with decreasing volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand unexpectedly jumped to 194 units, up from the ~100 unit mean observed since Period 28. This surge caused a stockout (sold 117, left 0). While September's mean was stabilizing, this recent spike (P32: 194) vs. the previous weeks (P28-P31: 100, 124, 101, 77) suggests a return of volatility or a small late-September peak. With on-hand inventory at 0 and zero in-transit, I must restock aggressively to cover the updated mean and volatility. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition from the low-demand streak back into higher consumption periods, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 28-32), which includes both the low-demand floor and the new 194-unit spike. Promised lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: September demand regime disrupted by a spike to 194 units in P32, ending a 4-period low-volatility streak (mean ~100).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) experienced a massive, unprecedented demand spike of 692 units in Period 33 (Date: 2019/9/23), which is the highest demand recorded to date and far exceeds the recent mean of ~100 units or the previous record of 556. This surge caused a total stockout. While the previous 5-period mean was approximately 139, this spike suggests a significant event (possibly a late-September promotion or clearance). Given the extreme volatility and the risk of continued high demand following such a massive outlier, I am using an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set mu_hat based on an adjusted expectation that blends the recent baseline with the spike's magnitude to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the risk of a sharp drop-off. The on-hand is currently 0, so the backend needs to order aggressively to recover.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme demand surge in late September: Period 33 demand reached 692 units, a new all-time high, breaking the September low-volatility regime (mean ~100) and causing a total stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) has entered a regime of extreme volatility in late September/early October. Period 33 saw an all-time peak of 692 units, followed by 335 units in Period 34. This likely represents a significant seasonal promotion or event. The previous mean was ~100. The last two periods average ~514 units. To avoid a repeat of the Period 33 stockout, I must explicitly set mu_hat to account for this elevated but highly volatile demand. Given the stockout in P33 and significant sales in P34, I will use an N=2 period average (513.5 units) to set my expectation for the next period, while maintaining an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the high risk of variance (using the difference between recent peaks). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the conclusion of Period 34.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand surged to an all-time high of 692 units, followed by 335 units in Period 34, establishing a high-volatility peak mean of ~514 units (compared to late August/early September mean of ~100).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14 (mid-October). The SKU 'Greta Thong Mynta' has entered a period of extreme volatility. After a significant demand spike in late September (P33: 692 units, P34: 335 units), demand moderated to 123 units in P35. Given the product category (Womens Lingerie) and the historical patterns observed in late June and August, these spikes are often followed by sharp moderations but maintain a higher underlying variance. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 602 units due to a large order in P35. To handle the uncertainty of the post-spike levels while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 (P33-P35) to capture the elevated but cooling demand regime (average ~383 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the intensified volatility (std dev ~286). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in October: Following a peak mean of ~514 units (P33-P34), demand dropped to 123 in P35, confirming a high-variance environment post-peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-126.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant demand volatility, with a major spike in late September (Period 33: 692 units) followed by Period 34 (335 units). Demand has since moderated in October, with Period 35 and 36 recording 123 and 100 units respectively. This 'spike-and-decay' pattern was also seen in late June/early July. Currently, the on-hand inventory is high (526 units) following large orders placed during the peak. Given the current date (late October) and the most recent observations, the demand is settling back to a lower level similar to the pre-spike September average (~100 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering the spike decay: P33-P36) which averages approximately 312 units, providing a buffer against further volatility while acknowledging the cooling trend. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to capture the extreme variance of the last 6 periods (from the P32 spike onwards). This conservative approach ensures high service levels if demand rebounds, while the OR backend's inventory-capping logic will likely result in small or zero orders this period due to high existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated in mid-October: Following the late-September peak (P33-P34 mean ~514), demand for P35-P36 averaged 111.5 units, returning to pre-spike September levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned into a lower-volatility regime following the extreme volatility and peaks seen in late September (P33-P34). The last three periods (P35-P37) have shown demand values of 123, 100, and 124, respectively, which aligns with the pre-spike September levels. The current on-hand inventory is 402 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand mean (~116 units). Since the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0, the OR backend targets a roughly 80% service level. Given the current surplus, I am setting parameters to allow the inventory level to naturally drift down. I choose N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization specifically, while maintaining a lead time (L) of 0 as consistently observed in the conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilization: Periods 35-37 show a consistent mean of ~116 units, confirming a return to moderate demand after the late-September peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak stabilization phase following the extreme demand spike in late September (P33: 692 units). For the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has stabilized at a much lower level, with a mean of 115.5 units (123, 100, 124, 115) and very low volatility. On-hand inventory is currently high at 287 units, which is more than double the recent weekly mean. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safe service level for this thong SKU, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this current regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low volatility. Since on-hand inventory (287) exceeds the base stock level calculated from these parameters (~130-150 units), the OR backend will correctly defer ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for mid-to-late October: Mean demand for P35-P38 is 115.5 units, showing a sustained return to the baseline levels observed in early September (~100 units).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-November (2019/11/11). Historically, demand for this item has been characterized by sharp, volatile spikes (P19 at 556, P33 at 692) followed by periods of stabilization around 100-120 units. Most recently (P35-P38), demand was stable at a mean of ~115.5. However, P39 saw demand rise to 241, indicating either a temporary fluctuation or the start of a pre-holiday surge. Given the current on-hand inventory is 46 units and the 0-period lead time, I must ensure inventory covers potential demand for P40. The current mean of the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is ~140 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the 115-unit baseline toward the 241-unit spike while remaining responsive to the 0-day lead time. L remains at the promised 0 periods as actual lead times have consistently matched the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility returned in early November: Period 39 demand reached 241 units, ending a 4-period stabilization regime (mean ~116) and potentially signaling the start of holiday season fluctuations.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has entered a high-volatility holiday demand regime. Period 40 demand reached 387 units, following 241 in Period 39, confirming a sharp upward trend from the October baseline of ~115. We are currently at zero inventory after a stockout in Period 40. Given the date (Nov 18) and historical spikes (e.g., late September seeing 692 units), we must prepare for sustained high demand throughout late November and December. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 samples (recent_N=2) to capture this immediate surge (mean ~314) and using a high explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed in previous demand peaks to prevent further stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed in mid-November: Demand increased from 241 (P39) to 387 (P40), marking a transition from the ~115 baseline to a high-volatility holiday regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late November 'Holiday' demand regime. We are currently at Period 42 (Nov 25), which coincides with the week of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Historical demand in the last two periods (P40: 387, P41: 348) confirms a significant surge from the October baseline (~115). Looking at previous peak events (e.g., Late September P33-P34), demand can reach extreme levels (up to 692 units). Given the high reward/profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is safer to over-provision to avoid stockouts during this high-stakes period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current holiday surge [241, 387, 348]. Average demand for these 3 periods is ~325. Setting L to 'default' as actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday regime confirmed: Demand for P40-P41 averaged 367 units, a 219% increase from the Oct baseline (~115). High volatility expected to continue through early December.

This shift represents the 'Black Friday/Cyber Monday' regime. Although demand dipped slightly in P42, it remains nearly triple the October mean. Lead time remains consistently 0. To capture this sustained holiday surge while allowing for slight moderation as we move deeper into December, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the 349-unit mean and the associated high volatility (std ~38) observed during the last three weeks, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level for this profitable SKU ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 9th, following the peak Black Friday/Cyber Monday period (P40-P42). Demand in the most recent period (P43) was 266 units, showing some moderation from the earlier holiday peak (~367 units in P40-P41), but remaining significantly higher than the October baseline (~115 units). As we are now in the mid-December period, demand is expected to remain elevated due to holiday shopping. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P40-P43) is approximately 328 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained holiday demand regime while accounting for the recent slight moderation and high volatility. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods based on historical concludes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December): Demand for P40-P43 averaged 328 units, reflecting a sustained high-volume period compared to the Oct baseline (~115), despite a slight softening in P43 (266 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1488.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the peak December holiday demand regime. Period 44 saw a demand of 380 units, exceeding starting on-hand inventory and resulting in a stockout (sold 372). The mean demand for the holiday period (P40-P44) is approximately 338 units, significantly higher than the October baseline of ~115. With the date being December 16th, we are approaching the final peak before the post-Christmas drop-off. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-volume window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current holiday average (~338) and maintain a high sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to account for holiday volatility. This ensures the base stock level is responsive to the current 300+ unit demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime peak: Mean demand for P40-P44 is ~338 units, confirming a sustained 193% increase over the October baseline of ~115 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate week before Christmas and includes the heavy shopping days leading up to the holiday. Historical demand for the holiday regime (P40-P45) has averaged ~342 units per period (387, 348, 311, 266, 380, 360). This is a significant sustained increase from the Oct baseline of ~115. Period 45 demand remains strong at 360 units. While demand typically softens post-Christmas, the immediate next period (Dec 23-30) often captures late-season sales and clearance starts. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this holiday regime mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility (range 266-387) observed during this peak season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P40-P45) mean established at ~342 units, a ~200% increase over the October baseline of ~115 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which marks the end of the holiday peak season. Demand over the last several weeks (P40-P46) has been extremely consistent, with a mean of approximately 344 units (latest demand P46 was 358). However, historically, demand for this SKU drops significantly after the December peak (as seen in the earlier 'baseline' around 115 units). For Period 47, which covers the New Year transition, I expect a slight softening but still relatively high demand compared to the October baseline. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the holiday regime's stable high mean (approx 344 per period) and 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility level. This approach ensures we maintain high service levels while we await the post-holiday demand reset.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P40-P46) mean stabilized at ~344 units with low relative volatility compared to previous surges.
