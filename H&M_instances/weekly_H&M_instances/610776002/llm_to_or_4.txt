Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for product 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt). The history shows 5 demand points: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. There is a clear upward trend in the last two periods (233 and 308), likely indicating a seasonal move towards spring. The mean of all 5 samples is 204.8, but the mean of the last two is 270.5. Given the promised lead time of 0 (same-period arrival for orders placed in P1), and starting with 0 inventory, we need to cover the expected demand for P1 immediately. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent growth more heavily while maintaining some statistical stability, as the product is an 'Everyday Basic' and likely to see sustained demand. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand and volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 296 units and they arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0, matching promised), but demand was higher than the historical data suggested (266 vs history ranging 148-308). The last five historical demands were [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], and Period 1 was 266, showing a strong upward trend/higher mean than the long-term history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent higher demand level (approx 233, 308, 266) while staying responsive. Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*average demand. I will set L to 0 (default) as the lead time of 0 was confirmed in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 2 (demand 316 vs supply 301). Historical demand [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266, 316] shows a strong upward trend. The last three periods (308, 266, 316) suggest a new demand regime significantly higher than the initial samples. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-day arrival). To prevent further stockouts and capture this higher demand level, I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the latest volume increase. Since L=0 is promised and historically observed, I will maintain the default lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 1: average demand increased from ~190 to ~297 (+56%) based on the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1210.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic t-shirt. Period 4 (early March) is typically a time when spring inventory starts to see sustained demand. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (orders arrive same-period). The demand over the last 3 periods [266, 316, 306] averages 296, which is significantly higher than the initial historical data [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. However, the most recent values suggest the growth has stabilized around this 300-unit level. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand data points. With L=0, the backend will target a base stock roughly equal to 1 period of demand plus a safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~190 to ~296 (+55%) and has remained stable for 3 consecutive periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current demand over the last 5 periods [266, 316, 306, 283, 308 (pre-history)] shows a stable high-demand regime compared to the pre-game samples. Since Period 1, the mean demand is 292.75. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 4. Inventory is currently 36 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the stability of the current demand regime over 4 periods, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current mean (~293) and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the immediate demand next period (since L=0, review+lead = 1 period).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt) shows a stable elevated regime since Period 1. The demand sequence [266, 316, 306, 283, 252] indicates a mean of approximately 285 units per period. The current date is March 18, moving further into the spring season for a jersey basic t-shirt, suggesting demand will likely remain at this level or slightly increase. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for a reactive ordering strategy. I will use the last 5 periods (the entire current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher demand volume while the 0-period lead time remains the base assumption.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday T-shirt, which typically exhibits stable demand in early spring (March). Across the first 6 periods, demand has averaged 282 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270), significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg 185). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights is well-established. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current stable demand regime (mean ~282, std ~22). This ensures base stock covers the current period's consumption while maintaining the 80% service level target (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable around 282 units/period (Periods 1-6) with low volatility; Lead time confirmed consistently at 0 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) shows a significant demand spike in Period 7 (364 units) compared to the previous average of ~282. This spike (April 1st observation reflecting late March demand) likely signals the start of spring seasonality for women's jersey basics. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Promised and actual lead times are consistently 0. To prevent stockouts during this potential seasonal ramp-up, I will adjust the mu_hat to capture this recent upward movement. Using N=3 for mu_hat (averaging demands of 252, 270, and 364) gives a more responsive forecast of 295 per period (or 295 for (1+L) period) than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also updated using N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen with the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Slight demand acceleration observed in Period 7 (364 vs prev avg 282), likely seasonal (Spring jersey basics).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt (610776002) is experiencing a seasonal upturn as we move deeper into April. The demand in Period 7 (364) and Period 8 (372) is significantly higher than the previous average (approx. 282). We have stockouted for two consecutive periods, indicating the current OR replenishment is under-forecasting the seasonal peak. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher demand regime (averaging 368 units/period) to stop the stockouts and capture the spring seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Seasonal peak confirmed (avg demand increased from 282 to 368). Stockouts in P7 and P8 indicate supply lagging behind current growth.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift starting in Period 7 (March 25th), aligning with the onset of the Spring season. Demand jumped from a mean of ~282 to a new peak (364, 372). While Period 9 saw a drop to 271, the stockouts in P7 and P8 suggests that the true demand potential is high. With the date approaching mid-April, Spring/Summer basics typically see sustained high demand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure we capture the current regime without being overly skewed by the single lower observation in P9 (which may be a fluctuation or late-season normalization), I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility calculations (covering P7-P9). This captures the recent high-volume trend while acknowledging the P9 dip. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the proven 0-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's everyday basic t-shirt. Current history shows a demand shift at Period 7 (late March/early April), aligning with Spring seasonality. Over the last 4 periods (P7-P10), demand has been 364, 372, 271, and 310, averaging ~329 units. The stockouts in P7 and P8 were due to underestimating this peak. P9 and P10 show correction, with a higher mean but some variance. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To bridge the gap between the high early-April demand and the slight cooling in mid-April, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current seasonal regime. This provides a balance between the high demand (~370) and more moderate demand (~290) observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand plateau: Following the Spring spike in P7-P8, demand has stabilized at a new higher plateau (P7-P10 average ~329) compared to the pre-seasonal average (P1-P6 average ~282).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), we experienced a massive demand spike to 564 units, far exceeding the recent average plateau of ~330 (P7-P10). This occurs at the end of April, likely representing a late Spring or early Summer surge for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts. The inventory stockout in Period 11 (sold 370 of 564) means the OR back-end's historical average will be skewed downward if we don't adjust. The lead time is consistently 0. I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) estimation to 'recent_N' with N=5 (Periods 7-11) to capture the higher volume regime (average ~376 including the spike) while providing some protection against the volatility seen in the last period. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased variance shown by the spike.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge at Period 11: Demand jumped to 564 (+71% vs previous 4-period average), likely reflecting late-Spring peak season for jersey basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's everyday basic t-shirt, which is currently in its late-Spring peak season (May). We observed a massive demand surge in Period 11 (564 units) and a continued high demand in Period 12 (424 units). The average demand over these last two peak periods is 494 units, significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~330. With a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by history) and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (target service level ~80%), we need to set mu_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus exclusively on the current seasonal peak (Periods 11 and 12). Lead time remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak intensification confirmed: Demand average shifted from ~330 to ~494 starting Period 11 (+50% increase) as May begins.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in its Spring/Summer peak season. Historical demand since Period 11 (May) shows high volatility: 564, 424, and now 304. While the most recent period (P13) saw a dip to 304, the average over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) is 430.6. Given the product's classification as an 'Everyday Basic' and the current date (mid-May), we should expect demand to remain elevated but potentially variable. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this recent seasonal intensity while accounting for the recent drop. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that balances the high service level needed for a $4 profit/unit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in its late-Spring peak season. Recent demand from Period 11 to 14 has been 564, 424, 304, and 431, averaging approximately 431 units per period. This confirms the seasonal peak intensification identified in previous carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal demand level while accounting for the recent variability (high of 564, low of 304), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the inventory level is responsive to the higher average demand of the current regime compared to earlier periods, while the 0-period lead time allows for rapid adjustments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand increased to ~431 (+31% vs P7-P10 average) as the late-Spring peak intensifies.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, a classic 'Womens Everyday Basics' item. As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), we are in the heart of the late-Spring/early-Summer peak demand season. Looking at the demand history since the confirmed regime shift at Period 11, we see values of 564, 424, 304, 431, and 442. The average for this peak period (P11-P15) is 433 units. While Period 13 saw a dip to 304, the last two periods have stabilized significantly at 431 and 442, suggesting a consistent high-season demand level. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to hold reliably. Given the high demand and the relatively low holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), the priority remains maintaining high service levels to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the season. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=5 (covering the P11-P15 peak regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this best captures the current seasonal volume and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels (avg ~433) for the P11-P15 period; Period 13 dip (304) appears to be an outlier in an otherwise high-demand May window.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak season (May/June). Demand has stabilized at a high plateau following a significant regime shift in Period 11. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 433 units (564, 424, 304, 431, 442, 435), with the Period 13 dip (304) appearing as an outlier. Removing the outlier, the average is 459. The current date is early June (2019/06/03), which is historically a strong period for lightweight jersey basics. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this sustained peak regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (76), so the base stock calculation needs to account for the consistent high demand and potential volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid stockouts seen in earlier surge periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels (avg ~433) throughout Period 11 to Period 16; current June window maintains high demand consistent with late-Spring/early-Summer seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2012.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 concluded with a significant demand spike of 640 units, the highest in the history of this SKU. This occurred at the start of June (2019/06/03), which aligns with peak summer demand for a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt'. The previous demand regime (Periods 11-16) averaged approximately 433 units/period, but Period 17's 640 units suggests a potential new shift or a sharp seasonal peak. Because the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we experienced a stockout (sold 503 vs demand 640), I will adjust mu_hat upward to capture this surge. I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering the start of the late-Spring/Summer regime in Period 11) but calculate an explicit mu_hat to safely bridge the gap between the previous 433 average and the new 640 observation, targeting roughly 480-500 to protect against further high-demand weeks while managing holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed in early June (Period 17): demand reached 640 units (+47% vs previous 5-period average of 434), suggesting a heightening of the summer peak for jersey basics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), currently in its peak Summer season (mid-June). Historical lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Since Period 11, demand has been in a high-volume regime, averaging 458 units/period (P11-P18). Although P17 saw a spike to 640 units (stockout), P18 returned to 419 units, bringing the current 2-week average to ~530. Given the high demand and the stockout risk seen in P11 and P17, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=8) to capture the late-Spring/early-Summer demand level while accounting for the recent volatility. Setting N=8 covers the period from the initial peak in P11 to the present, providing a robust mean (~458) and standard deviation for the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes lost sales during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand Summer regime confirmed for P11-P18 (average ~458 units/period). Demand volatility has increased during this peak (CV approx 0.22), necessitating higher safety stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's everyday basic jersey T-shirt, entering a peak summer demand period (late June). Analysis of the demand history reveals a high-demand regime since Period 11 (mid-April), with an average demand of approximately 455 units (excluding outliers) and a significant spike in Period 17 (640 units). The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show high activity with an average of 499 units, although Period 19 settled back to 439. Given the consistent 0-period lead time, the supply chain is responsive, but recent stockouts in P17 demonstrate that the previous mean estimates were slightly too conservative for the summer peaks. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the behavior since the mid-April seasonal shift (Period 11 to Period 19), which yields a mean of approximately 455 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current summer peak while accounting for the recent volatility seen in June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1st (Period 21), we are in the peak summer season for women's jersey t-shirts. Demand analysis shows a long-term summer regime established since Period 11 (May), but with high volatility and clear peaks in early June/late April. The average demand for the period P11-P20 is approximately 439 units. However, there is a noticeable recent cooldown in Period 20 (301 units) following persistent high demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current transition while maintaining high service levels for the remainder of summer, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 6-period window (P15-P20) which captures both the peak demand spikes (640, 439) and the recent lower readings (301), resulting in an average of approximately 446 units. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture recent high volatility (CV ~0.25).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P11-P20) average stabilized at ~439 units, but volatility is high (periodic spikes >600 and dips ~300).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically experiences high demand during the Summer months. We are currently in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). Reviewing the history, demand was consistently high from Period 11 through Period 20 (average ~434 units), but the last two periods (P20 and P21) have shown a significant drop to 301 and 232 units respectively. This suggests a post-peak seasonal decline or a cooling of the summer surge. However, the volatility in this SKU has historically been high, and we must be cautious not to under-stock if this is merely a temporary dip. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~304) and sigma_hat to capture the recent downward trend and high variance, while maintaining enough safety stock to handle potential spikes before the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected at Period 21: Demand has dropped below the summer peak average (approx 434) for two consecutive periods (301, 232), suggesting a possible transition out of the high-summer regime. Sustained evidence (3+ periods) is needed to confirm a new low-demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1) Everyday Basics T-shirt' has significantly cooled as we move into mid-July. After a high-summer peak (P11-P20 average ~439), demand has dropped for three consecutive periods: P20 (301), P21 (232), and P22 (238). The current average over these three periods is ~257, which is a significant departure from the previous regime. This likely reflects the end of the peak summer buying season for basic lightweight jerseys. Since the lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate'. To adapt to this new lower-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent cooling while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility seen in these recent samples (232-301), preventing excessive inventory holding as demand wanes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Summer peak ended; average demand decreased from ~439 to ~257 (-41%) based on the last 3 periods (P20-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has entered a clear post-peak decline as the summer season progresses (Date: 2019/7/22). Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level: 301, 232, 238, and 212 units, averaging ~246 units. This is a sharp contrast to the previous summer peak which averaged over 430 units. The carry-over insight from Period 23 confirms this regime shift. To avoid excess inventory and high holding costs in this lower-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which I will confirm using the calculate method.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand has maintained a lower average of ~246 units over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), confirming the end of the high-summer peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics jersey T-shirt has clearly transitioned out of the high-summer peak. Since Period 20, demand has stabilized at a lower level with a 5-period average (P20-P24) of 238 units (301, 232, 238, 212, 207). This marks a significant drop from the summer average of ~440. The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show even tighter stability around 219 units. I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak regime while maintaining enough variance for safety stock. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as confirmed by 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 72 units with no in-transit stock. Parameters set to target the new lower demand level to avoid excessive holding costs in the late summer/early fall transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized: Average demand for Period 20-24 is ~238 units, a 46% decrease from the summer peak average of ~439.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has transitioned out of the high-summer peak (Periods 11-19, avg ~458) into a lower post-summer regime. For the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has been: 301, 232, 238, 212, 207, 154. This shows a steady decline with the most recent sample (154) being the lowest in the series. The average of the last 6 periods is ~224, but the last 3 periods average ~191. Given the downward trend as we move into August, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the regime shift while allowing the OR backend to react to the lower volume. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to account for the reduced volatility in this lower-demand period compared to the volatile summer peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed: demand has declined for 6 consecutive periods (P20-P25), averaging ~224 compared to the summer peak of ~439 (-49%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to decline as we move further into August (Period 27), marking the end of the summer season. Demand has dropped consistently for seven periods, with the most recent demand (P26) hitting 102 units, significant lower than the post-summer average established in P20-P25 (~224). The current regime (P20-P26) shows a mean demand of approximately 207 units with a downward trend. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock policy will adjust quickly. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this recent deceleration and avoid overstocking as the seasonal peak fully dissipates. I will maintain L=0 as actual lead time has remained stable at promised levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Demand further decelerated to 102 units, extending the post-summer decline. The average demand for the last three periods (P24-P26) is ~154, a 31% drop from the previous post-summer average (~224).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics jersey t-shirt has entered a significant downward trend following the summer peak. We are currently in mid-August (2019/08/19), a period typically associated with the transition away from summer staples towards late-summer/pre-fall inventory. Demand has decelerated for several consecutive periods: 212, 207, 154, 102, and most recently 120. Over the last three periods (P25-P27), the average demand is 125 units, which is a sharp decline from the previous post-summer stabilization average of ~224. Given this sustained downward trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new lower regime (averaging ~145 units) while filtering out the volatile peak-season data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Safety stock (sigma_hat) is also adjusted to 'recent_N' to reflect the reduced volatility observed as demand levels off at this lower plateau, preventing excessive holding costs as seasonality wanes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Demand has entered a late-summer winding-down phase, with the last 3 periods averaging ~125 units, compared to the ~240 units seen in the post-summer transition phase (P20-P24).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues its late-summer decline as we move into late August (P29). Over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), demand has averaged 133.5 units (154, 102, 120, 158), which is significantly lower than the early-summer peak and even the post-summer transition phase. This confirms the 'winding-down' phase identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-margin basic during this seasonal trough, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime, while keeping L at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand trough confirmed: average demand for P25-P28 has stabilized at ~134 units, reflecting a 40% decrease from the P20-P24 transition average of ~238.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirts' has stabilized into a late-summer trough. Since Period 25 (covering the last 5 periods), demand has averaged 134.8 units (154, 102, 120, 158, 140), showing much lower volatility and volume compared to the summer peak. The current date is September 2nd, which typically aligns with the end of the summer season for lightweight basics. As demand has stayed within a consistent range (100-160) for 5 periods, I am using a recent_N of 5 to align mu_hat and sigma_hat with this current low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which is confirmed by every concluded order in the history.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P25-P29) stabilized at approximately 135 units per period, representing a significant drawdown from the summer peak (~439) and transition (~238) phases.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)'\u2014a lightweight jersey T-shirt\u2014has stabilized into a 'late-summer trough' regime. From Period 25 to Period 30, demand has averaged 136.5 units per period (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145), showing significantly lower volume and reduced volatility compared to the high-summer peak (avg ~439). The current date is September 9, which aligns with the end of the warm season for basic summer apparel. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this winding-down phase while maintaining a sufficient service level for the $4 profit margin, I will use a 6-period lookback (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the consistent behavior observed since P25 and prevents the historical summer peaks from ballooning the inventory base stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. Following the significant post-summer decline that began around Period 20, the demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P25-P31). Specifically, the demand values since Period 25 are (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141), with a mean of approximately 137 units and relatively low volatility. The product is a jersey basic, which typically sees its highest demand in spring and summer, explaining the current lower but steady volume as we enter mid-September. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'trough' regime while ignoring the high-volume summer data. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock appropriate for the current demand level, avoiding excess inventory as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Stable late-summer demand regime confirmed (P25-P31): average demand has hovered at ~137 units for 7 consecutive periods with low volatility, marking a sustained plateau after the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a stable late-summer/autumn regime. Demand for the last 8 periods (P25-P32) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak, with an average of approximately 137 units per period and very low volatility (the last four demands being 140, 145, 141, 135). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current demand regime is highly stable and has persisted for 8 periods, I will use N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-peak baseline while ignoring the historical high-demand summer data. This approach ensures the inventory targets reflect the current lower demand level while maintaining a sufficient service level for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1) Jersey Basic T-shirt' has stabilized in a late-summer/early-autumn regime. Period 33 demand (147) and the average of the last 9 periods (P25-P33) align closely at ~138 units. The seasonal peak (P11-P18) is long over, and the transition phase (P20-P24) is also concluded. With a stable current regime starting from Period 25 or 30, recent_N is the appropriate method to capture this plateau. I will use N=9 for mu_hat to cover the most stable period since the late-summer drop began, as demand has shown very low volatility (staying between 102 and 158). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. On-hand at start of P34 is 6, so an order for approximately 130-140 units is expected to cover Period 34 demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the most recent 10 periods (P25-P34), demand has hovered around a mean of ~135 units with relatively low volatility, confirming the end of the high-summer peak. In Period 34, demand was 106, slightly below the recent average but within the expected range for this phase. Current inventory is 47 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock needs to cover the current period's demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this stabilized plateau and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on a high service level (profit $4 vs holding cost $1, q=0.8), ensuring sufficient stock for the relatively stable demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' (610776002) is currently in a post-summer cooling phase. Starting from Period 34 (late September/early October), we observe a further decline in demand (106 and 85 units) compared to the 'late-summer trough' average of approximately 140 units. This suggests a seasonal shift as warmer weather basics (T-shirts) lose relevance moving into mid-October. The last 11 samples (P25-P35) show an average of 125 units, but the most recent two suggest a drift beneath 100. To prevent excess inventory in a declining regime, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (averaging 109 units/period) while maintaining enough safety stock via recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to handle weekly variability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand further decelerated starting Period 34: demand dropped below 110 units for two consecutive periods (106, 85), moving lower than the previous stable trough of ~137 units seen in P25-P33.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to trend downward as we move further into October. Since Period 34, demand has consistently dropped below the previously stable trough of ~137 units. The last three periods (P34-P36) recorded demands of 106, 85, and 84, resulting in a three-period average of 91.7 units. This indicates a clear cooling-off period moving away from the summer peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (Currently $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower demand regime (avg ~92). The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for the 1+0 period horizon and subtract the current on-hand inventory (64) to determine the order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~137 to ~92 (-33%) over the last 3 periods, reflecting a late-autumn decline for jersey basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' (610776002) is in a confirmed late-autumn decline. A demand regime shift was identified at Period 34, with average demand dropping from ~137 to ~92. Recent observations (Periods 34-37: 106, 85, 84, 109) support this lower plateau. The most recent demand of 109 in Period 37 caused a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). Although actual lead time is consistently 0, the current stockout and the slight uptick to 109 suggest we should use a slightly more responsive window for mu_hat (recent_N=4) to ensure the system orders enough to cover the current need while acknowledging the lower seasonal baseline. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P34-P37) captures the current regime (mean ~96) while providing adequate safety stock. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues its late-autumn decline as we move into November (Period 39). The demand regime shift identified at Period 34 is well-sustained. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), the demand sequence has been [106, 85, 84, 109, 78], resulting in a recent mean of 92.4 units. Period 38 showed a lower demand of 78, confirming the downward trend. Given the product's lightweight jersey nature, demand is expected to remain low or continue to drift downward as winter approaches. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized lower demand regime accurately while allowing for the slight volatility seen in P37.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand phase. Demand has significantly decelerated from the summer peak (~439) and the early-autumn transition (~137) to a more recent stable average of approximately 83 units over the last 3 periods (P37-P39: 109, 78, 61). There is a consistent downward trend as we enter November. The lead time remains reliable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding), \u03bc\u0302 will be set using recent_N=4 to capture the latest decelerating trend (averaging roughly 83 units), and \u03c3\u0302 will use recent_N=6 to account for moderate volatility during this decline. This strategy prioritizes lean inventory as demand likely stays low until the next seasonal cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand further decelerated in late October/early November: average demand for P37-P39 is ~83 units, down from the P34-P36 average of ~92.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a late-autumn decline. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is 79.25 units, showing a stabilization compared to the previous regime (P34-P36 average of 92). Current date is Nov 18, and demand typically bottoms out as winter approaches for lightweight basics. The Lead Time is confirmed as 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent stabilization at lower volume, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand stabilization confirmed for P37-P40: average demand has settled at ~79 units per period, down from ~92 in the previous transition phase.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has stabilized into a late-autumn trough. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been incredibly consistent, averaging 76.8 units (109, 78, 61, 69, 67). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the stability of the current late-autumn demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this specific plateau. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters. On-hand inventory is currently at 30 units, which is roughly 40% of one period's demand, justifying a fresh order to maintain the base stock level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which exhibits significant seasonality. We are currently in Period 43 (early December). Historically, demand for this item hit a trough in late autumn (Periods 37-41) averaging ~79 units. However, Period 42 saw a jump to 109 units. While one data point is not yet a confirmed regime shift, early December often brings a pre-holiday retail lift even for 'basics'. The current on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts during this potential seasonal uptick while respecting the higher profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will adjust the demand forecast. I'll use a recent_N calculation with N=3 (Periods 40, 41, 42) to capture the most recent lean average (~82) while incorporating the most recent spike, effectively biasing slightly upward to handle the volatility shown in Period 42. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th. Demand for this Womens Everyday Basics jersey T-shirt has been in a sustained late-autumn/winter trough. Over the last 6 periods (P38-P43), demand has averaged 74.2 units, despite a brief spike to 109 in P42 (Black Friday week). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since we are entering the mid-December holiday period, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as consumers shift focus away from summer/basic jersey items toward seasonal gifts. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable late-season average of ~74 units, while maintaining sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to account for the volatility seen in the P42 spike. This calibration allows for a lean inventory (on-hand is 39) while protecting against minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/Winter demand regime (P38-P43) stabilized at ~74 units per period, with a one-period spike to 109 during Black Friday (P42).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th, targeting Period 45. Historically, this SKU (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) has exhibited significant seasonality, peaking in Summer and troughs in late Autumn/Winter. We are currently in a stable Winter regime. The average demand for the last seven periods (P38-P44, excluding the Black Friday spike in P42 of 109 units) is approximately 65 units (78, 61, 69, 67, 61, 55). Including the spike, the average is 71.4. The recent trend shows a slight continued decline (P43=61, P44=55). I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture this stabilized low-demand winter period, which accounts for both the base demand and the recent minor deceleration. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: average demand for P38-P44 is ~71 units (median 67), reflecting the lowest seasonal levels for this basic t-shirt.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), approaching the end of the year. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal winter trough. Over the last 8 periods (P38-P45), demand has stabilized at a low average of approximately 71 units per period, excluding the Black Friday spike in P42. The most recent demand (P45) was 64 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs for this low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current stable winter regime. This timeframe effectively covers the post-autumn decline and the winter plateau.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). We are in a low-demand winter regime for this 'Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. Previous periods (P38-P46) show an average demand of approximately 73 units, with a slight uptick in P46 (92 units) likely due to holiday sales. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the year is ending and demand is at a seasonal low, I will use a recent window (N=5, covering P42-P46) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period includes the holiday spike and the subsequent stabilization, providing a representative forecast for the start of the new year. Using N=5 captures a mean demand of 76.2 units and covers the recent volatility (range 55-109) to ensure adequate safety stock for the transition into January.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized: average demand for P38-P46 is ~73 units (median 67), with periodic holiday-related spikes (P42=109, P46=92).
