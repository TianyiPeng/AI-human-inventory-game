  "rationale": "The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current date is December 23 (Period 46). Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn/early-winter baseline of approximately 55-65 units (P43-P45 avg: 60), following a temporary spike in late November (P42: 109 units). Historically, this SKU thrives in spring/summer and cools significantly in winter. Given we are in the week of Christmas, demand is expected to remain at this lower baseline or potentially dip further due to holiday retail closures or shifts in consumer focus towards heavier winter wear or gifting. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 46 units. To cover the current period's demand (estimated at ~60 units) while maintaining a minimal safety stock (approx. 15-20 units) despite the low stockout cost relative to holding cost in a low-demand regime, I will order enough to bring total availability to 75 units.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in summer (June) and has been in a sustained decline through autumn. We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the end-of-year holiday period. Period 46 (Dec 23) saw a demand spike to 92 units (a 44% increase over the previous week), likely due to final Christmas shopping. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0. Given the date (Dec 30), demand is expected to cool significantly as the post-holiday season begins, moving back toward the late-autumn baseline of approximately 60-70 units. I will order 80 units to satisfy this anticipated demand while maintaining a small safety buffer for early January, without overstocking as we exit the peak holiday period.",
