Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' (610776002). Historically, the last 5 demand points show a significant upward trajectory: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308. The most recent demand (308) is significantly higher than the average and suggests a potential trend or seasonal shift as spring approaches. Promised lead time is 0. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to quickly capture the recent higher demand volume (308) to minimize lost sales in the current period (L+1 demand). I will use recent_N=3 to weigh the recent growth more heavily while maintaining some statistical stability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's basic T-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 296 units with an actual lead time of 0 periods, which arrived immediately. Historical demands are [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] plus the newly observed Period 1 demand of 266. The demand shows a clear upward trend/regime shift starting from Period 4 of the past data (233, 308, 266). This suggests a higher baseline than the earlier samples. Given the promised lead time is 0 and the actual observed lead time for Period 1 was 0, I will stay with L=0. I will use the recent_3 samples (308, 266, and the mean of the others) to set mu_hat, but more specifically, I'll use 'recent_3' to capture this higher demand regime for both mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the recent volume while the 'cap' protects against over-ordering if the spike matches a short-term trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased and stabilized at a higher level (Avg ~269 over last 3 periods vs ~161 in first 3 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday T-shirt. We are in late February, moving into Spring, which typically sees rising demand for basic jersey tops. Looking at the history, demands have been: 148, 175, 160 (initial) and 233, 308, 266, 316 (recent). The last 4 periods show a significant step up, with an average of 281.5 compared to the earlier periods. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 2, we actually stocked out (sold 301, demand 316, ending inventory 0), which confirms we are underestimating the current demand regime. To prevent future stockouts while demand is high/rising, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand level (avg ~282) and account for the 0-period lead time (\u03bc = (1+L)*mean).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~161 to ~282 (+75%) starting around Period 4 of history/Period 1 of game. Sustained high demand for Womens Everyday Basics as Spring approaches.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, and we are currently in early March (2019/3/4), entering the Spring season where demand for basics typically increases. Historical demand (last 5 samples: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308) and game history (266, 316, 306) confirm a significant regime shift. The average demand over the last 3 game periods is approximately 296, significantly higher than the pre-game average of ~161. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. We currently have very low on-hand inventory (8 units) and zero pipeline. To ensure high service levels during this established high-demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~296) and volatility, and 'explicit' L=0 to stay responsive to same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand settled at ~296 (up 84% from initial baseline) as of P4, consistent with late winter/early spring seasonality for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11, entering the peak spring season for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 1 (averaging ~293 units over the last 4 periods). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time = 0). Inventory is currently at 36 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. To maintain high service levels during this shift from late winter to early spring, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand mean (~293) and variance. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period delivery.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. We are currently in mid-March, entering the peak Spring season. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift from the early baseline (~161) to a sustained high-demand phase (last 5 game periods average ~284.6). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Inventory ended Period 5 at 60 units with no units in transit. Demand in Period 5 was 252, slightly lower than the P2-P4 peaks (316, 306, 283) but still part of the high-demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand Spring behavior while filtering out the much lower pre-game history (148-233). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates and volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, transitioning from late winter into spring. The product 'Tilly (1)' is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal relevance. Over the last 6 periods (Game Periods 1-6), demand has averaged 282 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270), significantly higher than the initial historical baseline. The demand has remained relatively stable within this new regime (standard deviation ~23), indicating that the previously identified shift is well-established. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for highly responsive inventory management. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the service level target is high (~0.80). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this stable, high-demand regime while filtering out the older, lower demand figures from the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1212.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime, likely driven by the transition into spring (current date April 1). Demand in Period 7 spiked to 364, the highest seen so far, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The last three periods of demand (252, 270, 364) average 295, while the last five periods (283, 252, 270, 364, and the previous 306) average 295. However, since we just experienced a significant spike and a stockout, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the volatility (283, 252, 270, 364) which averages 292.25, while providing enough weight to the recent spike. I am maintaining the lead time L=0 as all orders since Period 1 have arrived within the same period (lead_time 0). The OR backend will use the target service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 80%) to calculate the base stock. By setting N=4 for sigma_hat, the backend will capture the increased variance from the recent spike to buffer against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 7 (364 units), confirming a high-demand phase as April begins for spring apparel.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is experiencing a significant demand surge as April progresses, consistent with Spring seasonality. In Period 8, demand reached 372 units, following a peak of 364 in Period 7. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Data from the 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). To avoid stockouts which occurred in the last two periods (Period 7 and 8), I am adjusting mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime using the last 3 samples (Avg ~335). Since L is 0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period. I will use a larger sigma_hat (recent_N=3) to account for the increased volatility and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to satisfy the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed in April: Avg demand increased to ~335 over the last 3 periods (P6-P8) compared to the prior baseline of ~290 (+15%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $971.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 1 to Period 9 shows a mean of approximately 303 units. However, there was a visible surge in demand during the last quarter of the game (Periods 7 and 8 saw demands of 364 and 372), which aligns with the seasonal transition into spring for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. While Period 9 demand dipped to 271, the overall trend since Period 1 remains significantly higher than the pre-game baseline. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods and the consistent actual lead time of 0 observed in history, I will continue to use a lead time of 0. To capture the recent higher demand level while accounting for the high volatility (stockouts in P2, P7, and P8), I will use the last 6 periods to calculate the demand parameters. This N=6 window (covering P4-P9) averages 302 units, which is conservative enough to avoid excessive holding costs while being responsive to the recent spikes. Sigma_hat is also set via recent_N to reflect the increased standard deviation seen in this higher-demand regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in high demand during the spring season. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Recently (Periods 7-10), demand has stayed elevated, averaging approximately 329 units (364, 372, 271, 310). The period 9-10 average is slightly lower at 290.5, but the overall spring trend remains strong. With on-hand inventory at 36, I will use recent trends to forecast demand for Period 11. I am choosing N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime since late March/early April (average ~329). I will use N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in this period (standard deviation is roughly 45 in this window). This will ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the expected 300+ demand while keeping lead time at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1480.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, demand surged to a record high of 564 units (dated 2019/4/22), representing a significant upward deviation from the recent average of approximately 340 units. This is likely driven by Easter/Late Spring seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Because on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending on-hand: 0), we missed substantial sales. The current average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 376 units. To account for this higher demand level and prevent stockouts while balancing the profit margin ($4) against holding cost ($1), mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-volume regime. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N to reflect the increased volatility (from 271 to 564 in three weeks). Lead time remains 0 as orders consistently conclude in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in late April (P11: 564 units), consistent with seasonal peak for spring apparel. Mean demand for latest regime (P7-P11) is ~376 units with increased volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/early summer season (May 6th). Demand has shown a marked increase over the last few periods: P11 saw a spike to 564 units (though capped by stock) and P12 had a demand of 424 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is approximately 384 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are sold within the current period. To avoid the stockouts seen in P7, P8, and P11, I am using recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the elevated volatility (std approx 100). This will target a service level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, accounting for the current seasonal momentum.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level for May: Mean demand for P7-P12 is ~384 units (up from the P1-P6 average of ~281). High seasonal volatility continues with recent weekly demand ranging from 271 to 564 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift starting in Period 7 (late March), with demand volatility increasing as spring progresses. The average demand from P7 to P13 is approximately 372.7 units, significantly higher than the early-game average. Although demand dropped to 304 in P13 from 424 in P12, the trend remains strong for 'Womens Everyday Basics' in May. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while being responsive to the most recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the period since the March demand shift). This ensures we buffer against the spikes seen in late April (P11, P12) while acknowledging the recent volume levels.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in peak seasonal demand for late spring and early summer. Observed demand over the last 8 periods (P7-P14) has averaged approximately 380 units, reflecting a clear regime shift from the early game baseline (~280). However, the most recent demand (P14: 431) and the high volatility (ranging from 271 to 564) suggest we must maintain a high service level to capture spikes. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand, high-volatility regime that started at P7. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the elevated mean while accounting for recent variability, ensuring we don't stock out during potential late-May surges.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a high-demand spring/early summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been consistently high and volatile, averaging 433 units (564, 424, 304, 431, 442). The stock-out in Period 11 and very low ending inventories in P14 and P15 indicate we are barely meeting this increased demand level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this Memorial Day/early summer peak while accounting for recent high volatility, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the 433-unit average, and using the same period for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late May: Mean demand for P11-P15 increased to ~433 units (up ~13% from the P7-P12 average of ~384). High seasonal demand for Jersey Basics continues into summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), we are entering the peak summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (jersey t-shirts). Historical performance from P11 onward shows a clear escalation in demand, with a mean demand of approximately 433 units over the last 5 periods (P12-P16: 424, 304, 431, 442, 435). While P13 saw a dip to 304, the overall trend has shifted significantly upward from the previous Spring baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this 'Early Summer' regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P12-P16) which aligns with the observed sustained increase in demand to ~430 units. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current period's volatility, which includes both the P11 spike and the P13 dip. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the summer peak while accounting for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer demand regime confirmed (June): Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has stabilized at ~427 units, representing a sustained increase over the Spring average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1828.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is exhibiting a strong seasonal surge as we enter June. Demand for Period 17 hit a record high of 640 units, significantly exceeding the previous week's inventory. The demand regime from P12-P17 now averages ~463 units (424, 304, 431, 442, 435, 640), reflecting a clear upward trend compared to the earlier Spring average (~384). Given the 'Jersey Basic' nature of the product and the June date (early summer), this peak is likely to persist or grow further. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher summer baseline (average ~463), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the heightened volatility (ranging from 304 to 640). This parameter set will lead the OR backend to raise the base stock to cover the current demand peak effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for early June: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P12-P17) has increased to ~463 units, driven by a seasonal peak of 640 units in P17. This represents a ~20% increase over the previous May regime (~384).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 17, 2019 (Period 19). We are in the heat of summer for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category. Historically, the last 7 periods (P12-P18) show a mean demand of ~453 units (424, 304, 431, 442, 435, 640, 419). This reflects a sustained high-demand regime for jersey basics during the transition from late spring into summer. Demand in P17 saw a significant seasonal peak of 640 units, indicating high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 100 for this recent period). While the most recent demand (P18) was 419, the underlying trend remains strong as we enter mid-June. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use the recent 7-period window (P12-P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the current high-demand summer regime while accounting for the increased volatility seen in the June spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June) stabilized: Mean demand for P12-P18 is ~453 units with high seasonal volatility (range 304-640), reflecting consistent demand for Jersey Basics mid-summer.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). Historical analysis shows a stable summer demand regime for this 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt. The confirmed demand regime for June (P12-P19) has a mean of approximately 440 units, with significant volatility (high of 640, low of 304). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is 87 units. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=8) to capture the summer plateau. Sigma_hat will also use recent data to account for the elevated seasonal volatility observed in the last two months.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts). The demand in Period 20 was 301, which is on the lower end of the recent volatility range (301-640), but the overall mean for the summer regime (P12-P20) remains high at approximately 434 units. Historical data and carry-over insights suggest that June/July is a sustained high-demand period with significant weekly fluctuations. Lead time has consistently lived up to the promised 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during the peak season while accounting for the recent high volatility (standard deviation remains significant), I will use the recent 9 periods (P12-P20) as the regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This period covers the entirety of the confirmed summer regime shifts recorded in the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) stabilized: Mean demand for P12-P20 is ~434 units, maintaining the high-demand state identified in June despite a lower Period 20 observation.

The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in the mid-summer period (July). Recent demand observations show a downward trend over the last two weeks (301 in P20 and 232 in P21), which is a significant drop from the June average of ~453. This suggests the summer peak has passed and demand is transitioning to a lower baseline as the clearance/late summer season approaches. The current on-hand inventory of 277 units already covers the most recent demand observation without additional ordering. To avoid building excess inventory during this deceleration, I will use a recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate downward trend effectively. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history, so I will continue using the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in July: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P19-P21) has dropped to ~324 units, down from the June average of ~453 (-28%), indicating the end of the peak summer season for Jersey Basics.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Tilly T-shirt) is entering a clear deceleration phase as the peak summer season (June) transitions into mid-July. The carry_over_insight from Period 22 noted a drop to ~324 units mean (P19-P21). Period 22 further supports this with a demand of 238, bringing the most recent 4-period mean (P19-P22) to approximately 302 units. This is a significant decrease from the June average of ~453. Consequently, I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 downwards to reflect this lower demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), a service level of 80% is targeted by the backend, but I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for both mean and volatility to avoid overstocking during this downturn while still maintaining enough inventory for the $4 profit potential.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration for Jersey Basics confirmed in July: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is ~302 units, down from the June average of ~453 (-33%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Jersey T-shirt) is showing a clear seasonal deceleration as we move through late July. Recently, demand has consistently dropped: Period 21 (232), Period 22 (238), and Period 23 (212). The mean demand over these last 3 periods is approximately 227 units, which is a significant decrease from the early summer peak of ~450+ units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals throughout the game. With 172 units currently on-hand and declining demand, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=5) to target this lower baseline (~244 average) more accurately and avoid overstocking as the summer season winds down. This protects against high holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed through late July: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has dropped to ~284 units, with the most recent 3 periods averaging ~227 units, signaling the wind-down of the peak summer season for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Jersey T-shirts) is clearly in a seasonal decline as summer progresses. The last five periods of demand (P20-P24) are 301, 232, 238, 212, and 207, which is significant when compared to the June peak of 640 and average of ~453. The mean of the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is approximately 222 units. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs ($1.0/unit) during this wind-down phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this lower regime using the most recent 4 periods (N=4). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 24 completed periods in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed through late July: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P21-P24) has stabilized at ~222 units, down from the June average of ~453 (-51%).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (Period 26). Demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline following the peak summer months (June/July). The last four periods (P22-P25) have seen demands of 238, 212, 207, and 154, with a visible downtrend as the season transition towards late summer/early fall. The mean demand over these last 4 periods is 202.75 units. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this deceleration phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower volume, and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the decreasing volatility observed during this wind-down.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed for late summer: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P22-P25) has dropped to ~203 units, continuing the downward trend from the June peak (~453) as the 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirt season ends.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirt is in a clear end-of-season decline as we move into mid-August (P27). Demand has dropped from a June peak of ~453 to a recent 4-period average of ~174 (P23-P26: 212, 207, 154, 102). The most recent demand was only 102 units. To prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs during this wind-down phase, I am utilizing the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (approx. late July/early August). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. This approach allows the base-stock policy to contract naturally with the observed seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late summer: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P23-P26) has dropped to ~169 units, emphasizing the seasonal exit for Jersey Basics.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline as August progresses. The demand has shifted from a June peak (avg ~453) to a late summer regime (avg ~144 over the last 3 periods P25-P27). Specifically, demand for P25-P27 was 154, 102, and 120 respectively. Given the 'lightweight jersey with a rounded hem' description, demand typically drops sharply as the market transitions toward autumn inventory. Current on-hand is 93 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0. To avoid excessive holding costs on a declining product, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a small window (N=3) to focus on the most recent, lower demand levels (average ~125). This will result in a lower base stock, preventing the OR backend from over-ordering as the product reaches the end of its seasonal relevance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized for late August: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is ~125 units, confirming a deep seasonal decline from the summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Jersey T-shirt) has entered a clear late-season decline as we move into late August (P29). The carry-over insights and game history show a significant downward trend from the June peak (avg ~450) to the most recent 3-period average (P26-P28) of approximately 127 units. In P28, the demand was 158 units, which depleted the on-hand inventory. Given the seasonal nature of lightweight jersey basics, the demand is expected to remain low or continue to drift downward. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P25-P28) which yields an average of ~133.5 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this late-season phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late August: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P25-P28) is ~133.5 units, down from the early August average (P21-P24) of ~222 units, reflecting the final taper of the summer jersey basic season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline following its peak summer demand. Historical demand for the most recent regime (P25-P29) has stabilized around a mean of 134.8 units, which is a significant drop from the spring/summer averages. The most recent demand was 140. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given the low holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), the OR backend will target a high service level, but we must account for the lower mean to avoid overstocking as the season ends. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-summer stabilization while ignoring the much higher historical summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late summer (Sept) stabilized: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is ~135 units, maintaining the seasonal low-demand state as the lightweight jersey basic season concludes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are in a clear seasonal low for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) with an average of approximately 136.5 units (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145). The most recent three periods (P28-P30) have been remarkably consistent, averaging 147.6 units. Since the 'Jersey Basic' season is winding down, I will align parameters to this new lower-demand regime. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this late-summer stabilization while ignoring the much higher spring/summer peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by history.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Jersey T-shirt) has entered a stable, low-demand late-season phase. As of September 16, demand has remained consistently low for the past five periods (P27-P31: 120, 158, 140, 145, 141), averaging approximately 141 units per period. The Promised Lead Time of 0 remains reliable as confirmed by every period in history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 14 units and the need to meet immediate demand with zero lead time, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent stability. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the summer peak. This conservative positioning prevents excessive holding costs while maintaining the required service levels for a high-margin/low-holding-cost item.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for P27-P31 is 141 units, confirming a consistent low-demand state as the summer season ends.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a stable low-demand regime characteristic of the autumn transition. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P27-P32) shows extremely consistent demand: 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135, with a mean of ~140 units. This follows a significant seasonal decline from the summer peak (~450 units). Given the high level of stability observed in September, I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this specific seasonal baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' logic. The inventory position is currently at 18 units on-hand, and the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level derived from this ~140 unit mean and low recent variance.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (Jersey T-shirt) has entered a stable, low-demand phase consistent with the end of the summer season in September. The last 4 periods (P30-P33) show a tight demand range of 135-147 units, with a mean of 142 units. This follows a significant seasonal decline from the June peak (~453 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain optimal service levels while minimizing holding costs in this low-volatility regime, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current stable state. The backend OR logic (z-score for 80% service level) will adjust the order to account for the current 4 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Late September demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for P30-P33 is 142 units with very low volatility (Range: 135-147), representing the post-summer baseline for Jersey Basics.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand has settled into a persistent low-volume autumnal regime following the summer peak. The latest demands (P31-P34) are 141, 135, 147, and 106, with Period 34 showing a further dip to 106. The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 132. Given the seasonal transition into October, further demand decline is likely for lightweight summer-oriented basics. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent average while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 41 units, so we need to order to maintain the base stock level for this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: October demand deceleration: Period 34 demand (106) suggests a further seasonal step-down from the September baseline of ~142 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline as of mid-October (Period 36). Demand has dropped from a September baseline of ~142 units to recent levels of 106 (P34) and 85 (P35). This confirms the 'October demand deceleration' noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given the products seasonal nature (lightweight jersey), I expect demand to continue trending lower or stabilize at this new lower baseline. I will use the last 2 periods of observation (Avg 95.5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the broader September data is now too high to reflect current seasonal reality. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for October: Mean demand for the last 2 periods (P34-P35) has dropped to 95.5 units, down from the September average of ~142 (-33%).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn seasonal decline. Period 36 continued the downward trend observed in October, with demand at 84 units, following 85 and 106 in the preceding periods. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is 91.6, confirming a sustained shift from the September baseline of ~142. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this local lower mean (approx 92 units per period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility in this low-demand state. Consistent lead time of 0 is maintained via the 'calculate' method. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes holding costs while covering the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P34-P36) is ~92 units, down from the September average of ~142 (-35%), reflecting the transition into late autumn for jersey basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirts is in a stable late-autumn regime. Period 37 demand was 109 units, slightly higher than the 84-85 units seen in the previous two weeks but still well below the September baseline of ~142. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is approximately 96 units. Given the transition into late October/early November, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for this stabilized lower demand while allowing for recent variability. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is ~96 units, confirming the seasonal shift down from the September baseline of ~142.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt is in a stable late-autumn low-demand regime as of early November. The last five periods (P34-P38) show demands of 106, 85, 84, 109, and 78, creating an average of approximately 92.4 units. There are no pending shipments, and actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 0.8), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the current stabilized autumn baseline.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for P34-P38 is ~92 units, confirming the lower seasonal baseline for jersey basics in late autumn.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (mid-November), moving deeper into the late autumn/winter season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirts. The demand has reached a lower, relatively stable baseline. Historical demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) has been 85, 84, 109, 78, and 61, resulting in a mean of 83.4 units. The most recent observation (61) suggests a potential further seasonal dip as the year ends. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 80%), I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower regime. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L=default is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for mid-November: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has stabilized at ~83 units, reflecting the seasonal low for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). We are in the late autumn/pre-winter season for 'Jersey Basics' (Womens Everyday Basics). Demand has consistently trended downward since the summer peak, stabilizing at a much lower baseline. In the most recent 6 periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged approximately 81 units (85, 84, 109, 78, 61, 69), with Period 40 recording 69 units. This supports the 'November demand regime' identified in carry-over insights. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To match this low-demand state and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for the $4 profit, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current stabilized low-demand regime starting from mid-October.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Pre-Winter regime stabilized: Mean demand for P35-P40 is ~81 units, representing the seasonal baseline for lightweight jersey basics heading into Q4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt is in a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Historical analysis shows a stable regime over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) with a mean demand of approximately 76 units and low volatility (range 61-109). Specifically, the last four periods (P38-P41) have averaged ~69 units. Given the transition into late November, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this established seasonal floor while maintaining a buffer for the minor volatility seen in P37. This will allow the OR backend to target a base stock roughly covering 150-160 units (reflecting the ~80% service level target) minus on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter low-demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for P35-P41 is ~76 units, reflecting the seasonal floor for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2), entering the winter season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts. Demand has remained consistently low compared to the summer peak. The last 8 periods (P35-P42) show a mean demand of ~78 units, with a slight uptick in P42 (109 units). This P42 spike might be related to early December promotions or Black Friday residue, but historically this category is at a seasonal low. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this late autumn/winter baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, which I will continue to use.

Carry-over insight: December demand baseline: Mean demand for P35-P42 is ~78 units, sustaining the seasonal floor for lightweight basics despite a minor spike in P42 (109 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44). We are in the seasonal floor for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (lightweight jersey T-shirts), heading into the final four periods of the simulated year. Historical demand over the latest regime (P35-P43) has consistently averaged around 78 units. The most recent demand (P43) was 61 units, and while P42 saw a minor spike to 109, the overall trend remains low and stable. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9, covering P35-P43) to capture the current late-autumn/winter baseline accurately. Lead time (L) remains at the default (0).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has reached its seasonal floor. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 73.9 units, with recent demand in the last 5 periods (P40-P44) slightly lower at ~62.6 units. Period 44 demand was 55 units. Given the low-volatility, low-demand winter state, I am using a recent window of N=7 (P38-P44) to capture the current mean (~71.6 units) and variance accurately. This compensates for the slight spike in Period 42 while reflecting the general downward stability. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) has stabilized at ~63 units, representing the winter trough for lightweight basics.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 46). Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt is at its seasonal floor for winter. Historically, lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The latest demand regime (P40-P45) shows a stable low mean of approximately 64 units. Given the holiday season (late December), demand is expected to remain around this baseline without significant spikes for this product category. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized winter trough while maintaining adequate buffers against minor volatility (e.g., P42). Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time has consistently matched the promised 0 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (late December/early January), which is the final period of the game based on the current context. The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirts is at its seasonal floor. The last five periods (P42-P46) have shown demand values of [109, 61, 55, 64, 92], with an average of 76.2 units. Although there were slight upticks in P42 and P46 (likely due to holiday clearance or early year-end shopping), the overall regime remains low. Since this is the final period and lead time is 0, the goal is to satisfy Period 47 demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will set mu_hat to 76 (the mean of the recent low-demand regime) and maintain standard volatility. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods.
