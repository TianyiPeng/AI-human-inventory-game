======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the last five weeks is [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. (1) There is a clear upward trend in the recent data, with demand more than doubling from the initial 148 to 308. (2) The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' suitable for spring/summer wear. (3) The current date is February 11, moving into the start of the spring season in many markets, which typically triggers an increase in demand for lighter baselayers. (4) Given the recent momentum (32% increase from period 4 to 5) and the seasonal shift, I expect a continued rise, though potentially moderating slightly as it finds a new baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt (Tilly) averaged 184.8 units during the training period, ending on a significant upward trend (reaching 308). The most recent observation (Period 1) shows 266 units, confirming that demand has shifted into a higher regime compared to the early training average. The current date is mid-February, which corresponds to the start of the Spring/Summer transition in retail for 'Everyday Basics.' The trend remains strong but shows signs of stabilizing around the 250-300 range after the peak of 308. I expect demand to remain elevated near the most recent observation as the seasonal shift continues.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Womens T-shirt) showed a steady climb in the training phase from 148 to 308. In the current test phase, demand has continued this upward trajectory with Period 1 at 266 and Period 2 at 316. The product is an 'Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt, which typically sees increasing demand as the Northern Hemisphere transitions from winter into spring (late February). The recent week-over-week increase is roughly 18%. Given the momentum and the seasonal shift towards spring apparel, I anticipate another moderate increase as the weather continues to warm.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand trend: average demand has shifted from a training mean of ~205 to a recent test phase mean of ~291 (+42%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 184.8 units. The test phase has shown a clear upward regime shift over the last three periods (266, 316, 306), establishing a new mean of approximately 296 units. Current date is March 4th, entering the spring season for a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which typically sees increasing demand as weather warms. The demand stabilized above 300 units in the last two periods. Given the product's classification as a 'Womens Everyday Basic' and the seasonal relevance of a jersey t-shirt in March, I expect demand to remain strong near the recent average, with a slight upward pressure for spring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1040.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to -1) showed a mean of 204.8. Since entering the test phase, the demand has stabilized at a higher level: Period 1 (266), Period 2 (316), Period 3 (306), and Period 4 (283), resulting in a test phase mean of 292.8. This confirms the previously noted regime shift. The current date (2019/3/11) marks the approaching spring season in the northern hemisphere; as a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt' for 'Womens Everyday Basics', the product is entering its peak seasonal relevance. Although Period 4 saw a slight dip to 283, the overall trend remains strong and significantly above the training baseline. I expect the demand to remain within the established high-demand regime, likely hovering around the 290-300 range as spring demand builds.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand throughout the training phase (avg ~225) shifted upward significantly at the start of the test phase (avg ~290 for Periods 1-3). However, the most recent data (Periods 4 and 5) show a cooling trend with demand dropping from 306 to 283 and then 252. This suggests the initial peak was likely a spring-season launch surge that is now stabilizing. March 18th is approaching mid-spring; as a basic lightweight T-shirt ('Everyday Basic'), demand is expected to remain firm but likely continue its gradual normalization from the initial peak. Given the trend of -31 units in the last period, a forecast slightly below Period 5 is appropriate to account for the decelerating momentum while remaining above historical training lows.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) showed an initial upward shift from training (~205) to the early test phase (Periods 1-3 average: ~296). However, over the last three periods (Periods 4-6), the mean has stabilized and slightly cooled to ~268. The current date is March 25, 2019. In the UK/Europe retail context, this period represents the lead-up to spring/summer seasons where lightweight jersey basics typically see steady or increasing demand. No major holiday spike (like Easter, which falls in late April 2019) is immediate for Period 7. Given the slight downward mean reversion from the initial peak but the generally high baseline compared to training, I expect demand to remain relatively stable near the recent average of 270.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical mean was ~205, but a regime shift occurred starting in the test phase, with demand established around a new mean of ~291. Recent observations show a slight dip in Periods 5-6 (252, 270) followed by a significant surge in Period 7 (364). This surge (March 25th) likely reflects the beginning of the spring fashion transition for 'Womens Everyday Basics' as temperatures rise. Given the current date is April 1st, demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts is expected to remain elevated. While Period 7 reached 364, I expect a slight normalization followed by sustained high demand for the start of the month. The forecast weights the recent upward momentum and seasonal suitability for spring basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1448.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training mean was approximately 205. Since entering the test phase, there has been a sustained upward shift. Over the last 8 periods, the average demand has risen to 303.6 units. Specifically, looking at the most recent periods (7 and 8), there has been a significant surge (from mid-200s to 364 and 372). This matches the product description (a lightweight jersey T-shirt), which typically sees increased demand as the spring season progresses (April date). Given the momentum of the last two weeks and the seasonal relevance of basics for spring wardrobes, a slight continuation or stabilization at this higher level is expected.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Sustained upward acceleration confirmed; the demand regime has shifted from an early test mean of ~290 (Periods 1-4) to a recent high-demand cluster (Periods 7-8) averaging 368 units (+27% increase within the test phase).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt (Everyday Basics) shows a complex pattern of volatility. After a significant demand spike in Period 7 (364) and Period 8 (372)\u2014likely driven by early spring shopping or a specific retail promotion\u2014demand dropped sharply in Period 9 (271). This drop suggests the previous high-demand regime was a transient peak rather than a sustained plateau. Period 10 (April 15, 2019) is the week leading up to Easter Sunday (April 21). In the apparel category, this typically presents a slight recovery or stabilization in demand for basics as consumers finalize spring/holiday wardrobes. The forecast assumes demand will stabilize slightly above the P9 drop, aligning closer to the overall test phase mean (~300) without reaching the unsustainable P7-P8 peaks.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as weather warms in the Northern Hemisphere spring (April). Historical training data averaged ~185. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift: early test periods averaged ~293, while Periods 7 and 8 spiked significantly to ~368. However, recent data (Periods 9 and 10) show a cooling of that peak, with demand returning to a range around 290-310 (avg 290.5). Current date (2019/4/22) follows the Easter period in many regions, which can lead to a slight stabilization or post-holiday dip before the lead-up to summer. I expect demand to remain relatively stable around the new established baseline range (~300), factoring in the slight upward nudge from the warming season counterbalanced by the correction from the late-March surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory with a significant spike in Period 11 (564 units). Analysis of historical data shows a jump from an initial average of ~200 (Training) to ~300 (early Test phase) and now moving towards a higher regime. Period 11 coincided with the week leading up to Easter Monday (April 22, 2019), which typically drives retail traffic. Period 12 (April 29) follows a massive peak; historically, after such spikes, demand often experiences a partial retracement but settles at a higher baseline than previous 'normal' weeks due to late spring seasonality for lightweight jersey tops. Given the momentum and the shift noted in Period 9, the demand is expected to remain high, though lower than the peak of 564. I anticipate a level around 430-450, reflecting seasonal growth and post-holiday stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 11 spike (564) and seasonal transition into late Spring have shifted the expected baseline; the last 5 periods (7-11) now average 376 units compared to the Period 9 carry-over average of 368.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic jersey T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as the weather warms in May. Historical test data shows a clear regime shift: early test periods (1-6) averaged ~282 units, while recent periods (7-12) averaged ~384 units. Period 11 saw a massive spike to 564 (Easter/Spring Peak), followed by a correction to 424 in Period 12. Although Period 12 is lower than the peak, it remains significantly above the baseline of 350-370 seen in Periods 7-8. For Period 13 (early May), demand is expected to remain in this high-demand regime as spring weather stabilizes, likely settling between the previous baseline and the recent peak. I forecast a slight stabilization from the previous period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt (product 610776002) has shown significant volatility in the recent test phase. A major spike occurred in Period 11 (564 units) and Period 12 (424 units), likely driven by late Spring/Easter seasonality or a specific promotion. However, Period 13 (304 units) shows a sharp regression towards the established baseline seen in Periods 1-6 (avg ~282) and Periods 9-10 (avg ~290). As we are now in mid-May (2019/05/13), the weather is warming, which generally supports demand for jersey basics like T-shirts, but the immediate post-peak cooldown suggests demand will fluctuate around the 300-330 range. Given Period 13's observation of 304, I forecast a slight increase for Period 14 as seasonal T-shirt weather strengthens, while remaining well below the previous anomaly peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we move into the warmer spring/summer months. Recent demand has become increasingly volatile but maintains a high baseline. The last 4 periods (Periods 11-14) show a significant lift, averaging 430.75 units, compared to the previously established high-demand regime of ~370. Period 11 (Easter Monday) saw a massive spike to 564, followed by a stabilization above 300. Given the date (May 20), we are approaching peak summer demand for basic jersey items. The most recent observation (Period 14) was 431, and the average of the last two periods is ~368. Considering the strengthening seasonal trend and the shift identified in Period 12, I expect demand to remain in the 400+ range.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Upward demand regime shift confirmed; the last 4 periods (11-14) average 431 units, representing a ~15% increase over the previous high-demand baseline of 376 units recorded at Period 12.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this basic jersey T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we move into late Spring and early Summer. Since Period 11, demand has shifted to a significantly higher plateau. The last five periods (Periods 11-15) show an average demand of 433 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~376 units. Specifically, the last two periods (431 and 442) indicate stabilization at this higher level. Given the date (May 27th), demand is expected to remain high due to seasonal relevance for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops. I am forecasting a slight continuation of this peak trend while recognizing the erratic nature of the recent spikes (e.g., Period 11). A forecast around the recent mean is appropriate.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' jersey T-shirt has entered a stable high-demand regime as it moves into the peak summer season (early June). Analysis of the last three periods (Periods 14, 15, and 16) shows highly consistent demand of 431, 442, and 435 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of approximately 436 units. This level aligns with the previously identified upward regime shift noted in Period 15 (avg 431). Given the product's seasonal relevance as a lightweight basic, demand is expected to remain near this current baseline. I am forecasting a continuation of this stable trend, slightly moderated towards the recent 3-period mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as it moves into the summer season. Recent demand has consolidated at a higher level, with Periods 14-16 averaging 436 units. Period 17 (June 3) saw a significant spike to 640 units, likely driven by the onset of warmer June weather and early summer shopping. While Period 17 may be an outlier peak, the current date of June 10 suggests sustained high demand for lightweight jersey basics. I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly retract from the extreme Period 17 peak, settling into a new high-summer baseline between the recent average and the most recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Sustained summer demand shift confirmed; the last 4 periods (14-17) average 487 units, a 13% increase over the Period 15 baseline of 431.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt is in a clear upward trend as we move into the peak summer season. Historical data shows significant volatility with periodic spikes (e.g., Period 11 at 564, Period 17 at 640). The average demand over the last four periods (15-18) is approximately 484 units, which aligns with the upward trend noted in carry-over insights. However, after the large spike in Period 17 (640), Period 18 saw a correction back down to 419. Given the date (June 17), we are entering peak summer sales. I expect demand to stabilize around the current high-regime mean rather than spike immediately again, but stay well above the 400-unit mark. I will forecast a slight increase from Period 18 toward the recent four-period average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basic T-shirt) is currently in its peak summer season. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trajectory through Spring and into June. Recent observations confirm a high-demand regime, with Period 17 seeing a significant spike (640). Following that spike, demand has stabilized in a narrower band: Period 18 (419) and Period 19 (439). The mean of the last five periods (Periods 15-19) is approximately 475, though this is skewed by the Period 17 outlier. Excluding the outlier and focusing on the most recent stability (Periods 15, 16, 18, 19), the demand centered around 434. Given the date (June 24) is late June, we expect sustained high demand for summer basics just before potential July clearance cycles. I will forecast a value consistent with the recent post-spike average (approx 430-440).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight summer-relevant basic T-shirt. Analysis of recent demand shows a high-demand regime that was established from Period 11 onwards, generally averaging above 400 units. While Period 17 saw a seasonal peak of 640, demand in Periods 18 and 19 remained stable at 419 and 439 respectively. The sharp drop to 301 in Period 20 (late June) appears to be a deviation from the established summer baseline rather than a permanent downward shift, as July 1st (Period 21) typically marks a strong period for summer apparel. The forecast assumes a recovery from the Period 20 dip toward the stable mean of the last several weeks (excluding the 640 outlier), centering around the 400-410 level.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear peak during late Spring and early Summer (May/June), with demand reaching as high as 640 units in Period 17 (early June). However, the most recent four periods (18-21) show a sharp downward trend: 419, 439, 301, and finally 232 units on July 1st. This suggests the peak summer demand phase has passed, and we are entering a lower mid-summer plateau. Given the drop from 301 to 232 (-23%) last week, and the date being July 8th, demand is expected to stabilize at this lower level rather than continuing a freefall, as basic T-shirts maintain a baseline utility throughout summer. I forecast a slight stabilization/minor recovery from the latest dip.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed: demand has dropped from the early June peak (avg ~487 units in Periods 14-17) to a significantly lower baseline, with the last 2 periods (20-21) averaging 266 units, a ~45% reduction from the summer peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic t-shirt (610776002) has entered a clear downward regime shift as shown in the last three periods (301, 232, 238), significantly lower than the June peak which reached 640. The period ending Period 22 (238 units) confirms that the demand has stabilized at a lower level following the mid-summer peak. Historically, July often sees a tapering off of early-summer wardrobe building. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 22 noted a mean shift to approximately 266 units for the recent window. Given the stability between Period 21 (232) and Period 22 (238), a forecast reflective of this new lower baseline is appropriate. I expect demand to remain relatively flat or slightly recover as mid-summer sales or clearance events might occur, but the immediate trend supports a value in the 235-245 range.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt basic) has entered a clear post-peak decline phase following the early summer highs (June). Recent demand observations show a sustained downward shift: Period 20 (301), Period 21 (232), Period 22 (238), and Period 23 (212). The average of the last three periods (21-23) is approximately 227 units, which is significantly lower than the previous regime. As we move further into late July (2019/7/22), the seasonal relevance of this lightweight jersey T-shirt is beginning to transition from the peak purchasing period to a lower mid-summer baseline. Given the slight downward slope in the most recent periods (238 to 212), I expect the demand to stabilize or slightly soften further toward the 200-210 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand regime confirmed: the last 4 periods (20-23) average 245 units, a 49% decrease from the summer peak average (487 units in Periods 14-17), indicating a return to early spring demand levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical analysis shows this SKU (Womens T-shirt) experienced a significant peak in June (reaching 640 units), which has since entered a sharp decline as summer progresses. The demand has systematically dropped over the last five periods: 301, 232, 238, 212, and 207. According to the carry-over insights from Period 24, a sustained downward regime is confirmed, with the recent 4-period average (245 units) representing a major retraction from the summer peak. The last two periods (212 and 207) suggest a continued slow decay or stabilization at a lower baseline as the peak summer shopping season in late July tapers off. Given the slight week-on-week decline from 212 to 207, I expect demand to remain in the low 200s, likely dipping slightly further as seasonal relevance decreases.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear downwards trend as the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) moves out of the peak summer season (June/July). Period 17 saw a peak of 640 units, but demand has consistently declined since then. The last five periods (21-25) show a downward trajectory: 232, 238, 212, 207, and most recently 154. Period 25 represents a significant drops (-25% from Period 24). As of August 5th, we are transitioning away from high summer demand for basic t-shirts towards late-summer/early-fall patterns. Given the sharp drop in the most recent period (154), the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization or continued minor decline, but weights the most recent slump heavily as it aligns with the established downward regime confirmed in Period 24.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a steep downward trend as the peak summer season concludes. Following the high-demand summer regime (averaging 487 units), demand has dropped sequentially for several weeks, with the most recent three periods showing a sharp acceleration in this decline (154 units in Period 25 and 102 units in Period 26). This represents a 33% drop in the last week alone. Mid-August often aligns with the tail end of summer clearance and a transition in retail assortments. Given the current trajectory and the 'lightweight jersey' nature of the product, I expect a further decline as consumer interest shifts away from summer-specific basics, though the rate of decline may begin to flatten as it approaches the historical baseline observed at the start of the year (training period mean ~205).

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand acceleration: The decline has intensified over the last 3 periods (P24-P26), dropping from 207 to 102 units, signaling a transition out of the peak summer baseline toward a lower late-season baseline (~100-150 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Lightweight T-shirt) shows a clear seasonal lifecycle. Demand peaked in early June (P17: 640 units) and has since been in a steady decline as the summer season concludes. The most recent observations (P25: 154, P26: 102, P27: 120) indicate the product has settled into a low-volume late-summer/early-autumn baseline. The increase from 102 to 120 in the last period is a minor fluctuation within this new downward regime, not a trend reversal. For Period 28 (late August), I expect demand to remain stable within this lower range (100-130 units) as the 'Everyday Basic' nature of the jersey T-shirt provides a small floor for sales even as the primary season ends.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, a basic jersey T-shirt, has completed a significant downward cycle from its summer peak of 640 (P17). After hitting a seasonal trough of 102 units in early August (P26), demand has shown a clear reversal over the last two periods (120 in P27, 158 in P28). This rebound coincides with the late-August Back-to-School season and Labor Day preparations, where everyday basics typically see renewed interest. The growth rate has accelerated from +18 units to +38 units in the most recent observation. I expect this upward momentum to continue as the market transitions out of summer clearance and into the late-season basics demand, targeting a forecast that maintains the recent growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand trough confirmed at Period 26 (102 units); demand has since entered a recovery phase for three consecutive periods (102, 120, 158), averaging 127 units, signaling a shift away from the late-season decline mentioned in Period 27.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization following the late-summer trough at Period 26 (102 units). Since then, demand has fluctuated in a recovery/stabilization phase: Period 27 (120), Period 28 (158), and Period 29 (140), resulting in a 3-period average of 139 units. The current date is September 2nd, 2019, which marks the transition from late summer to early autumn. For basic T-shirts (Womens Everyday Basics), this period often sees a minor 'Back to School' or transitional baseline stability before the colder months set in. The carry-over insight from Period 29 correctly identified the end of the decline. Given the slight dip from 158 to 140 in the most recent period, demand is expected to remain within this established new baseline of 130-150 units as the season transitions.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for the product (Tilly T-shirt). Demand peaked in early June (640 units) and experienced a sustained decline through July and August as the summer season waned. According to 'Carry-over Insights' from Period 29, a late-summer trough was identified at Period 26. Since then, the demand has stabilized and shown minor recovery: the last four periods (P27-P30) have recorded 120, 158, 140, and 145 units respectively, establishing a new late-season baseline mean of approximately 141 units. Entering September (Period 31), the product is in a transition phase; while the back-to-school season might offer marginal support, the transition to cooler autumn weather generally tempers demand for thin jersey t-shirts. Given the high stability in the recent four data points (all between 120-158), I forecast proximity to this recent mean with a slight upward bias following the most recent two-period uptick.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand has shifted from a late-summer decline to a stable late-season baseline, averaging 141 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30) with low variance.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic T-shirt has stabilized following a sharp post-summer decline. Over the last four periods (P28-P31), the demand has settled into a very narrow range (158, 140, 145, 141), establishing a late-season baseline average of approximately 146 units. Period 31 (141 units) shows continued low variance around this mean. As of September 16, there is no significant seasonal driver to suggest a major shift; therefore, the forecast relies on this established recent baseline while accounting for the slight softening seen in the most recent observation.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a year-round basic but shows seasonality. After its summer peak (over 600 units in June), demand stabilized at a late-season baseline. Over the last six periods (P27-P32), demand has been exceptionally stable, averaging 140 units with very low volatility (range 120-158). The most recent three periods (P30-P32) are specifically tight at 145, 141, and 135 units. The current date (late September) typically sees a steady demand for layering basics before any potential holiday lift. Given the high stability of the current regime and the slight downward slope in the last three weeks, a forecast near the recent average is most likely.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for SKU 610776002 (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) shows a clear seasonal cycle. Demand peaked during the Spring/Summer months (reaching 640 units in June) and experienced a significant decline through July and August. Since late August (Period 29), demand has entered a remarkably stable 'post-summer' baseline regime. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has fluctuated within a very narrow range: [140, 145, 141, 135, 147], yielding a mean of 141.6 units. The current date (Sept 30) transitions into Autumn, where this 'Everyday Basic' item typically maintains a consistent low-level baseline before potential winter clearance or holiday shifts. Given the extremely low variance (standard deviation ~4.6 units) and the lack of upcoming major holidays in the immediate week, I expect the demand to remain near the established baseline mean.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees lower demand during the transition from late summer to autumn (October). Historical data shows a clear downward shift from the summer peak (~487 units) to a stabilized late-season baseline (~141 units) established around Period 27. Recently, the demand has shown high stability, averaging 135 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 145, 141, 135, 147, 106). The drop to 106 in Period 34 suggests the onset of a new, lower 'shoulder' season regime as temperatures cool further in October. Given the historical average of 141 established in Period 31 and the most recent dip, I forecast a slight recovery towards the established baseline but moderated by the seasonal cooling trend.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 610776002 (a basic jersey T-shirt) has shown a significant seasonal decline from its early summer peak (avg ~487) to a stable late-season baseline (~141 in Periods 27-31). However, the most recent four periods (P32-P35) show a further deterioration in demand: 135, 147, 106, and 85 units, with the last two periods marking a clear downward break from the previously established baseline of 141 units. As of October 14, 2019, the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) is entering mid-autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, where seasonal demand for basic upper-body jersey layers typically contracts in favor of heavier apparel. The current trend suggests demand is cooling further, having dropped to 85 units. A slight stabilization or continued minor decline is expected as it settles into a winter trough.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Demand has broken below the post-summer baseline of 141 units, with the most recent two periods (P34-P35) averaging 95 units, a 32% decrease from the September stabilization level, reflecting seasonal transition into colder weather.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt in lightweight jersey, which is highly sensitive to seasonal cooling. Historically, demand peaked during the summer (June average ~487) and has been in a sustained decline as autumn progresses. Carry-over insight at Period 36 noted a significant downward shift to a new low baseline, with the last three periods (P34-P36) recording 106, 85, and 84 units respectively (average 92). The current date (Oct 21) marks late autumn/early winter transition where demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts typically bottoms out or maintains a low baseline. Given the stability between the last two periods (85 and 84), I expect demand to remain at this new stabilized lower plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this lightweight t-shirt shows a clear downward shift as we enter late autumn (Period 38, Oct 28). After stabilizing around 141 units in September, demand fell to a new lower baseline in October. Specifically, the last four periods (P34-P37) show demand figures of 106, 85, 84, and 109, respectively, resulting in a new mean of approximately 96 units. The slight uptick in Period 37 (109 units) is likely minor variance or early preparation for mid-season sales rather than a trend reversal, given the cooling temperatures. My forecast expects demand to remain consistent with this recent October mean, accounting for seasonal tapering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 610776002 (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) shows a clear seasonal pattern, peaking during the summer months (Period 17: 640 units) and declining as the weather cools. We are currently in a low-demand regime confirmed at Period 36, where demand dropped from a post-summer baseline of ~141 units to a lower winter-transition baseline. The last five periods (P34-P38) show demand figures of 106, 85, 84, 109, and 78, averaging approximately 92 units. The most recent observation (78 units) reflects continued seasonal weakness as we enter November. There is no evidence of an upward trend; rather, demand is fluctuating within a lower range. Given the recent cluster around the 80-90 unit mark and the lack of upcoming major retail events for this specific week in early November, the forecast is set at 85 units, aligning with the recent 5-period average and stabilizing the downward volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has been in a sustained seasonal decline as we move into late autumn. The average demand in the last baseline (Period 36 carry-over) was 95 units, but the most recent four periods (P36-P39) have shown a further softening, averaging 83 units (84, 109, 78, 61). The demand reached a new low of 61 units in Period 39. Given the early November date (2019/11/11), we are seeing the product reach its seasonal floor. While the trend is downward, demand for 'Everyday Basics' usually stabilizes at a low baseline rather than dropping to zero. Forecast reflects the continued seasonal trough, aligned with recent weekly declines.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand regime confirmed at Period 40: The previous post-summer baseline of 95 units has shifted lower, with the last 5 periods (P35-P39) averaging 83 units, a 13% decline, reflecting late-autumn cooling for this lightweight category.

The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has shown a clear seasonal decline following its summer peak. In the most recent five periods (P36-P40), the demand has averaged approximately 80 units, with a further deceleration into the 60-70 range in the last two weeks (P39: 61, P40: 69). As of November 18, the product is in its winter trough. While Black Friday approaches at the end of the month, demand for lightweight 'Everyday Basics' usually hits a seasonal low at this time. I anticipate the demand will remain stable at this recent lower baseline of approximately 65-70 units before any potential holiday impact in the subsequent period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lightweight T-shirt has stabilized at a low late-autumn baseline, with the last three periods (P39-P41) averaging approximately 66 units (61, 69, 67). However, Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with the week of Black Friday, a major retail event. While the product is a seasonal basic typically in lower demand during cold months, the scheduled promotions and increased consumer traffic associated with Black Friday are expected to drive a significant short-term spike. I anticipate demand will roughly double from the recent baseline, returning to levels seen during the early October transition (Period 31-34), though tempered by the late-November seasonality.

Period 42 (Nov 25) showed a significant increase to 109 units (+63%), coinciding with the Black Friday promotional week. Period 43 (Dec 2) includes Cyber Monday and the start of the December holiday shopping peak. While this is a lightweight item, the 'Everyday Basic' nature typically benefits from holiday volume and layering needs. I expect demand to remain elevated relative to the November baseline due to the Cyber Monday impact and holiday momentum, likely matching or slightly exceeding the Black Friday week performance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is fundamentally counter-seasonal for December. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trajectory as the weather cooled, shifting from a summer peak of ~487 units to a post-summer baseline of ~141 (Period 31), and most recently to a late-autumn baseline of ~83 units (Period 40). Recent demand in the last 4 periods (P40-P43) has averaged 76.5 units. While Period 42 saw a spike to 109 units (likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions), demand immediately corrected back to 61 units in Period 43. Given the current date is December 9th, we are in a pre-holiday clearance/lull period where lightweight basics typically underperform unless driven by deep discounts. I expect demand to remain low, consistent with the non-promotional baseline seen in Period 43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is fundamentally sensitive to seasonal changes. Recent demand data shows a clear downward trajectory as winter approaches, following the 'Period 40' carry-over insight which identified a shift to a lower baseline (~83 units). Over the last five periods (P40-P44), the average demand has dropped further to 72.2 units. The last two periods (P43 and P44) saw demand dip to 61 and 55 units respectively. Given the date (December 16), we are entering the peak of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, which is seasonally unfavorable for lightweight basics. While there is a slight possibility of a minor pre-holiday uptick in general retail, this specific category (Women's Everyday Basics - T-shirt) is likely to continue its seasonal decline or remain at its recent low floor. I expect demand to remain near the recent low levels of 55-60.

Carry-over insight: Sustained winter baseline established at Period 45: The late-autumn baseline of 83 units has shifted lower as of Period 44, with the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44) averaging 72 units and the most recent 2 periods averaging 58 units, reflecting minimum seasonal demand for this lightweight category.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this lightweight T-shirt follows a heavy seasonal trend, declining from over 600 units in summer to a current winter floor. Over the last 6 periods (P40-P45), demand has stabilized around a mean of 70.8. Excluding a singular outlier in P42 (likely promotional), the most recent three weeks (P43-P45) show a tight range between 55 and 64 units, averaging ~60 units. As Period 46 falls on the week of Christmas (2019/12/23), demand for lightweight basics typically remains at its seasonal minimum due to the cold weather, with little reason for a significant shift before the post-holiday sales period starts to register in late December data.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a significant seasonal decline from summer peaks (>400 units) to a winter baseline (~60-70 units). Recently, demand reached a seasonal floor of 55 units in Period 44. However, Period 46 (Dec 23) saw a significant uptick to 92 units, likely driven by holiday shopping. Period 47 (Dec 30) typically captures post-Christmas clearance sales and New Year's retail traffic. While demand usually drops in early January, the momentum from the holiday week and ongoing sales suggest demand will remain above the mid-winter baseline but slightly lower than the immediate Christmas peak.
