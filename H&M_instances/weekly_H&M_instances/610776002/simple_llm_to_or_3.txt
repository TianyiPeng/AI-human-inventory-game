SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis: The last five periods show a strong upward trend (148 -> 175 -> 160 -> 233 -> 308), indicating a shift from a baseline of ~160 to over 300. Seasonal/Product context: The product is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a core basic for Women's Everyday category. Current date is Feb 11, moving into the spring fashion transition in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand spikes at the end of the history suggest early spring/basic restocking. Trend analysis: The most recent data point (308) is nearly double the early baseline, suggesting a strong growth momentum leading into the warmer months. Forecast logic: Given the steep recent growth but the potential for a stabilization after a jump, I predict a slight continuation of the trend to 320.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Demand increased from a baseline of ~160 to >300 (+87%) over the last 5 periods, marking a transition into the spring season.

Predicted demand: 320 units

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend from 148 to 308. In Period 1 (test phase), demand was 266 units, which is a slight decrease from the previous peak of 308 but remains significantly above the early historical baseline (avg 161). The current date is February 18, 2019. Being a staple 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt, demand is likely influenced by the early spring transition. Given the slight dip from 308 to 266, I anticipate a consolidatory phase where demand stabilizes slightly below the recent peak but stays within the new high-demand regime established in late winter/early spring.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a seasonal basic typically seeing increased demand as spring approaches. Historical training data showed an upward trajectory peaking at 308. Observed demand in the test phase confirms this high-demand regime, with Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316) maintaining the level established at the end of the training data (average ~291). Period 2 shows a 19% increase over Period 1. Given the date (late February) and the upward momentum of this 'everyday basic' as warmer weather nears, a slight further increase is expected as the spring transition continues.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt grew from a baseline of ~160 to over 300, as noted in the carry-over insights. During the test phase (Periods 1-3), demand has stabilized at a high level: 266, 316, and 306 units respectively. The average demand over these three recent periods is approximately 296. Given that the current date (March 4th) is the beginning of the spring season for a 'lightweight jersey' basic, demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase as temperatures rise and spring shopping peaks. The trend indicates a stable high-demand regime following the initial surge.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (148-308) and recent test data (266-316) show a clear upward shift in demand for this basic t-shirt compared to early February. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal relevance as the northern hemisphere moves into spring (March). Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~293 units over the last four periods (266, 316, 306, 283). Period 4 showed a slight dip to 283, but given the date (March 11) and the product type, demand is expected to remain firm or slightly recover as the weather warms. I forecast a demand level consistent with the recent four-week average, slightly adjusting for the ongoing spring transition.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt during the training phase (starting Feb 2018) showed an average of ~160, which significantly increased to ~308 by the end of training. In the current test phase (starting mid-Feb 2019), the demand began at 266 and peaked at 316. However, for the last three periods (Periods 3, 4, 5), there has been a steady week-over-week decline: 306 -> 283 -> 252. This suggests a deceleration in early spring demand after an initial pre-season surge. As the current date (March 18) approaches late March, demand typically stabilizes or continues slight adjustments before the true warm-weather peak. Given the current downward trend over the last 3 weeks (averaging a loss of ~27 units per week), I expect a further slight cooling to around 235 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically sees increased demand as weather warms in spring. Historical training data showed an increase from ~160 to ~308. In the current test phase (Periods 1-6), the demand stabilized around a higher mean, averaging approximately 282 units. Recent periods (4-6) show a slight cooling from the initial peak in Period 2 (316) but have stabilized in the 250-280 range. For Period 7 (March 25), we are entering the peak spring season. Given the slight recovery in Period 6 (270 from 252), I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase as April approaches.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an increase toward the end of the period (peak 308). In the test phase (Periods 1-7), demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 294 units. A significant spike occurred in Period 7 (364 units) as the calendar moved into late March. As of Period 8 (April 1st), we are entering the peak spring season for 'Everyday Basics' like this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Given the strong upward momentum in the most recent observation and the seasonal relevance of the product in early April, the forecast anticipates demand will remain elevated, slightly moderating from the immediate spike but staying well above the established mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt started at ~160 (training) and shifted to a baseline of ~280-300 in February/early March. In the most recent two periods (7 and 8), demand surged to 364 and 372 units respectively. This aligns with the transition into early April, where warmer weather typically drives demand for lightweight jersey basics. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, which is highly sensitive to spring seasonality. Given the consistent increase over the last two weeks, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or slightly higher as the spring season gains momentum.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward shift confirmed starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~280 to ~370 (+32%), reflecting peak spring demand for basic T-shirts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU (Womens Everyday Basics) showed a significant increase starting in late March (Period 7), consistent with the 'spring peak' identified in carry-over insights. Recent demand levels were 364 (P7), 372 (P8), and 271 (P9). The drop in Period 9 (2019/4/8) likely reflects a post-peak correction or a temporary volatility, as the demand is still high relative to the early-year baseline of ~160. Given the current date is 2019/4/15, we are in the heart of the spring shopping season. While P9 saw a dip, the average of the last three periods is approximately 336. I expect demand to stabilize between the high of P8 and the dip of P9 as temperatures rise further.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU shows a clear increase as we moved into spring (March/April). After the initial regime shift to ~270-300 in February/early March, demand peaked in Periods 7 and 8 (late March/early April) at ~360-370 units. Recent weeks (Periods 9 and 10) show a slight cooling from those peak highs, averaging ~290. We are currently in late April (2019/4/22), which is typically a strong period for lightweight basic T-shirts. Period 10 (310) showed a recovery from Period 9 (271). Given the seasonal relevance of a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey' during late spring, it is expected that demand will stabilize around the current 300-310 range rather than returning to the ~370 peaks or falling back to the ~260 levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a baseline shift occurred around Period 7, moving from an average of ~280 units to a higher range. Recent performance (Periods 7-11) has averaged 376 units. However, Period 11 (2019/4/22) showed a massive spike to 564 units (+82% over the previous period), which coincides with the week leading into the Easter Monday (April 22) and the final run-up to May Day and warmer spring weather. While the 564 is an outlier, it represents a momentum shift into the late spring season. Period 12 (April 29) traditionally sees a slight 'post-holiday' cooling compared to a peak holiday week, but remains high due to seasonal relevance of a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt'. I expect demand to regress toward the new high-mean but stay elevated compared to early April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal progression for this basic T-shirt. Initial demand (Periods 1-6) averaged ~282 units. A shift occurred in Period 7, raising the baseline to ~330-370. Recent data shows a massive spike in Period 11 (564 units) and Period 12 (424 units), coinciding with late April/early May. This surge is likely driven by 'May Day' public holiday shopping and the transition into warmer late-spring/early-summer temperatures. While demand eased from the 564 peak back to 424, it remains significantly elevated compared to the March/early April baseline. Forecast for Period 13 (May 6) anticipates a continued cooling from the holiday peak but maintaining a high seasonal baseline as summer approaches.

Carry-over insight: Late spring surge confirmed: Demand spiked by over 50% in late April (Periods 11-12), establishing a new seasonal high-water mark above 400 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt shows a clear seasonal pattern related to the transition from spring to summer. After a significant surge in late April (Periods 11 and 12, likely driven by Easter and early warm-weather shopping), demand has mean-reverted in Period 13 back to the 'pre-surge' levels observed in early April (Period 9/10). Current demand at 304 units remains significantly higher than the initial February baseline (~260-300), but indicates the volatility of the peak has subsided. For Period 14 (mid-May), demand is expected to remain stable near the current baseline as summer temperatures begin to sustain consistent sales for 'Everyday Basics', though we anticipate a slight cooling effect following the post-surge drop before stabilizing for the summer peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear upward trend as we move further into the spring and early summer season for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Periods 11-12 saw a massive surge (564 and 424 units), likely tied to late April promotions or weather shifts. While Period 13 dipped to 304, Period 14 rebounded strongly to 431 units. The current date is May 20, 2019, entering the peak summer shopping window. Given the average of the last four periods is approximately 430 units and the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has high seasonal relevance in late May, a maintains of this higher demand level is expected. I will forecast a slight continuation of the strong Period 14 performance.

Carry-over insight: Consistent demand volatility observed in May: Period 11-14 average is ~430 units, establishing a high-demand regime for late spring compared to the Period 7-10 average of ~330.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown a clear seasonal climb from February into May. Looking at the recent periods (Period 11-15), demand has surged significantly, averaging approximately 433 units. While Period 11 was an outlier (564), the last two periods (14 and 15) have shown stability in the mid-400s (431 and 442). Period 16 (May 27, 2019) coincides with the US Memorial Day holiday, which typically signals the unofficial start of summer and often triggers retail sales or increased shopping for lightweight jersey basics. Given the upward trajectory and the seasonal relevance of the product, I expect demand to remain strong or slightly increase from last week's level.

Carry-over insight: Late May stabilization: Demand has maintained a new plateau between 430-450 units over the last two periods (14-15), confirming the high-demand regime identified in Period 15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt has shown a significant seasonal progression. After an initial spring surge in late March (Periods 7-8) and a volatile April including a massive spike in Period 11 (564 units), the demand has stabilized into a very consistent high-demand regime throughout late May. Specifically, the last three periods (14, 15, and 16) have recorded 431, 442, and 435 units respectively, indicating a tight plateau with a mean of ~436 and low variance. Moving into the first week of June (Period 17), there is no evidence of a downward shift yet as summer basics typically maintain high demand. Therefore, I am forecasting a continuation of this stable high-level demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt has shown a significant upward trajectory as the season moves from spring into early summer. Recent weeks (Period 14-16) established a steady high-demand plateau around 430-440 units. However, Period 17 (June 3) saw a massive spike to 640 units (+47% vs. previous 3-week average). This spike likely corresponds to the 'June 1' effect or early June summer sales/payday cycles often seen in retail. Looking at the trend, while 640 is a peak, the transition into mid-June (Period 18) usually sees a slight cooling off from the initial monthly peak while remaining well above the May baseline. I expect demand to regress toward a slightly higher mean than May, reflecting sustained summer interest.

Carry-over insight: Early June demand surge: Period 17 demand (640) represents a 45% increase over the May plateau (~440), signaling the start of peak summer demand levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a series of upward regime shifts as the season transitions from spring to summer. The most recent established plateau was between 430-450 units (Periods 14-16). Period 17 saw a major spike to 640 units (early June), which then corrected to 419 in Period 18. This correction suggests the 640 might have been an outlier or a concentrated seasonal peak (possibly early summer shopping or Father's Day proximity), while 419 aligns closely with the pre-surge plateau. As we move further into mid-June (Current Date 2019/6/17), demand for this lightweight t-shirt is expected to remain high due to peak summer seasonality. I forecast demand to remain stable near the established high-demand regime of ~430-450 units, weighting the most recent observation of 419 heavily as a return to normal seasonal levels following the spike.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt shows a clear transition from a spring average of ~330 to a summer high-demand regime. The 'Early June surge' (Period 17: 640 units) was an outlier or a temporary spike, as demand has since reverted to a stable plateau. Specifically, Periods 18 (419) and 19 (439) align closely with the high-demand stabilization level observed in mid-to-late May (~430-450). Given the current date (June 24), we are in peak summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand is expected to remain consistent with this established plateau rather than repeating the specific outlier spike seen in early June.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer stabilization confirmed: Periods 18-19 (avg ~430) show demand returning to the late-May plateau after the Period 17 surge, establishing a consistent summer baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has been operating in a summer high-demand regime, generally plateauing between 419 and 442 units outside of specific surges. However, Period 20 (late June) shows a sharp decline to 301 units. This drop mirrors previous transitory dips seen in Period 9 (271) and Period 13 (304), which were followed by immediate recoveries. Given that the current date is July 1st, we are entering peak summer months for a jersey T-shirt. The drop in Period 20 is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a regime shift, as the carry-over insights previously established a consistent summer baseline around 430 units. I expect demand to regress toward this established summer mean.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal transition. The product (lightweight basic T-shirt) saw peak demand in late spring and early summer (Periods 11-19), frequently exceeding 400 units and peaking at 640. However, a significant downward shift has occurred over the last two periods (Period 20: 301, Period 21: 232). This represents a decline of approximately 50% from the June plateau (~440). As we move into July, this likely indicates a 'mid-summer dip' where primary seasonal purchasing has concluded, or a transition out of the peak jersey-basic demand phase. The demand has dropped below the early spring baseline (~250-300). I expect demand to stabilize around this new lower level or continue a slight downward trend as the peak season passes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift: Demand declined significantly in Periods 20-21, dropping from a ~440 peak summer plateau to an average of ~265 (-40%), signaling the end of the peak seasonal surge.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt) has entered a post-peak summer cooling phase. Analysis of recent demand shows a significant drop from the May/June plateau of ~440 units to a new lower regime. Period 20 recorded 301, Period 21 recorded 232, and Period 22 recorded 238. This indicates a stabilization around the mid-230s following the mid-summer demand shift identified in the carry-over insights. Historically (Periods 1-6), the pre-spring baseline was around 280, suggesting that current demand has returned to or slightly below that early-year baseline as the primary summer buying season for basic lightweight jersey T-shirts concludes in July. I expect Period 23 to remain stable at this new lower level.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-23) shows a significant and sustained contraction, averaging ~227 units compared to the previous plateau of ~430. This confirms a bearish trend following the mid-summer peak. The product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is entering late July (2019/7/22), a period typically seeing a transition from peak summer peaks toward late-summer clearance or pre-autumn patterns. Specifically, the last three periods (232, 238, 212) indicate the demand has stabilized at a lower level (~230). Period 23 was the lowest since the training phase at 212. I expect the next period to remain consistent with this new lower-demand regime, with a slight continued downward pressure.

Carry-over insight: New lower-demand regime confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~227 units over Periods 21-23, a 48% decrease from the early June peak plateau of ~440.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) shows a clear stabilization into a lower-demand regime following the mid-summer peak. Observations from the last four periods (21-24) show demand ranging between 207 and 238 units, with an average of approximately 222 units. Period 24 (207 units) is the lowest in this sequence, continuing a slight downward drift. As we are now in late July (2019/7/29), we are moving past the peak summer buying season for basic lightweight jersey T-shirts. Given the high stability in this new range (207-238) and the slight negative momentum over the last two weeks, I expect demand to remain within this established baseline, likely toward the lower end of the recent average.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant downward trend following the mid-summer peak. Since the regime shift identified in Period 22, demand has transitioned from a plateau of ~440 units to a much lower baseline. Over the most recent five periods (Periods 21-25), demand has steadily declined from 232 down to 154. The last observed demand (Period 25: 154) represents a 25% drop from the Period 21-24 average (~222). As we move into August, seasonal demand for this basic lightweight T-shirt is cooling off significantly. Given the consistent weekly decline over the last three periods (212 -> 207 -> 154), a further reduction is expected as the late-summer clearance/off-season shift continues.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer decline confirmed: Demand has dropped below the ~227 regime identified in Period 24, with Period 25 (154) marking a new post-peak low, down ~30% from the July average.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant seasonal decline for this basic T-shirt as summer begins to wind down. Following a peak in early June (640 units), demand entered a lower regime of ~220 units in July. In the most recent periods (25 and 26), demand has plummeted from 154 to 102 units. This aligns with late-summer clearance and a shift in consumer focus away from lightweight jersey basics. Given the current date of August 12, the trend suggests a continue downward trajectory or a floor-seeking stabilization. The drop from Period 25 to 26 was approximately 34%. Expecting a slightly moderated continuation of this decline as demand approaches a low-season baseline.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer transition confirmed: Demand has dropped for 6 consecutive periods, falling from a ~220 plateau in July to ~102 by early August, representing a >50% reduction in four weeks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has followed a predictable seasonal arc, peaking in June (Period 17) and experiencing a sharp, sustained decline throughout July and early August as the summer season ends. After dropping for six consecutive periods to a low of 102 (Period 26), Period 27 showed a slight uptick to 120. This indicates the demand is beginning to bottom out and stabilize at a late-summer/pre-fall baseline. Given the historical trend of this item as an 'Everyday Basic,' demand is expected to consolidate around this lower regime (110-130 units) rather than continuing the steep decline seen in previous weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product (a basic summer T-shirt) peaked in June (~440-640 units) and has been in a sustained seasonal decline through July and August. After reaching a low of 102 units in Period 26, demand has shown a slight recovery over the last two weeks (120 in Period 27, 158 in Period 28). This suggests the dramatic 'end-of-summer' drop-off has bottomed out, and demand is stabilizing at a new late-summer baseline. Given the current date of August 26, we are entering the transition to autumn where basic jersey tops often see a minor 'back-to-school' or layering utility bounce. The recent trend indicates an upward movement from the 100-120 range toward 160. I expect this stabilization/slight growth to continue into the next period.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization after late-summer decline: Demand has bottomed out at ~100 units in early August and is trending upward (avg ~140 over last 2 periods), signaling a new late-season baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for the 'Tilly' t-shirt. After a significant peak in early June (640 units) and a summer plateau (~440 units), demand underwent a steep decline throughout July and August as the primary t-shirt season ended. The record shows demand bottoming out at 102 units in early August before stabilizing. Over the last four periods (26-29), demand has averaged approximately 130 units (102, 120, 158, 140), indicating a new, lower baseline for the late summer/early autumn transition. The current date (Sept 2) marks the Labor Day period in many regions, which often sees a small, final push for t-shirts/basics before autumnal weather sets in. Given the recent stabilization between 120-158 units, I expect demand to remain within this established late-season range with a slight bias toward the recent average.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand has established a new secondary baseline of ~130 units over Periods 26-29, following the steep decline from the June/July summer highs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant seasonal lifecycle for this basic T-shirt. After a peak summer volume (Period 17: 640), demand steadily declined through July and August. Recent carry-over insights and observations confirm that demand has stabilized at a new post-summer baseline. Specifically, over the last five periods (Periods 26-30), demand has averaged 133 units, exhibiting low volatility (range 102 to 158). The current date is September 9th, signifying the start of the Autumn retail season. Given that this is an 'Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt, it is likely to maintain a consistent secondary baseline as a layering piece, rather than continuing to fall. Recent demand over the last three weeks (158, 140, 145) suggests a stabilized plateau. I forecast demand to remain steady around this level.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 28-31) shows a clear stabilization following the end-of-summer decline, with weekly demand values of 158, 140, 145, and 141. The average over these four periods is approximately 146 units, establishing a new, consistent baseline for the early autumn season. As this product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' lightweight jersey T-shirt, demand is expected to remain steady at this lower level as it transitions from a standalone summer item to a layering basic for autumn. There is no evidence of a significant trend or upcoming holiday spike at this specific date (Sept 16), suggesting the current plateau will persist.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn stabilization: Demand has established a consistent new baseline of ~145 units over Periods 28-31, effectively ending the sharp decline observed in August.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has stabilized following the end-of-summer decline. Over the last five periods (Period 28-32), the demand has consistently hovered between 135 and 158 units, with an average of approximately 144 units. Specifically, the last three periods (145, 141, 135) show a very tight range with a minor downward drift. Given the date (September 23), we are firmly in early autumn, a period where basic jersey t-shirts typically maintain a steady, lower baseline compared to summer peaks. There are no immediate major retail holidays in the final week of September that would drive a significant spike. Therefore, I anticipate the demand will remain within the recently established baseline of ~140 units, likely continuing the slight softening seen in Period 32.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline confirmed: Demand has maintained a consistent average of ~140 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 28-32), establishing a stable post-summer regime.

Predicted demand: 138 units

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a basic lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal cycle: a spring/summer peak followed by a significant decline throughout August. Recent demand from Periods 28 to 33 has stabilized significantly, forming a tight horizontal range between 135 and 158 units. Specifically, the last six periods (covering late August through late September) have an average of 144 units with very low variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 8). Period 33 demand was 147 units. Given the transition into late September and early October, where demand for lightweight basic layering items typically holds steady before the winter drop, I expect the established autumn baseline of ~140-150 to persist. There are no immediate seasonal drivers or trend changes suggesting a deviation from this mean.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the SKU '610776002' (a jersey basic t-shirt) has transited from its summer peak (over 400-600 units) into a low-demand autumn baseline. Periods 28 through 33 demonstrated a very stable regime with an average demand of approximately 144 units. However, Period 34 (106 units) shows a significant 28% drop from the previous week and represents the lowest demand since early August (Period 26). This decline aligns with the cooling weather in early October for the 'Upper body | T-shirt' category, which typically sees reduced demand as consumers shift to heavier garments. Given the break below the previously established 140s baseline, I expect demand to either stabilize at this lower level or continue a slight seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: New lower autumn baseline detected: Demand broke the ~140 unit stabilization regime in Period 34 (106 units), suggesting a transition to a late-autumn low of ~110 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has shown a clear downward trend as the product enters the autumn/winter season. While it maintained a baseline of ~140 units from mid-August through September (Periods 28-33), the last two periods have seen a significant reduction: Period 34 (106) and Period 35 (85), representing a drop of ~40% from the previous baseline. This decline aligns with the product's classification as a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt,' which loses seasonal relevance in October. Given the two-period consistent drop, I expect demand to continue at this lower level or slightly decline further as temperatures drop.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-autumn demand decline: Average demand dropped from a stable ~140 units (Periods 28-33) to ~95 units (Periods 34-35), a decrease of ~32% marking the transition to off-season lows.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a clear shift into a late-autumn low-demand regime for this basic t-shirt. After stabilizing around 140 units from late August through September (Periods 28-33), demand experienced a significant drop starting in Period 34. The last three periods (Periods 34-36) have recorded demands of 106, 85, and 84 units respectively. This represents a confirmed transition from the autumn baseline to an off-season floor. Given the stability between Period 35 and 36 (85 and 84 units), the demand appears to have found a new temporary bottom as weather continues to cool in late October. Therefore, the forecast for Period 37 anticipates continued stability at this lower level.

Carry-over insight: New off-season baseline established: Demand has stabilized at ~85 units over Periods 35-36, a 40% decrease from the September baseline of ~140 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 610776002 (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) shows a clear seasonal pattern, peaking in June and steadily declining through autumn. Most recently, the demand has transitioned from a stable September baseline of ~140 units to a significantly lower off-season regime. Periods 35 and 36 showed a floor around 84-85 units, while Period 37 (2019/10/21) saw a slight uptick to 109 units. This uptick likely represents a minor fluctuation rather than a trend reversal, as late October in the fashion retail calendar for lightweight summer basics typically continues into a low-demand phase. The forecast projects demand to remain within the established off-season range of 85-110 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has entered its off-season phase as of late October/early November. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the summer peak (640 units) and early autumn baseline (~140 units) to a current low-regime. Analysis of the most recent four periods (P35-P38) shows demand levels of 85, 84, 109, and 78, creating a new off-season average of approximately 89 units. The Period 37 spike to 109 appears to be a minor fluctuation rather than a trend reversal. For Period 39 (beginning 2019/11/4), demand is expected to remain within this established 75-95 unit range, as there are no major retail events in early November likely to drive a spike for a lightweight jersey basic.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Demand for this basic T-shirt has continued its seasonal decline as it enters the mid-November period. Historical data shows a clear downward trajectory from the late-autumn baseline of ~140 units down to the current off-season lows. The most recent three periods (109, 78, 61) indicate that demand is still finding its floor. With the current date of November 11th, there is no evidence of a promotional spike for this basic SKU, and the trend suggests a further slight softening or stabilization at this low volume before the winter plateau.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal decline from summer peaks (~640) to an off-season baseline. Over the last six periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged approximately 78 units, with the most recent two weeks (P39-P40) bottoming out at 61 and 69 units respectively. Period 41 (week of 2019/11/18) precedes the Black Friday period. While the product is a winter off-season basic t-shirt, we anticipate a slight uptick in demand due to early 'Black Week' promotions and holiday shopping traffic starting to build. Given the recent stabilization between 60-70, a modest increase is expected before the primary spike in the following period.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization at off-season floor confirmed: Demand has averaged ~70 units over the last three periods (P38-P40), establishing a winter baseline for this basic jersey item.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows the demand has stabilized at an off-season 'winter floor' over the last four periods (avg ~69 units). However, the current period (Period 42) begins on November 25, 2019, which is the week of Black Friday (November 29). For a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt, major retail events like Black Friday typically trigger a significant short-term demand spike as consumers take advantage of site-wide promotions and holiday sales. Comparing historical seasonal shifts for this SKU (e.g., the 50-80% surges seen in Spring/Summer), I anticipate a substantial lift from the current baseline. I am forecasting a nearly twofold increase from the recent floor to account for the peak holiday shopping week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a lightweight basic jersey T-shirt, which typically experiences peak demand in spring/summer and lower demand in autumn/winter. Historical demand confirms this, having declined from a summer peak (~440-640 units) to a stable winter floor of ~70 units (Periods 39-41). However, Period 42 (Nov 25) showed a significant jump to 109 units (+63% from the previous 3-period average). This aligns with the 'Black Friday' weekend (Nov 29, 2019) and the start of the holiday shopping season. Given that Period 43 (Dec 2) includes 'Cyber Monday' and the first full week of December, demand is expected to remain elevated compared to the November floor but likely peak slightly lower or maintain the momentum of the initial holiday surge as gift-buying for basics continues.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a clear seasonal pattern, peaking significantly in late spring and early summer (up to 640 units) and declining through the autumn and winter months. Recent demand (Periods 39-43) has established an off-season floor, averaging approximately 73 units. While Period 42 showed a temporary lift to 109 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact on November 25th), Period 43 immediately returned to the low-demand baseline of 61 units. For Period 44 (December 9th), demand is expected to remain consistent with this winter baseline of ~60-75 units, as this basic layering item is not a primary driver for holiday-specific gift shopping compared to seasonal fashion or outerwear.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has entered its secondary winter low. Following the seasonal decline from autumn, demand stabilized around 70 units (Periods 38-41). A brief spike in Period 42 (109 units) aligns with late-November retail events (Black Friday), but demand immediately returned to a lower baseline in Periods 43 and 44 (61 and 55 units respectively). Given the current date of December 16th, which is off-peak for summer basics, the forecast anticipates demand will remain at this winter floor, slightly below the previous 70-unit average as consumers prioritize holiday-specific purchases over everyday basics.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '610776002' (a basic jersey T-shirt) is currently in its off-season winter floor. Over the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has stabilized at a low average of 60 units (61, 55, 64), following a brief spike during the late November promotional period (P42: 109). As of December 23rd (Period 46), the retail environment is dominated by holiday shopping, but basic t-shirts typically do not see significant seasonal surges in winter compared to their peak spring/summer performance. Therefore, I expect the demand to remain consistent with the recently established baseline of ~60-65 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a winter low-demand regime, previously identified as having a baseline of approximately 70 units. Recent performance in December shows a floor of 55-64 units (Periods 43-45), with holiday-related spikes in Period 42 (109) and Period 46 (92). Period 47 covers the week of December 30 (New Year's), which typically sees a slight tapering of demand from the Christmas peak but remains elevated compared to the mid-December floor due to holiday clearance and gift card spending. I expect demand to settle between the winter baseline and the recent Christmas spike.
