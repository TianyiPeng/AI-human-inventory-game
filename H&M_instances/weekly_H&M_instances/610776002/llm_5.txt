Historical demand samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] average 204.8 units per period, but show a significant upward trend toward the end. Given it's early February, we are approaching the spring season in the Northern Hemisphere, where demand for lightweight jersey basics typically increases. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period (Period 1). Since there is 0 on-hand inventory and the last historical sample was 308, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for this period plus a safety buffer to avoid stockouts on a high-velocity item. I will target a stock level slightly above the recent peak (308) to account for the seasonal uptrend and potential variability.",
