Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt). The current date is 2019/02/11. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend (148, 175, 160, 233, 308), likely indicating a seasonal ramp-up as we move towards spring. The promised lead time is 0. Since we start with 0 inventory (on-hand + in-transit), we must place an order immediately. Given the strong upward trend, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent spike (avg ~233) rather than the long-term average (~204). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected high demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Tilly (1)', a women's everyday basic T-shirt. The historical record shows demand for the last 6 periods as [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266]. There is a visible upward trend starting from Period 4 (233, 308, 266), suggesting a shift in demand regime compared to the earlier samples (148-175). The item is a basic jersey T-shirt, and demand often starts to rise in February/March as spring approaches. The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 30), and since L=0, the order placed this period will arrive in time to satisfy this period's demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand spike, while keeping L as default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Over the last 7 weeks (including pre-game history), demand has shown a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308 (pre-game) followed by 266 and 316 (game history). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 296, significantly higher than the overall historical mean of 229. Promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time for Periods 1 and 2 was confirmed as 0. Period 2 ended with 0 inventory and unmet demand (lost sales), as demand (316) exceeded available stock (301). I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent growth in demand and set L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand has increased from an early average of ~160 to a recent average of ~297 over the last 3 weeks (Periods 1, 2, and the final pre-game week).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, a basic garment likely to see increasing demand as spring approaches (current date March 4). Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308 (pre-game to P1). Actual demand in game has been 266, 316, and 306. The mean demand of the last 4 periods (P1-P3 plus the last pre-game week) is approximately 297.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived immediately). However, in Period 2, we experienced a stockout (sold 301 on demand of 316), indicating the need for a slightly higher safety stock. I will use the recent 4 periods to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: avg increased from ~160 to ~300. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1097.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's t-shirt entering March, a period where spring demand for basics typically stabilizes at a higher level than winter. Since the regime shift identified at Period 1 (moving from ~160 to ~300), demand has been consistently high: 266, 316, 306, and 283 (average of 292.75 over 4 periods). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 35. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the mean (~293) and standard deviation of this higher-demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected 280-310 units per period while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility (\u03c3 ~ 22).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's layering basic (T-shirt), and we are in mid-March. Historically, demand shifted from a pre-game average of ~160 to a stable higher regime averaging ~285 across the last five periods (266, 316, 306, 283, 252). There is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, but it remains significantly higher than the initial pre-game levels. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and its volatility (std ~25), while staying responsive to the slight recent cooling. Setting L to 'default' as promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current date is March 25th, transitioning into the spring season when demand for light jersey basics typically remains stable or increases. Since Period 1, demand has shifted from an early average of ~160 to a steady higher regime. Looking at the last 6 periods of the game (P1-P6), demand has been [266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270], with a mean of ~282. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1-P6) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently low (38 units) with no in-transit units because L=0. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current demand regime and its volatility (std dev ~22), which provides a stable baseline for the backend OR engine to compute the order for the upcoming period while maintaining a high service level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's t-shirt (everyday basic). The current date is April 1st. Historically, demand for lightweight jersey basics often begins to rise in early spring. Recent data shows a significant jump in demand in Period 7 (364 units), which exceeded the available stock and current supply parameters. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all 7 concluded cycles. Given the recent stockout and the upward trend in demand (last 3 periods: 252, 270, 364), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this growth. This N=4 includes the jump to 364 and the preceding stable periods to avoid overreacting while acknowledging the stockout signal. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen in the latest week. This approach balances the service level to prevent further stockouts during the spring transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed in late March/early April (Period 7 demand: 364 vs previous average ~270), likely seasonally driven for lightweight t-shirts. Actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1336.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight t-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal demand period in April. Historical demand shows a clear upward shift starting in Period 7 (364 units) and Period 8 (372 units), compared to the earlier average of ~280. Demand has exceeded supply for two consecutive periods, resulting in stockouts (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this seasonal ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (Periods 6, 7, and 8 average: 335.3 units). Given the stockout situation and increasing demand, I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat, setting it higher (60) than the recent standard deviation to provide a buffer for the expected peak season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand spike confirmed: Demand has averaged ~368 over the last two weeks (Periods 7-8), a ~30% increase over the previous 6-week average of ~282.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th, and we are managing a lightweight t-shirt, which is entering a seasonal high as weather warms. Demand has been high in recent weeks (P7: 364, P8: 372), though P9 saw a dip to 271. The 3-period average is approximately 336. Given the stockouts in P7 and P8, a robust inventory position is needed. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in the latest period. This approach ensures the base stock reflects recent seasonal levels rather than the lower late-winter averages.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is seasonally relevant for the current date (April 22). Historically, demand spiked in Late March/Early April (Periods 7 and 8) reaching ~368, but has since stabilized around ~290 in the last two weeks (Periods 9 and 10). The average demand across these 4 most recent 'spring' periods (7-10) is 329.25. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The current on-hand inventory is 73. Using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this high-demand spring regime while smoothing out the extreme peak from Period 8 and the dip in Period 9. The service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which is relatively high, so protecting against stockouts with recent volatility (sigma_hat) is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime confirmed for Periods 7-10: Average demand is 329, significantly higher than the early-year average of ~270. Volatility increased during this period (StdDev ~47).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) experienced a major demand surge in Period 11 (demand=564), significantly exceeding the recent Spring average of ~329. This spike occurred in late April (2019/4/22), likely corresponding to a pre-summer seasonal peak or a specific promotional event. Starting Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit units makes us vulnerable to stockouts if this high demand persists. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent volatility and the significant upward shift in demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the Spring regime while heavily weighting the recent outsized demand of 564, allowing the OR engine to set a higher base stock level to mitigate future stockouts while acknowledging the increased variance (std dev for these 5 periods is ~114).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surge detected at Period 11: Single-period demand reached 564 (+70% vs recent Spring average), signaling a potential seasonal peak for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak seasonal window (May). Demand has shifted significantly over the last two periods, moving from a spring average of ~330 to much higher levels: 564 in Period 11 and 424 in Period 12. This suggests we are in a 'high-summer' demand regime. The previous spring average is no longer representative of the current peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the average of the last two spikes (494), while using a larger window for sigma_hat (recent_N=6) to ensure the OR model accounts for the high volatility seen throughout the spring and transition into summer. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. The current on-hand inventory of 48 is very low given the recent demand levels, so the OR backend will trigger a substantial order to meet this high baseline.

Carry-over insight: Peak season regime confirmed at Period 12: Demand in the last two weeks (Periods 11-12) averaged 494, a ~50% increase over the early spring average of ~330.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 falls in mid-May (2019/05/13). Historically, this SKU (lightweight jersey t-shirt) experienced a demand peak in late April/early May (Periods 11-12: demand 564, 424). Period 13 saw a significant drop to 304, falling back to pre-peak spring levels (~330). This suggest the peak seasonal surge has passed or is stabilizing. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the recent seasonal regime (Periods 7-13) to set parameters. The average demand over these last 7 weeks is ~372, but since the most recent demand was 304, I'll use N=3 (averaging 564, 424, 304 = 430) for mu_hat to remain cautious of high volatility while reflecting a likely cooling trend. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=7 to capture the higher volatility observed throughout the peak spring transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling detected at Period 13: Demand dropped to 304 after an average of 494 in Periods 11-12, suggesting the primary May seasonal peak for lightweight jersey basics is tapering.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant peak in late April/early May (Periods 11-12, demand avg ~494) followed by a cooling to ~304 in Period 13 and a rebound to 431 in Period 14. This volatility suggests we are in a 'Post-Peak' regime where demand remains higher than early spring (avg ~330) but is stabilizing. To capture this, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (Periods 12-14) to reflect the recent high-volume but inconsistent pattern, resulting in a mean of ~386. Lead time remains consistently 0. Using recent_N for sigma ensures we account for high recent variance (StdDev ~65) to maintain service levels during this volatile tail of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand in Periods 12-14 (avg 386) is lower than the absolute peak in Period 11 (564) but remains ~15% higher than the early spring average of ~330.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which typically sees peak demand in late Spring/early Summer (May-June). After the volatile spike in Period 11 (demand 564) and following cooling (Period 13 demand 304), the last two periods (14 and 15) show demand stabilizing at higher levels (431 and 442). Period 16 is May 27, heading into June where demand for a lightweight 'Everyday Basic' is expected to remain consistent or slightly increase due to summer weather. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently very low (5 units on hand). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization profile (Periods 12-15), which averages ~400 units, significantly higher than the initial spring average. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the current high-utility summer regime while accounting for the recent increase in variability.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization detected (Periods 14-15): Demand has leveled out at ~436 units following the erratic peak/cooling cycle of Periods 11-13.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a stable summer regime. Demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) has been 431, 442, and 435, demonstrating remarkable consistency with an average of approximately 436 units. This follows the high volatility seen in May (P11-P13). The on-hand inventory is currently low (20 units), and actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while the demand is stable, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this localized summer stability. The service level target remains high (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) to capture these high-volume sales weeks in early June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) experienced a significant and unexpected demand spike in Period 17 (640 units), which is the highest demand observed to date (prev. high was 564 in Period 11). This occurred exactly one week after the start of June, suggesting a late-spring/early-summer acceleration in seasonal demand. The current inventory is 0 due to a stockout (640 demand vs 441 available). I am shifting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this new 'Summer High' regime by focusing on the most recent 4 periods (Periods 14-17), which includes the stabilization at ~440 and the newest jump to 640. This averages to approximately 487 units. While lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will increase sigma_hat using the same recent window to account for the heightened volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 95). This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts during this peak activity period.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak acceleration detected at Period 17: Demand jumped to 640 units, a 47% increase over the 3nd-quarter average (Periods 14-16: ~436).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1522.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight t-shirt, which is currently experiencing summer seasonal peaks. In Period 17 (June 3), demand spiked to 640 units before settling to 419 in Period 18. The current date (June 17) suggests we are in a high-demand summer regime. Historical patterns (Periods 11-13) showed high volatility with large spikes followed by temporary cooling. To capture the current summer demand level while accounting for the recent spike, I am using recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat, which averages the last two periods (~530 units). This ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal elevated state (average of 640 and 419) rather than the lower long-term mean. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the last few weeks (ranging from ~420 to 640). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern in the history.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed: Demand in the first two weeks of June (Periods 17-18) averaged 529.5 units, a 21% increase over the late May average of ~436.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24th, 2019. We are in a summer demand regime for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Reviewing the last three periods (P17-P19), demand was 640, 419, and 439 respectively. The high spike in P17 (640) was followed by two consistent weeks around 420-440, suggesting that while the absolute peak may have passed, demand remains strong and elevated compared to the spring average of ~330. In the last period (P19), demand was 439, and we ended with 170 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current summer demand level while accounting for the high volatility seen in P17, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent June behavior (average ~500) which balances the 640 spike with the more moderate 420-440 range.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Recent demand (Periods 17-20) has shown a summer peak followed by a cooling trend: 640 (P17), 419 (P18), 439 (P19), and 301 (P20). The average demand over these last 4 weeks is 449.75. The drop to 301 in Period 20 suggests the mid-June peak has passed, similar to the post-peak cooling observed in Period 13 (demands: 564, 424, 304). Actual lead time consistently remains 0 as confirmed by the continuous 'conclude' messages for every order placed. With 302 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to set parameters that maintain a service level for a stabilizing, though seasonally high, demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition from the June peak (640) to the current cooling trend (301), providing a balanced forecast that accounts for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Summer peak cooling detected at Period 20: Demand dropped to 301 after a high June average of ~500 (Periods 17-19). This mimics the mid-May cooling pattern previously observed.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is highly seasonal towards spring and summer. We are currently in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). Reviewing the history, demand followed a pattern of high peaks followed by cooling. Periods 17-19 saw a 'Summer peak' (avg. ~500), but demand has dropped significantly over the last two weeks: Period 20 (301) and Period 21 (232). This confirms a post-peak cooling regime. The 'Spring peak' in May also saw a similar drop (Period 13 saw demand drop to 304). Given the current on-hand inventory of 337 and the latest demand of 232, the current stock is likely sufficient if the downward trend continues into mid-July. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this cooling trend (average demand over P19-P21 is ~324), allowing the OR backend to adjust orders downward to prevent excess holding costs during this stabilization period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Summer peak stabilization confirmed at Period 21: Demand has dropped for two consecutive weeks (232 and 301) following the June peak (~500), mirroring the mid-May cooling pattern.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has exhibited significant seasonal demand fluctuations. Following a June peak where demand averaged ~500 units, a clear cooling phase has established over the last three periods (P20-P22), with demand dropping to an average of 257 units (301, 232, 238). This pattern strongly mirrors the post-spring peak cooling observed in mid-May. Given the current date of July 15th, demand is likely stabilizing into a mid-summer 'trough' before any potential late-summer or back-to-school transitions. Moving to a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat (N=3 reflects the current 'cooling' regime) yields a mean demand estimate of 257. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on hand (175) is currently covering a significant portion of the expected demand, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to return to the base stock level suitable for this lower-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand cooling confirmed (P20-P22): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~257 units, down from the June average of ~500.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is currently in a mid-summer cooling phase following a sharp peak in June. Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) has stabilized significantly, averaging 245.75 units (301, 232, 238, 212), which is consistent with the 'Mid-summer demand cooling' insight recorded in Period 23. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To align inventory with this lower, stabilized demand regime and avoid overstocking (holding cost is $1.0 vs profit $4.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P20-P23) to capture this specific regime. This recent sample size (N=4) is sufficient given the clear shift from the previous June average of ~500.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which has exhibited two major seasonal peaks (May and June) followed by significant cooling. Since Period 20, demand has stabilized into a lower mid-summer regime. The last five weeks of demand are [301, 232, 238, 212, 207], showing a clear downward trend that has now plateaued around an average of 219 units. Given the date (July 29), we are deep in the summer season where 'Womens Everyday Basics' typically maintain a steady but non-peak volume before potential back-to-school or transitional shifts. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized demand of ~218 units, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this period compared to the high-variance peaks seen earlier in the year.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer stabilization confirmed at Period 24: Demand has settled into a consistent regime averaging ~218 units over the last 4 weeks (Periods 21-24), with significantly lower volatility than the spring/early-summer peaks.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Current data from August 5th confirms a sustained mid-to-late summer cooling period. Demand has consistently dropped over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), moving from May/June peaks of ~500 down to a recent 5-week average of 208.6 units (P21-P25). The most recent demand (P25) was 154, the lowest since the game began. This suggests we are entering a late-summer/pre-autumn lull for this basic t-shirt. Lead time is stable at 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (mean ~209, std ~35) while ignoring the high-volatility peaks of June.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling confirmed at Period 25: Demand has reached a new seasonal low (154 units) following a 5-week cooling trend starting at Period 21. The new stable regime average is ~209 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is continuing its late-summer cooling trend. Period 26 demand dropped to 102 units, followng 154 in Period 25. The current average over the last 6 periods (since the end of the June peak) is approximately 191 units, but the most recent two weeks average only 128 units. We are seeing a clear seasonal wind-down as we enter mid-August. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs during this decline, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the accelerating downward trend. This will set a lower base stock level appropriate for the current low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand floor exploration: Demand has dropped significantly in August (Periods 25-26), averaging 128 units, compared to the July average of ~218. This suggests a seasonal transition to autumn low-volume baseline for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (lightweight jersey t-shirt) is exiting its peak summer season and moving into a late-August low-volume regime. Demand over the last 3 periods (P25-P27) has averaged 125 units (154, 102, 120), significantly lower than the July average of ~218 and the June peak of ~500. This confirms a seasonal floor exploration. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new stabilized low-demand floor while maintaining a standard sigma calculation to protect against the residual volatility seen in Period 27 (demand slightly increased from 102 to 120). This approach balances the need to minimize holding costs on a declining seasonal item while maintaining service levels for the remaining baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand floor confirmed: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~125 units over the last 3 weeks (Periods 25-27), marking a clear end to the summer peak and a transition to an autumn baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight women's jersey t-shirt. Current data from August (Periods 25-28) confirms a transition to a late-summer/early-autumn low-volume baseline. Demand in the most recent periods was 154, 102, 120, and 158, resulting in a 4-period average of 133.5. This follows the significant cooling trend from the June peak (~500). Given the stable 0-period lead time and the cooling pattern, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower-demand regime while maintaining enough inventory to cover slight weekly fluctuations. This prevents overstocking as the season ends while maintaining a high service level for the remaining baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline confirmed: Demand for lightweight jersey basics has stabilized at a lower average of ~134 units over the last 4 weeks (Periods 25-28), down from the late-summer average of ~218.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in an autumn baseline period. Historical demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend starting around Period 20, with stabilizing demand over the last 5 weeks (Periods 25-29). Specifically, demand has averaged 134.8 units during this stabilization phase (154, 102, 120, 158, 140). The most recent period (P29) demand was 140, which is consistent with this new regime. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages in history. Since we are in a relatively stable low-volume period compared to the summer and spring peaks, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this autumn baseline accurately while ignoring the high-volatility peaks from earlier in the year. This ensures we don't over-order based on outdated seasonal demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which has transitioned from a summer peak into an autumn baseline. The demand has stabilized significantly over the last 6 weeks (Periods 25-30), averaging 136.5 units per week (demands: 154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145). Current demand behavior is consistent with an 'autumn floor' regime. On-hand inventory is 10 units, and the lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain the 80% service level targeted by the OR backend (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods of stabilized demand (N=6) to avoid overweighting the previous high-volume summer data. This ensures we carry enough for the current baseline without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline stability confirmed (Periods 25-30): Demand for lightweight jersey basics has leveled at an average of ~137 units per week with moderate volatility (StdDev ~20).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable autumn baseline regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) has averaged 131 units with a low standard deviation (~20). The most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show even higher stability with demand values of 140, 145, and 141 respectively (mean ~142). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given this stability, I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 to capture the full period since the late-summer cooling stabilized, which provides a reliable estimate for the current baseline while mitigating the impact of previous high-demand summer peaks. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that satisfies the 80% service level required by the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1) without over-ordering during this lower-volume season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has moved into a stable autumn baseline following various spring and summer peaks. Demand over the last 8 periods (since Period 25) has stabilized remarkably well around a mean of ~137 units (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135), with significantly lower volatility than earlier in the year. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given this stability, I will use a recent window of N=8 to capture the current autumn baseline. This approach provides enough data to accurately estimate the current mean (~137) and standard deviation (~18) while filtering out the irrelevant high-volume summer peaks. This will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level for this lower-demand period while minimizing holding costs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which has moved into an autumn baseline stability phase after significant spring/summer peaks. For the last 9 periods (P25-P33), demand has been extremely stable, averaging 137.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.0. The most recent three weeks (P31-P33) show demand of 141, 135, and 147, further confirming this stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) relative to the expected demand (~140), and there is no pipeline inventory, the goal is to maintain this baseline volume. I will use a recent_N of 9 periods to capture this entire autumn stabilization window while excluding the high-volume summer data, ensuring the OR backend accurately sets the base stock for the current regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (610776002) has reached a stable autumn baseline. Since Period 25, demand has consistently fluctuated around a mean of ~135 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P31-P34) show demands of 141, 135, 147, and 106, resulting in a recent mean of 132.25. The current on-hand inventory is 47 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every historical conclude message. Given the low volatility in this autumn regime (StdDev ~17.5 over P25-P34), I will use the recent N=10 periods (covering P25 to P34) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire stable autumn baseline while ignoring the higher summer volumes. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected stable demand while maintaining low holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-October. Demand for the product 'Tilly (1)', a lightweight jersey t-shirt, is exhibiting a secondary cooling phase following the established Autumn baseline. Specifically, demand in the last two weeks (Periods 34-35) has dropped to 106 and 85, significantly lower than the previous Autumn stabilized average of ~140. This aligns with seasonal expectations for a summer-weight garment as temperatures drop in October. I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to a more sensitive window (recent_N where N=5) to capture this downward trend (averaging ~122.8 over the last 5 weeks) and avoid overstocking into a potentially lower winter floor. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second Autumn cooling detected at Period 35: Demand dropped to 85 (Period 35) and 106 (Period 34), reflecting a shift away from the previous stable baseline of ~140 observed during September. This represents a -32% shift in the last two weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal cooling phase as of October 21st. Demand has dropped from a September baseline of ~140 units to a three-week average of ~91.6 units (Periods 34-36: 106, 85, 84). History shows lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs for this basic jersey item as we move further into autumn, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new, lower demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to lower the base stock level accordingly while maintaining the required service level for its $4.0 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Second Autumn cooling regime confirmed (P34-P36): Demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~92 units, a 34% decrease from the September baseline of ~140.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (Period 38, Oct 28), a period characterized by a sustained downshift in demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime over the last four weeks (Period 34-37), averaging approximately 96 units, compared to the September average of ~140. The current date is Period 38, with lead time consistently at 0 periods. Inventory starting this period is 0. Recent demand data since the shift (Period 34: 106, P35: 85, P36: 84, P37: 109) suggests using a recent window (N=4) to capture this new cooling regime and prevent over-ordering.mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N (N=4) to align with this current demand level of ~96 while accounting for the moderate variance seen recently.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the 'Everyday Basics' lightweight T-shirt continues to settle into its secondary autumn cooling regime. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 92.4 units ([106, 85, 84, 109, 78]), confirming the previous insight of a ~34% drop from the September baseline of ~140. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders placed in P34-P38 all arrived within the same period). Given the stable but lower demand as we head into winter (which is usually a low season for lightweight jersey basics), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this current regime. The service level provided by the OR backend (approx 80% based on $4 profit / $1 holding cost) remains appropriate for this low-cost basic item.

Carry-over insight: Second autumn cooling regime confirmed (P34-P38): Demand has stabilized at an average of ~92 units, reflecting a permanent seasonal shift from the September baseline of ~140.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the 'Autumn cooling' regime for this lightweight t-shirt. Period 39 demand was 61, continuing the downward trend from the late October average of ~92. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 83.8 units (85, 84, 109, 78, 61, 106). The most recent three weeks show a further decline (avg ~82). Given the seasonal context of a lightweight t-shirt in mid-November, I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture the current lower-volume regime while acknowledging the downward momentum. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history, so I am using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn cooling confirmed: Demand for lightweight jersey basics has dropped to a new average of ~84 units over the last 6 weeks (Periods 34-39), a significant decrease from the previous September baseline of ~140.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a stable late-autumn/early-winter regime for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey t-shirt. Demand has consistently stayed low as temperatures drop, reflecting a transition away from the primary spring/summer peaks. Over the last seven periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged approximately 84.5 units (106, 85, 84, 109, 78, 61, 69). The most recent three weeks (P38-P40) show an even lower average of ~69 units, indicating that the cooling trend is fully realized. Given the promised lead time remains 0 and observations confirm actual lead time is 0, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to capture this established lower-volume regime (approx. 85 units per period). Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect the current reduced volatility (StdDev ~17) compared to previous months. This approach ensures we maintain enough inventory to meet demand without overstocking during the year-end low-volume period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019 (Period 43). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt. Reviewing the last 9 weeks (since Period 34), we've seen a stable 'Late-Autumn cooling' regime. Average demand from P34-P42 is approximately 87 units. However, we've just seen a slight uptick in demand at Period 42 (109 units), possibly due to the start of the holiday shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week). Despite this slight rise, the product's seasonal profile (lightweight t-shirt) is counter-seasonal for December, so I expect demand to remain relatively low compared to the spring/summer peaks but potentially higher than the Oct/Nov floor. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent stabilization at this lower level while allowing for minor holiday volatility, I will use a restricted window (N=9) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, heading into the final periods of the year. Demand for this lightweight jersey t-shirt has been in a sustained 'Late-Autumn/Winter' cooling regime. Over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), demand has averaged approximately 83 units. The most recent demand (P43) was 61 units, following a volatile P42 (109 units, likely a minor Black Friday/Cyber Monday ripple). Given the product description (lightweight jersey), demand is expected to remain at this lower winter baseline. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use recent_N=10 to capture this low-volume regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default (0) for lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while accounting for recent volatility (StdDev ~17).

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline confirmed (P34-P43): Average demand for lightweight jersey basics has stabilized at ~83 units per week, representing the seasonal low for the year.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for the 'Everyday Basics' t-shirt is in its seasonal winter low (Winter baseline), with an average demand of approximately 83 units since Period 34. Period 44 saw a demand of 55, continuing this low-volume trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'Period 44 conclude'. Given the stability of this winter regime over the last 11 weeks, I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the mean and standard deviation for this specific seasonal period. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level appropriate for the current low-demand environment, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level consistent with a 0-lead time environment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is currently in its off-peak winter season. Demand has been stable at a low winter baseline. Over the last 12 periods (P34-P45), demand has averaged 80.6 units. The most recent 5 periods (P41-P45) show a slightly lower average of 71.2 units (67, 109, 61, 55, 64), though Period 42 saw a minor spike to 109. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in history. We are approaching the final week (Period 47). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader winter baseline (avg ~80) while acknowledging the slight downward trend in the last few weeks to avoid over-ordering as we reach the game end.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). This is the final period. The demand context for 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey' has remained in a stable winter baseline since Period 34. Average demand over the last 13 periods (P34-P46) is approximately 81.5 units. The most recent demand was 92 (Period 46), likely a small holiday-related uptick, but still within the established low-season regime. Since actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period), I will maintain L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture the entire winter regime stats, which ensures the backend has enough data to set a base stock that covers the end-of-year baseline demand while minimizing holding cost for this last observation.
