Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt). The current date is 2019/2/11. Historical demand for the last five periods shows a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308. The average demand is 204.8, but the most recent figure (308) suggests a significant positive momentum, possibly due to seasonal transition into spring. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the order arrives within the same period. We must cover the current period's demand (Review Period + Lead Time = 1). I will use a recent N of 3 to capture the recent growth (averaging ~233) while allowing the OR engine to calculate variance based on that same window. No shipments are in transit or lost as this is the first period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's basic jersey t-shirt. Period 1 observed a lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand in Period 1 was 266, which is higher than the provided historical samples (148, 175, 160, 233, 308). The average of the 5 historical samples is 204.8, while the average including Period 1 is 215. The recent trend (last 3 samples: 233, 308, 266) suggests a higher demand level compared to the earlier periods. Given it is mid-February, we might be seeing the start of spring season demand for basics. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this elevated demand mean and variance while maintaining stability. The 'explicit' method is not yet necessary as the 'recent_N' will automatically scale by (1+L) = 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current data shows high demand relative to the provided historical samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. In the last two periods (observed after decisions), demand was 266 and 316. In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 301, demand 316), meaning we lost/missed 15 units of demand. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1 and 2 arrivals. Demand is trending upwards. I will use recent history (N=5, which includes the last 2 actual periods and 3 most recent historical samples) to capture the current higher demand level while ignoring the very early lower samples. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using recent_N to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this step-up in demand and to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: Current demand (avg ~291) is significantly higher than pre-game history (avg ~204), representing a ~42% increase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear pivot: the pre-simulation average was ~204.8, while the last three periods (Period 1-3) have averaged 296 units (266, 316, 306). This represents a sustained ~44% increase in demand. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) and there is no pipeline. With L=0, the system needs to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy the current trend around 300 units/period, while maintaining the L=0 parameter.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-3 average 296 units, 44% higher than pre-game history. Lead time L=0 is consistently realized in history.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's jersey t-shirt. Current demand remains consistently higher than pre-game history. Specifically, the game history demands are [266, 316, 306, 283], which averages ~293 units per period. This confirms the previously identified regime shift of ~44% growth compared to the pre-game mean of ~204. The actual lead time L=0 is consistently realized in all 4 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. We are currently in early March (2019/3/11), entering the spring season, which typically supports sustained demand for basic t-shirts. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the recent demand mean (~293) and standard deviation based on the last 4 periods to maintain high service levels while managing our $1.0 holding cost versus $4.0 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime confirmed: Periods 1-4 average demand is 292.75, representing a persistent 43.5% increase over pre-game baseline. Lead time L=0 remains stable.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (266, 316, 306, 283, 252) averages 284.6 units, confirming the higher demand regime established in previous periods (~40% higher than pre-game history). The date is mid-March, entering the spring season, which typically supports demand for basic jersey T-shirts. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by the conclude messages for P1 through P5. With on-hand inventory at 60 units and L=0, the OR backend needs to cover current period demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's mean (284.6) and volatility (approx 26.5), while keeping L at the promised 0 since observations align with the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Periods 1-5 average 284.6 units (+40% vs pre-game).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is exhibiting a stable demand regime significantly higher than pre-game history. The average demand over the first 6 periods is 282.17 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270), compared to the pre-game average of 204.8. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, as confirmed by 'Period X conclude' messages. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units. Since L=0 and seasonality (late March) for everyday basics is generally stable, I will use recent history (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the ~38% higher demand level compared to the long-term history while maintaining responsiveness to the observed volatility (std dev ~23).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown a significant regime shift compared to pre-game data, with the last 7 periods averaging ~293 units. Period 7 recorded a sharp spike to 364 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike likely reflects early spring seasonality for lightweight jersey tops. The actual lead time L=0 is highly reliable (confirmed in all 7 preceding periods). To prevent further stockouts during this potential seasonal upward trend, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current higher-demand regime while including the recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer for the recent variance, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 7 (364 units) suggests a seasonal shift for spring (April 1st); current 7-period average is 293.8 (+44% vs pre-game).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1308.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (Periods 7 and 8) shows a significant spike (364 and 372 units), correlating with the product being a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' and the onset of April/spring. The pre-game average was ~204, the Periods 1-6 average was ~282, and the last two periods averaged 368 units. This indicates a clear seasonal regime shift. Period 8 resulted in a stockout (327 available vs 372 demand), meaning true demand is likely even higher than recorded sales. Lead time L=0 is definitively confirmed through consistent same-period arrivals in all 8 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this spring peak, and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to provide a buffer for the increased volatility seen in the last two weeks while still considering recent history.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal peak confirmed: Demand increased to ~370+ units starting late March (Period 7), significantly exceeding the early-year average of ~282. Stockouts in P7 and P8 indicate supply is currently lagging behind this seasonal acceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $940.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a spring seasonal period (April 15th). Previous periods (P7-P8) showed a significant demand surge (~368 avg), followed by a drop in Period 9 (271). However, Period 9's drop may be a standard variation within a higher-demand regime rather than a return to the early-year baseline, as spring weather typically drives T-shirt sales. The current on-hand inventory is 144 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent N approach (N=3) to capture the seasonal shift starting at Period 7 (demands: 364, 372, 271). This results in a mean demand of 335.6. Given the stockouts in P7 and P8, targeting a slightly higher volume is safer to capture potential sales as we deeper into spring, while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand volatility confirmed: Periods 7-9 show a high-demand regime (avg 335.6) compared to Periods 1-6 (avg 282), though P9 showed a temporary dip from the P7-P8 peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its spring seasonal peak (late April). Historically, lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Demand analysis shows two regimes: early periods (P1-P6) averaged 284.6 units, while the spring season (P7-P10) has seen a shift to a higher, more volatile mean of approximately 329 units (364, 372, 271, 310). The dip in Period 9 and recovery in Period 10 suggests a stabilization around this higher level. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher spring demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal average (~329) and the increased volatility observed in the spring weeks, helping to recover service levels after the stockouts in P7 and P8.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April), a peak season for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts'. Period 11 saw a massive demand spike to 564 units, far exceeding the recent high-demand regime average of ~335. This resulted in a total stockout. The product has a consistent lead time of 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this seasonal acceleration, I am shifting to an explicit forecast. The demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 376.2 units, but the most recent 3 periods averaged 381 with a huge upward jump. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (376.2 units per period) adjusted for the recent spike, targeting a base stock that covers approximately 450-500 units to buffer against the volatility seen in Period 11. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this increased volatility without over-penalizing for the single P11 outlier too aggressively, while L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed in late April (Period 11: 564 units), indicating a potential transition from a standard spring regime (~335) to a high-summer/peak-spring peak. 5-period avg (P7-P11) is now 376.2.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, making it highly sensitive to the spring-to-summer transition. We are currently in early May (Period 13), following a significant demand surge in late April (Period 11: 564 units, Period 12: 424 units). This indicates a transition from the earlier spring average of ~335 to a higher seasonal plateau. The last 3 periods (P10-P12) average 432 units, while the last 6 periods (P7-P12) average 384 units. Given the seasonality of basic jersey T-shirts in May, the 3-period average is the most responsive indicator of the current regime. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0, confirmed by the 'Period 12 conclude' message showing the P12 order arrived within the same period. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand and volatility of this new seasonal phase, ensuring the base-stock level is high enough to prevent further stockouts seen in P11.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late spring/early summer transition: Periods 10-12 average demand is 432 units, a 52% increase over the early spring average of ~284. Volatility has also increased significantly following the P11 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $980.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak summer demand season (Current Date: May 13). We are observing high volatility and a general upward trend in demand. Recent demand (P11-P13) has averaged 430.7 units, despite a dip to 304 in P13. Given the products' seasonal nature and the significant stockouts in P11 and P7-P8, the system must remain aggressive. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift towards higher summer demand (averaging ~400 units), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the high variance observed during this transition phase (demand range 304-564). Lead time L is consistently 0, so I will continue to use the default promised lead time. This strategy ensures we have enough stock to meet potential spikes like that seen in Period 11 (564 units) while acknowledging the high service level required (Profit $4 / Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand acceleration confirmed: Period 11 peak (564) and Period 10-13 average (400.5) indicate a sustained higher demand regime compared to the early spring average of ~284 (a ~41% increase).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. As a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, we are entering the peak summer season where demand is historically stronger and more volatile. The recent history (Periods 11-14) shows a high-demand regime with an average of 430.75 units, significantly higher than the early spring average of ~284. Although there was a dip to 304 in Period 13, Period 14 bounced back to 431, confirming the sustained summer demand. A stockout in Period 11 (demand 564) highlights the risk of under-ordering during these seasonal transitions. Given the promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P11-P14) to capture this summer level (avg 430.75), and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen since the late April surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime solidified: Periods 11-14 average 430.8 units, confirming a ~50% increase over the early spring baseline (avg ~284). Demand peaks are exceeding 550 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are in a confirmed summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (Periods 11-15) has averaged 433 units, with a notable peak of 564 in Period 11. Although Period 13 saw a dip (304), Period 14 (431) and Period 15 (442) show a stabilization around the 430-450 range. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met, meaning orders placed now arrive in time to satisfy this period's demand. To avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 7, 8, and 11 during demand surges, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current high-demand mean (~433) and its associated volatility. This period (late May) is typically the start of the peak summer season for lightweight jersey basics, so maintaining a base stock levels aligned with the recent ~430 average is prudent.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak summer season (June 3rd). A clear demand regime shift was observed starting around Period 11 (late April), with demand consistently averaging over 400 units. The last 6 periods (P11-P16) have seen demands of 564, 424, 304, 431, 442, and 435, resulting in a mean of 433.3. This represents a sustained ~50% increase over the early spring average (~284). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high demand and the approach of peak summer temperatures, I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this current high-demand summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that accounts for the higher mean and recent volatility (sigma), ensuring high service levels while minimizing lost sales during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime sustained: Periods 11-16 average demand is 433.3 units, representing a stable transition to a high-volume summer phase compared to the P1-P6 average of 284 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer peak regime. Period 17 observed a significant spike to 640 units, the highest in history, leading to a stockout. The date is June 10th, mid-summer, which aligns with seasonal demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand is 462.8 units with high volatility (Standard Deviation ~105), compared to the earlier summer average of ~430. To prevent recurring stockouts at this seasonal peak, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) by focusing on this most recent high-demand regime (N=7). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment, so I will maintain L=0.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand accelerated starting Period 17: Single-period demand reached 640 units. The average for the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is 462.8, a significant increase from the early spring average of ~284.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt. The demand pattern has shown significant volatility with peaks exceeding 600 units (P17: 640). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is approximately 457 units. Although the previous period (P18) saw a dip to 419, the context of late June suggests demand will remain high and potentially increase as we move deeper into summer. Lead time is stable at L=0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current high-summer regime (P11-P18) which better reflects the current appetite than the full history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the increased volatility (SD ~100) observed during this summer peak, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P11 and P17.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P11-P18) average is 457.4 units, with high volatility (SD ~100) and peaks >600 units. Early spring base (P1-P6) was 284.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, and we are currently in late June (6/24), the height of the summer demand season. Since the regime shift in Period 11, the average demand has stabilized at 457.4 units (P11-P19), with significant volatility (SD ~100) and peaks exceeding 600 units (e.g., P11: 564, P17: 640). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts during these peaks while balancing a high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), I will use the last 9 periods (P11-P19) as the active regime (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This captures the summer peak levels and the increased volatility observed since late April.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The SKU (Women's T-shirt) is in its peak summer season. Historically, demand has been heightened since Period 11 (late April), with an average demand of approximately 445 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20). Although Period 20 saw a dip to 301, this follows the pattern seen in Period 13 and Period 19, where high-demand weeks are interspersed with lower ones. Given the product type and date, demand is expected to remain high throughout July. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-summer regime (average ~445, SD ~95) while remaining responsive to the high volatility observed in this period (peaks >600).

The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which reached peak demand during the summer months (June/July). Period 22 (July 8) is typically the start of the late-summer phase where demand often stabilizes or begins to taper relative to the early summer peak (>600 units). Recent demand in Period 20 (301) and Period 21 (232) suggests a significant cooling off from the high-summer regime (P11-P19 average was ~450). The average demand of the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 347.75. Given the high profitability ($4.0) vs holding cost ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a high service level (80% quantile). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this recent downward trajectory better than a long-term average, while recent_N=11 for sigma_hat maintains a larger historical buffer to guard against the high volatility observed during June. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in July: Demand averaged 266.5 over P20-P21, a significant decrease from the P11-P19 summer peak average of ~450.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has entered a cooling phase following the summer peak (P11-P19 avg ~457). Over the last three periods (P20-P22), demand has significantly dropped to an average of 257.0 units (301, 232, 238). This aligns with a mid-July seasonal transition in retail where early summer peaks subside. The lead time remains consistent at L=0. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this new lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this local cooling trend. The current on-hand inventory (207) is nearly sufficient to cover the recent average demand, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the service-level target.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Periods 20-22 average demand is 257.0 units, a ~44% decrease from the summer peak average of ~457 (P11-P19).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has entered a clear cooling phase as we move further into July (mid-summer). The high-demand summer peak observed from Periods 11-19 (average ~457) has subsided. The last four periods (P20-P23) have shown a consistent decline with demands of 301, 232, 238, and 212 respectively, resulting in a new regime average of approximately 246 units. This shift aligns with typical retail patterns where summer basics demand tapers off after the initial peak. Lead time remains stable at L=0. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime and adjust inventory levels downward to avoid excessive holding costs, while maintaining sufficient stock for the current lower but stable demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime solidified: Periods 20-23 average demand is 245.8 units, a ~46% decrease from the summer peak average of 457 (P11-P19).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has clearly entered a cooling regime following the summer peak. The cooling began around Period 20 (late June/early July). Demands for the last five periods (P20-P24) are 301, 232, 238, 212, and 207. This establishes a stable post-peak average of approximately 238 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak average of 457 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this downward shift immediately. Volatility has also stabilized alongside the lower volume, so I will use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat as well. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by the most recent arrival (P24 order arrived in P24). No shipments are missing or deferred.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime solidified: Periods 20-24 average demand is 238.0 units (down ~48% from summer peak avg 457).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt has entered a significant post-summer cooling phase. The most recent demand (Period 25) was 154 units, marking the lowest point in the current regime. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has averaged 223.8 units, down from the summer peak (P11-P19) average of ~457 units. This trend is consistent with seasonal cooling in August. I will use recent_N=6 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and stabilize inventory levels against the current lower demand base. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified in August: Period 25 demand dropped to 154 units; the 6-period average (P20-P25) is 223.8, a ~51% reduction from the summer peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly seasonal. We are now in mid-August (Period 27), and the demand has shown a clear and sustained cooling trend since the summer peak (P11-P19 avg ~457). The last 7 periods (P20-P26) show a demand sequence of [301, 232, 238, 212, 207, 154, 102], demonstrating a consistent downward trajectory as the summer season ends. The most recent three periods average 154.3, significantly lower than the July average. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs during this decline, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this intensifying cooling phase. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified in August: Demand has dropped for three consecutive periods reaching a low of 102 in P26; the 3-period average (P24-P26) is 154.3, suggesting a faster decline than the initial July cooldown.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a sustained cooling phase following the summer peak. The most recent demand (P26: 102, P27: 120) indicates that the rapid decline observed in early August is stabilizing into a lower-volume late-summer/early-autumn regime. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is 125.3 units, significantly lower than the July average (approx. 240). Current on-hand inventory is 93. Given a lead time of 0 periods, we need to order enough to meet this week's demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current lower demand trend (avg ~145) while acknowledging the stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the decreased volatility at these lower volume levels. Lead time L is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling regime stabilized in August: Periods 25-27 average 125.3 units, down from the July average of ~240 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which exhibited a significant summer peak (P11-P19) and has been in a clear cooling phase since July. Current date is August 26 (P29). The cooling regime has stabilized recently; demand for the last four periods (P25-P28) was 154, 102, 120, and 158. The average demand across this stable post-summer low is 133.5. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand (27) is low relative to recent demand (avg ~134), while holding costs ($1) are 25% of unit profit ($4), necessitating lean but sufficient stock. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current stable low-demand window, ensuring the inventory level covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). This prevents both excessive holding costs during a seasonal trough and stockouts if demand fluctuates slightly upwards as seen in P28.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand has transitioned from a sharp decline in early August to a stable low-volume regime, averaging 133.5 units over P25-P28.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized in a post-summer cooling regime. After a sharp decline from the summer peak (avg ~457), demand has leveled off over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), averaging 134.8 units ([154, 102, 120, 158, 140]). This suggests the rapid descent observed in early August has found a new floor for the approach into Autumn. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set the demand parameters based on this recent 5-period window to capture the current stable low-volume regime while preparing for any potential minor fluctuations in early September.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand has stabilized: Periods 25-29 average 134.8 units, marking the end of the August decline and the establishment of a stable late-season baseline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight T-shirt, which has moved from its summer peak into a stable post-summer demand regime. As of September 9th (Period 31), the extreme demand volatility and high volumes seen in late spring and summer (avg ~450) have subsided. The demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) with an average of 136.5 units (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the stability of this new baseline, I am using a recent_N approach with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand profile while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the moderate variation (102 to 158) observed in this regime. This ensures we avoid excessive holding costs as we head further into the autumn season while maintaining a high service level for the current consumption rate.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized after the post-summer decline. Current demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) has averaged 137.1 units with relatively low volatility. The most recent demand (P31) was 141, and the 3-period average (P29-P31) is 142.0. This indicates that the cooling phase identified in August has transitioned into a stable autumn baseline. Lead time L=0 has been consistently maintained throughout the game history. To optimize for the current stable regime, I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the post-decline behavior (P25-P31) while ignoring the high-volume summer peaks. This will ensure we have enough stock to meet the ~140 unit weekly demand without accumulating excess inventory as we move further into September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stable regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized from Period 25 through Period 31, averaging 137.1 units per period, following the sharp August cooling phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Jersey T-shirt) has entered a very stable autumn regime. Since Period 25 (late August), demand has moved from a sharp summer decline into a steady state. The last 8 periods (P25-P32) show a very tight range with demand values of [154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135]. Excluding the outlier low in Period 26, the mean is approximately 140 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P29-P32) display extremely low variance (140, 145, 141, 135). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as confirmed by history. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer level while smoothing out the minor oscillation seen in August.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Jersey T-shirt) has entered a stable autumn regime. Since Period 25 (post-summer cooling), demand has equilibrated around 130-140 units. Specifically, from Period 29 through Period 33, demand values were 140, 145, 141, 135, and 147. This yields a 5-period average of 141.6 units with very low volatility compared to the summer peak. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (L=0) have been consistently realized. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the service level remains prioritized. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the entirety of this stable autumn phase (starting P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend stays responsive to this lower-volume but consistent demand pattern without over-ordering based on older summer data.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has entered a stable autumn regime. Since Period 25, demand has consistently hovered around a mean of ~135 units. The most recent demand (P34) was 106, which is a slight dip but still within the expected variance for this low-volume season. History shows lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods. To maintain optimal service levels while minimizing holding costs in this stable regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation, focusing on the last 10 periods (P25-P34). This window covers the entire post-decline stability phase, capturing the current mean (~135) and standard deviation accurately. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 0-period lead time and the current period's demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has transitioned from a stable autumn regime (avg ~137 units, P25-P31) into a late-autumn decline. The last two periods (P34-P35) have shown a noticeable drop to 106 and 85 units respectively, aligning with the end of the season for a jersey basic T-shirt. Given the clear downward trend in October, I am shifting from the long-term autumn average to a more responsive window (recent_N=5) to capture this cooling. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) maintains a safe but reduced inventory level to avoid overstocking at the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped below the stable autumn average of 137 units starting Period 34 (106 units) and intensified in Period 35 (85 units), indicating a seasonal wind-down.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is showing a clear seasonal wind-down as we enter late October. A significant demand regime shift was confirmed starting Period 34 (106 units) and Period 35 (85 units), moving away from the stable autumn average of ~137. Period 36 demand (84 units) further confirms this lower regime. Given the cooling temperatures in late October, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand environment (averaging ~91.7 units). Lead time (L) has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history, so I am using the 'calculate' method to utilize that stability. The service level (q) remains high since profit ($4) is 4x the holding cost ($1), but the capped policy will help prevent overstocking as the season ends.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is in a late-autumn cooling phase as of October 28th. Demand has shifted from a stable autumn baseline (avg ~137) to a significantly lower regime starting Period 34. The demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) has been 106, 85, 84, and 109, respectively (avg 96.0). Period 37 saw a slight uptick but resulted in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0), suggesting demand is currently floor-stabilized around 100 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this lower late-season demand while providing enough stock to recover from the current stockout. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime stabilized: Periods 34-37 average demand is 96.0 units, a ~30% decrease from the earlier autumn baseline of 137 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is in a late-autumn demand cooling phase as of early November. The recent demand regime (Periods 34-38) has stabilized around an average of 92.4 units ([106, 85, 84, 109, 78]), which is significantly lower than the early-autumn average of 137 units. Currently, lead time L=0 is consistently observed. At Period 39, we have 30 units on hand. To prevent stockouts while minimizing holding costs (which are significant at $1/unit compared to $4 profit), I will use the recent 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current stabilized late-season baseline and accounts for recent volatility (SD ~15) to maintain an appropriate base-stock level for the current week's demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime solidified (P34-P38): Average demand is 92.4 units, representing a stable wind-down baseline for November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is in a late-autumn demand cooling phase. History shows a stable autumn baseline of ~137 units (P25-P33) followed by a definitive shift starting P34. The demand has averaged 84.6 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39: 85, 84, 109, 78, 61), confirming the 'late-autumn' regime identified in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 (ordered units arrive in the same period). To optimize for this declining phase, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent trend from P34-P39 (avg 87.1), which allows the OR backend to set a base stock reflective of current low-volume reality while providing enough safety stock for the lingering volatility (e.g., the 109 demand in P37).

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P34-P39) confirmed: Average demand is 87.1 units, reflecting a ~36% decrease from the early autumn baseline. Demand volatility remains moderate as the season winds down.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is seasonally reaching its lowest demand point in late November (Period 41). Demand has stabilized into a late-autumn wind-down regime. Over the most recent 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 84.6 units, significantly down from the early autumn average of ~137. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) show even lower stability at 69.3 units. Since lead time L=0 is consistently realized, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-season baseline while providing enough buffer for minor fluctuations. This ensures we don't overstock as the game nears its final periods in December.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/early-winter demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 34-40 average 84.6 units (a ~38% reduction from the early autumn 137-unit baseline).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a late-autumn/early-winter wind-down phase. Demand has stabilized significantly over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), averaging 82.38 units per period compared to the early autumn average of ~137. The last three periods (P39-P41) show consistent demand between 61 and 69 units (avg 65.6). To capture this persistent but slight downward trend and minimize holding costs during the end-of-season period, I will use a recent_N window of 8 for mu_hat (N=8) and sigma_hat (N=8), covering the entire wind-down regime that began in P34. Lead time L=0 is consistently confirmed by historical data, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand history indicates a late-autumn/early-winter stabilization phase. However, Period 42 showed a jump to 109 units, ending the period with 0 on-hand inventory. This spike likely reflects early December shopping or a minor volatility shift, as the previous 7-period average (P34-P40) was approximately 84.6 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the recent demand increase and ensure adequate stock for the start of December while balancing the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5. This N captures the shift in Period 42 while maintaining the context of the late-season baseline (P38-P42 avg: 76.8, including the spike). This choice helps the OR backend adjust to the stockout in P42 without overreacting to a single high data point.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/early-winter demand stabilized around 85 units (P34-P41), but Period 42 showed a localized spike to 109 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44). The seasonal context is early winter, where demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized at a lower baseline (averaging 74.2 units over the last 5 periods: P39-P43). While Period 42 showed a brief spike to 109, Period 43 returned to the low level (61 units), which is consistent with the established late-autumn/early-winter regime of ~85 units noted in the Carry-over Insights. The lead time L remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent stabilization at this lower level while allowing for minor winter volatility, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 (covering the period since the start of November) and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the specific variance of this wind-down phase. This ensures we carry enough stock for the base demand without incurring excessive holding costs on a declining seasonal item.

Carry-over insight: Early winter demand regime stabilization: Periods 34-43 average 84.5 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P39-P43) averaging 73.4 units, confirming a consistent low-volume baseline for the end-of-year period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th (Period 45), approaching the end of the game (Period 47). The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt is in a stable low-volume winter regime. Over the last 11 periods (P34-P44), demand has averaged 80.4 units. Specifically, the last 6 periods (P39-P44) have averaged 70.3 units, with the most recent demand being 55. We are seeing a steady wind-down consistent with late Q4 seasonality. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the close proximity to the end of the simulation and the declining trend, I will use recent_N (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering and minimize holding costs for the final periods, while still capturing the current low-volume demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand decline intensified in December: Periods 43-44 average 58.0 units, indicating a further softening from the P34-P42 average of 87.1.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), peak winter season for a jersey T-shirt. Demand has significantly cooled from the autumn baseline (avg ~137) to a low-volume winter regime. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), demand has averaged 87.8 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P43-P45) show a further decline to 60.0 units (61, 55, 64). Given the 'Everyday Basics' nature, a complete drop to zero is unlikely, but a conservative approach is needed as we reach the end of the year. Lead time L is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the late November and December stabilization around ~70-80 units, while accounting for the recent sub-70 periods. This N=7 window (P39-P45) averages 69.4 units, which appropriately reflects the current winter trough.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Periods 43-45 average 60.0 units, marking the lowest sustained demand regime of the year, down from the early Nov average of ~85.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on December 30th. Historically, the end-of-year period has seen a cooling trend, with the winter trough confirmed (averaging 60.0 units over P43-P45). However, Period 46 showed a localized spike to 92 units (outstripping on-hand inventory), similar to the spike observed in Period 42. While demand is generally lower in winter, these late-month spikes suggest some residual activity. I will set mu_hat based on the recent winter regime (last 4 periods, P43-P46) which averages 68.0 units, to capture this slight uptick while respecting the broader seasonal low. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P43-P46) averages 68.0 units, marking a significant drop from the autumn baseline (137) and late-autumn baseline (85).
