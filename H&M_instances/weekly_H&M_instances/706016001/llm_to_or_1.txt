Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic high-waisted skinny denim trouser from the Divided Collection. Demand for basic denim is typically stable but fluctuates with seasonal fashion resets. Past demands are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], showing a slight upward trend and an average of approximately 689 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand resolution. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the last 5 demand samples (all available history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volume level (~774 in the last period). Setting N=5 for recent demand context.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch denim trouser. Reviewing Period 1: a shipment of 750 units ordered in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead time = 0), satisfying a demand of 671 units. Current on-hand is 79, with 0 in-transit. Historical demand over the last 6 samples: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671]. The demand appears stable around a mean of ~685. The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed in Period 1. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to capture the local mean and volatility of the last 6 samples (all available history). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time logic.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. We are in Period 3 (Late February). Historical demand over the last 7 periods (5 pre-game, 2 in-game) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673]. The mean demand is approximately 684. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend yet in the February data. Since the system calculates the base stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand, and L=0, we need to ensure mu_hat reflect the one-period demand. I will use the 'default' method for L as it matches the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture all available data points and provide a stable estimate of the current demand regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is early March (2019/3/4). Historical demand for the last 8 periods (including pre-game) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539]. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic fashion item from the Divided Collection. Demand has been relatively stable, with a slight dip in the most recent period (Period 3: 539). The promised lead time is 0, and historical observation (Periods 1, 2, and 3) confirms an actual lead time of 0. I will use the last 5 samples to capture the most recent demand mean and volatility, which averages around 674 units per period. This recent window is enough to account for the slight volatility while staying reactive to potential spring fashion trends.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. Current date is March 11, moving into the spring season. Historical demand data shows a downward trend: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] (Pre-game) followed by [671, 673, 539, 447] (Periods 1-4). The mean demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 582, but the most recent two periods (539 and 447) suggest a cooling off or shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the most recent active trading periods while smoothing out the volatility. This balances our stock levels against the recent decline in demand to minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this denim staple.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. Current date is March 18th. Reviewing historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] and recently observed demand [671, 673, 539, 447, 468], there's a clear downward trend from the initial high levels (~670-770 range) to a lower level (~450-540 range) over the last three periods. This suggests post-launch stabilization or a seasonal cooling in demand for this specific wash/style. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all 5 historical periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this lower regime (Avg \u2248 485) and prevent overstocking as demand softens. L will remain 'default' as the promised 0-period lead time is being consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 3: Average demand decreased from ~680 to ~485 (-28%) following initial observations.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard fashion item. Current date is March 25, 2019. Observed demand over the last 4 periods (P3-P6) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the very early spikes (P1-P2). Specifically, historical demands are [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502]. The decrease from ~670 to ~489 is significant and sustained. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded shipments. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this established lower demand regime (P3-P6) while excluding the early outliers, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in Period 8 (April 1st). Observations from Period 1 to 7 confirm a 0-period lead time (all orders arrived same-period). Demand showed an initial high phase (~670-690 including pre-history) but shifted significantly lower around Period 3. Since the shift, demand has stabilized: the last 5 periods (P3-P7) show demands of [539, 447, 468, 502, 511], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 493.4. Given the date (start of April), we are in the spring season where basic denim demand is typically steady. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 12), so the backend needs to order to restore the base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 0.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in Period 9 (early April). Historical data shows a clear regime shift after Period 2, where demand dropped from ~670 to an average of ~505 over the last 6 periods (P3-P8). However, recent periods (P6-P8) show a steady upward trend (502 -> 511 -> 560), likely corresponding to spring seasonality for denim trousers. In Period 8, we stocked out (demand 560 vs. sales 524), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To prevent further stockouts while responding to the recent upward trend, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the post-drop regime while giving weight to the higher recent consumption. I will set the lead time method to 'calculate' as it accurately reflects the observed 0-period delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering from P3 low point: Avg demand rose from ~485 (P3-P5) to ~524 (P6-P8), with a stockout occurring in P8 at demand 560.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in Period 10 (mid-April). Historical demand analysis shows three distinct phases: initial high demand (avg ~670), a drop in mid-February to early March (avg ~450), and a partial recovery in late March through early April (avg ~524). Period 9 showed a significant dip to 335, which might be a weekly fluctuation rather than a new downward trend, especially given the stockout in Period 8. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded periods. To avoid overreacting to the single low data point in Period 9 while acknowledging the recent recovery trend, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 (Periods 6-9) for mu_hat. This balances the recent recovery (averaging 502, 511, 560) with the recent dip (335), resulting in a mean of 477. This is conservative but safer than using the long-term average or just the last period. I will use the same window for sigma_hat to capture the recent increase in volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is a high-waisted skinny jeans product. Current observation shows a significant drop in demand over the last two periods (P9: 335, P10: 269), diverging from the recovery trend noted in P9. The average demand across P9 and P10 is approximately 302 units, compared to the previous average of ~524. Looking at the dates, we are in late April; the early spring peak may be subsiding. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by 'conclude' messages. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs (currently $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P8-P10) to capture this recent sharp decline in demand while still accounting for the high demand in P8 to maintain a small safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~520 to ~300 (-42%) over the last two periods, following the early spring peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is a high-waisted denim trouser. We are currently observing a sustained downward demand shift that began around Period 9 (early April). The demand over the last three periods (P9: 335, P10: 269, P11: 261) has averaged approximately 288 units, which is significantly lower than the prior regime's average of ~520. This trend aligns with the post-spring peak drop-off for denim trousers. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (L=0). I am selecting the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this most recent low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last 3 periods provide a tight cluster of representative data for the current late-spring trend. The on-hand inventory is 256, which nearly covers the current average demand, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: Avg demand stabilized at ~288 (P9-P11) from ~524 (-45%) marking the post-spring denim decline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 9, which matches the post-Easter/Spring seasonal decline for denim. Recent demand values are: P9=335, P10=269, P11=261, P12=339. The average over these last 4 periods is approximately 301. However, period 12 ended in a small stockout (demand 339, sold 323, 0 on-hand), suggesting demand may be stabilizing or slightly rebounding from its April lows as we enter May. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime (~301 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals (L=0). q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8, which is the service level target. Given the volatility in the last 4 periods (std dev approx 40), setting sigma_hat with N=4 will provide an appropriate safety buffer to prevent the stockout seen in P12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) indicates a significant regime shift starting around Period 9, as recorded in the Carry-over Insights. Since Period 9 (early April), average demand has dropped to approximately 289 units (335, 269, 261, 339, 241), compared to the higher spring peak (~520 units). The current period is May 13, which is post-spring peak for denim in many retail environments, leading to lower, more stabilized demand. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume regime while maintaining responsiveness to the slight volatility observed (e.g., the stockout in P12 due to a demand spike to 339). N=5 is chosen because it covers the entirety of the identified post-shift regime (P9-P13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $618.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a downward demand trend as we move further into late spring/early summer (May 20). Historical demand has dropped significantly from the spring peak (~520 units/period) to a lower level starting around Period 9. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) show demands of 339, 241, and 189, respectively, indicating a continuing softening of demand for this heavier denim style. For Period 15, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration and avoid over-ordering as seasonality shifts away from denim. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will maintain the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is currently 138 units, and the requested parameters will guide the OR backend to place a modest replenishment order to cover next period's lower forecasted demand while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration trend continued through Period 14: Average demand for P12-P14 dropped to ~256 units, reinforcing the post-spring decline in denim interest as summer approaches.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1284.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is experiencing high volatility as it transitions toward summer (late May). Period 15 saw a sharp, unexpected demand spike to 375, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This follows a period of decline (P13: 241, P14: 189). Looking at the history, demand appears to fluctuate between ~190 and ~380 in this late-spring/early-summer phase. The promised lead time is 0, and historical delivery has consistently been 0, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period. To recover from the stockout and handle the current volatility, I will use a shorter window (last 3 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the recent demand average of ~268 but allows for the higher standard deviation observed in the last three periods (189, 241, 375) to buffer against further spikes. L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Volatility spike noted in Period 15 (demand 375 vs previous 189); demand for this denim SKU has not yet fully stabilized at the lower summer level predicted in P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1400.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) has experienced a significant and unexpected demand surge over the last two periods (P15: 375, P16: 533), despite a previous forecast of seasonal decline (summer). The P16 demand of 533 is much higher than the previous 5-period average (~280), resulting in a stockout. With a current on-hand inventory of 0 and promised lead time of 0, I must set parameters to aggressively replenish stock to meet this new high-demand regime. The recent volatility (sigma) is also high. I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture the sharp upward trend from 189 to 533, and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility peak while providing some stability against the earlier lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge detected starting Period 15: Demand rose from 189 (P14) to 533 (P16), reversing the 'summer decline' trend. Average demand for P15-P16 is ~454 units compared to P12-P14 avg of ~256.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is experiencing a significant demand surge starting in Period 15 (May 20), contradicting earlier expectations of a summer decline. The last three periods of demand are 375, 533, and 451, resulting in a three-period average of 453 units. This surge has caused stockouts in Period 15 and 16 before stabilizing slightly in Period 17 (demand 451). I will treat Period 15 as the start of a new high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent uptrend and ensure high service levels to capture profit ($4/unit) while minimizing lost sales, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility estimates. This targets the most recent demand window where the trend reversed.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Period 15-17 demand averaged 453 units, a 77% increase over the Period 12-14 average of 256. This marks a new high-demand regime for early June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) has entered a sustained high-demand regime since Period 15. Demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) has been 375, 533, 451, and 462, averaging approximately 455 units. This follows a significant surge from the previous summer low (P12-P14 avg ~256). The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identify this shift starting at P15. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the game history. To capture this recent regime shift while mitigating the impact of the stockouts in P15 and P16 (which suggest latent demand might have been even higher), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to anchor the forecast on this new level. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current volatility of this high-demand period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15. The recent demand history (P15-P19) shows values of [375, 533, 451, 462, 358], with an average of approximately 436 units. The most recent demand (P19: 358) indicates a slight cooling from the peak (P16: 533), but remains significantly higher than the May average (~256). Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture this current high-demand regime while allowing for the slight downward trend seen in the most recent period to inform the forecast. This ensures sufficient stock for the current baseline while avoiding excessive overstocking as the summer progresses.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a cooling-off phase following a significant late-May/early-June surge. Demand peaked at 533 in P16 and has since steadily declined: 451 (P17), 462 (P18), 358 (P19), to 265 (P20). This suggests the 'high-demand regime' noted in carry-over insights is ending as summer progresses. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 361, while the last 2 periods average 311. Given the decline, using a recent window of N=4 (covering the descent) for mu_hat is appropriate to capture the downward trend without over-reacting to a single week. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1, suggesting a target service level of 80%; the OR backend will calculate the base stock accordingly. On-hand inventory is healthy (231), so the order will naturally be smaller this period to align with the lower demand trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling: The surge identified in P18 has subsided; demand peaked in P16 (533) and has trended downward for 4 consecutive periods to 265 (P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1303.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown significant volatility in recent weeks. After a peak in P16 (533 units) and a subsequent decline to 265 units in P20, demand in P21 saw a moderate rebound to 353 units. This suggests the 'cooling' trend noted in the previous insight might be stabilizing into a mid-summer range rather than a total collapse. Given the date (July 8), we are in a typical summer retail period where denim demand can be erratic. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during these unpredictable bumps against holding costs, I am shifting from the long-term history to a more focused window. I will use the last 4 periods (P18-P21) to capture the current post-peak stabilization level. This window (N=4) yields an average demand of approximately 359.5 units, which aligns well with the most recent observation (353). Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following the early June surge and late June cooling, demand has stabilized in the 260-360 range for P19-P21, averaging ~325 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 23 (July 15). Demand for this skinny denim SKU has shown dynamic shifts throughout the spring and into summer. After a significant early June surge (P15-P18 averaging ~455), the demand leveled off. In the most recent four periods (P19-P22), demand has been 358, 265, 353, and 393, averaging approximately 342 units. The trend suggests demand is currently stabilizing in the mid-300s range rather than continuing the downward 'cooling' trend noted previously. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for all recent periods. I will set L=0 using the default method. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current post-surge stabilization mean of ~342. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent volatility (range 265-393). This ensures the OR backend targets a service level corresponding to a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 while accounting for the recent demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a stable mid-summer demand regime. Analysis of the recent history shows that after the early June surge (P15-P18), demand settled into a consistent range. Specifically, for the last five periods (P19-P23), demand values were [358, 265, 353, 393, 369], yielding a mean of 347.6 units and a standard deviation of 49.3. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show an even tighter and slightly higher clustering [353, 393, 369] with an average of 371.7 units. Given the inventory is quite low (20 on-hand), and the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed by all history), I will set the parameters to reflect this current stability. I'll use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-surge stabilization while maintaining enough sensitivity to the slight upward trend seen in July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for skinny denim has stabilized around a mean of ~322 units over the last 6 periods (P19-P24). While there was a slight dip in P24 (232 units), the preceding units (358, 265, 353, 393, 369) suggest a relatively stable mid-summer regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history. I will utilize a recent_N (N=6) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability while moving past the early June surge. This period (late July) is typically a transition phase before late August back-to-school peaks, so maintaining a base stock geared toward the current 320-330 average is appropriate to balance the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waisted denim skinny jean. Historically, we saw a surge in early June followed by a stabilizing pattern in July (P21-P25) with demand ranging between 232 and 393. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 329 units. As we move into August (P26, Date: 2019/8/05), we are entering the 'Back to School' season, which typically drives a significant increase in demand for basic denim items like skinny jeans. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the stable July base of ~329) but will use an explicit sigma_hat set slightly higher to account for the potential volatility and upward pressure of the August seasonal shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school seasonality anticipated starting August (P26): July demand stabilized at avg ~329 units (P21-P25), transition to potential August peak expected.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 27 (2019/8/12), which marks the heart of the back-to-school season. As anticipated in the previous period, demand is showing signs of recovery: Period 26 demand was 381, significantly above the July average of ~329 and the previous week's 298. Given that this product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', back-to-school is a historically strong driver for this category. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture the current upward momentum while acknowledging historical volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering Periods 24-26) which yields an average demand of 303.6; however, since Period 26 itself was 381 and it is mid-August, I will use an explicit forecast of 420 for mu_hat (representing roughly a 10% increase over the last observed period) to ensure we have sufficient stock for the expected August surge. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (N=5) to reflect the variability seen as we transitioned from the July low to the August increase.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed at Period 26: Demand rose to 381 from a July average of 329 (+16%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-August Back-to-School (BTS) period. Period 27 demand reached a new high for this regime at 493 units, causing a stockout. This confirms the seasonal surge previously anticipated. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture the full magnitude of this BTS surge and prevent further stockouts while maintaining a high service level (calculated quantile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27), which covers the transition and start of the peak. Historical demand for these three periods is [298, 381, 493], showing an aggressive upward trend. Using N=3 will allow the OR backend to quickly adapt to the steep demand slope observed in August for this high-waisted denim SKU.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand peak intensified at Period 27: Demand increased to 493 units, a 30% rise from Period 26 and significantly higher than the July average of 329. Stockout occurred in P27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (superstretch denim) is currently experiencing a sustained Back-to-School demand surge. Period 28 (late August) recorded a demand of 432, followed by 493 in Period 27 and 381 in Period 26. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P26-P28) is ~435 units, significantly higher than the July average of ~329. Given the date is August 26, we are at the peak of the Back-to-School season. History shows lead times have consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capture the current high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~435 unit mean and associated volatility, allowing the OR backend to set a safety stock that handles the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime (P26-P28) stabilized at an average of ~435 units, representing a ~32% increase over the July baseline of ~329 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a back-to-school demand regime. Analysis of the most recent four periods (P26-P29) shows demand values of 381, 493, 432, and 396, resulting in a stable average of 425.5 units. This is significantly higher than the July average of ~329 units. As we enter September (P30), back-to-school demand typically peaks or stabilizes at this higher plateau before shifting into fall trends. Given the consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, I am setting L to default. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat (covering the confirmed P26-P29 regime) and sigma_hat (to capture the volatility of this higher demand period, including the P27 spike). This ensures the base stock reflects current high-demand levels while maintaining a protective buffer for potential further surges.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1872.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (2019/09/02), demand spiked significantly to 740 units, resulting in a stockout (only 468 sold). This represents the likely climax of 'Back-to-School' shopping or a Labor Day event. While the previous regime (P26-P29) averaged ~435 units, this latest observation suggests a higher mean or at least increased volatility as we transition into September. Historical data from early February (P1-P2) also showed high demands around 670-690, suggesting the SKU is capable of sustained high volume. For Period 31, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to incorporate the high P30 demand while balancing it against the late August levels (avg of P26-P30 \u2248 488). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the massive jump in volatility observed in P30. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Significant demand breakout in Period 30 (740 units), a 70% increase over the P26-P29 average. This indicates the peak of late-summer/early-autumn seasonality for denim.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in its peak autumn/back-to-school demand phase. Period 30 and 31 have shown a massive surge (740 and 708 units respectively), which is roughly double the July baseline (~329) and significantly higher than the initial back-to-school surge in August (~435). We have experienced stockouts in the last two periods due to these high volumes. While this peak may start to level off soon as we move into late September, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid further lost sales while the trend is still active. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P29-P31: 396, 740, 708) to capture this recent high-demand regime while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified at Period 30-31: Demand averaged ~724 units, a 66% increase over the P26-P29 back-to-school average of ~435 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in its peak autumn seasonality (late September). Demand shifted significantly at Period 30, with the last three periods (P30-P32) recorded demands of 740, 708, and 707 units respectively. This represents a sustained regime shift compared to the August back-to-school average of ~435. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this new peak level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to specifically weight the current high-demand plateau. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~718 unit average of the last three periods, preventing stockouts during this critical sales window while acknowledging the tight lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a high level of ~718 units for three consecutive periods (P30-P32), following the initial breakout in P30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2940.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an intense autumn/back-to-school peak. In Period 33 (late September), demand exploded to 1428 units, a massive 100% increase over the previous 3-period plateau of ~718 units. This represents a significant seasonal spike, likely driven by late-September shopping events or transition to cooler weather. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the stockout in P33. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, I am shifting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates this new demand level. I will set the forecast based on a weighted view: favoring the recent 1428 observation while acknowledging it may be a single-period extreme outlier. I choose 1000 units as a target mu_hat (for L=0, this covers 1+0 periods) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this higher regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of the last month (P30-P33). Lead time remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak detected at Period 33: Demand surged to 1428 units, doubling the previous Period 30-32 autumn plateau of ~718 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) has entered its autumn peak. Period 33 witnessed a massive demand surge to 1428 units, followed by a correction to 748 units in Period 34. This pattern indicates that P33 was a likely extreme outlier or a short-lived promotional peak, while the underlying seasonal plateau remains high (approx. 720-750 units). The current date is Oct 7, where autumn denim demand usually plateaus before late-autumn cooling. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high-demand autumn phase (P30-P34 avg = 866) without being overly reactive to the P33 localized spike. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility seen during these seasonal shifts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak peaked at Period 33 (1428 units), followed by a return to the Period 30-32 plateau level (~748 units) in Period 34. This suggests a sustained high-demand regime of ~750-850 units for the October period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1899.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a high-volatility autumn peak. After a massive 'super-peak' of 1428 in Period 33, demand has returned to a more stable but still elevated level (748 in P34, 606 in P35). This aligns with the 'autumn plateau' identified in previous carry-over insights. The current on-hand inventory is 525 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, we can afford to be reactive. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the significant shifts from the autumn surge (P31-P35 avg demand \u2248 845) while acknowledging the slight cooling in the most recent period. This approach provides a sufficient base stock for the OR backend to handle the current demand regime without over-ordering as we move deeper into October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn plateau confirmed: Demand following the P33 super-peak (1428) has returned to a high-level baseline, averaging 677 units across P34-P35, suggesting a sustained high-demand regime for October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a sustained autumn plateau following the September peak. Since Period 34, demand has been consistently high but stable: 748 (P34), 606 (P35), and 581 (P36), averaging approximately 645 units. This is a significant shift from the 'super-peak' of 1428 (P33) and the earlier 700+ plateau (P30-P32). To reflect this current stabilization and avoid over-ordering based on the P33 outlier or historical lower levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the P34-P36 period specifically. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current regime's volatility. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods, confirmed by consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn plateau updated at Period 36: Demand has stabilized at a new baseline following the P33 peak, averaging ~645 units over P34-P36. This reflects a transition from early autumn peak to sustained late autumn demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained late autumn demand phase following the September/October peaks. As of Period 37 (Oct 21), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 645 units (P34-P37: 748, 606, 581, 643). Given the current date is Oct 28 (Period 38), we are entering the lead-up to November (Black Friday/Early Winter), but the immediate trend is a stable plateau from the previous 'super-peak'. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 78), so we need to replenish to cover the current demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization (average ~645) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization: Average demand for P34-P37 has settled at ~645 units following the late September super-peak, indicating a high-level baseline for the October/November transition.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the late autumn/early winter season. Historical demand for this Jade HW Skinny Denim SKU has stabilized following the P33 super-peak (1428 units). Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged approximately 648 units (748, 606, 581, 643, 663), showing remarkable stability in the [580, 750] range. We are currently in a high-demand regime compared to the summer baseline. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per the 'conclude' messages. With on-hand inventory at 44 and zero in-transit, we need to order to maintain the base stock level for this stable high-demand period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable late-autumn regime while filtering out the P33 outlier and older data.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Period 34-38 demand has remained stable at an average of ~648 units, following the September peak. This represents the current sustained demand regime for the November transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1722.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a cooling phase following the autumn peak. While the Period 34-38 average was ~648 units, the most recent demand in Period 39 dropped significantly to 485 units. This aligns with typical retail patterns where the late-autumn peak begins to taper off before Black Friday or holiday surges. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I am adjusting mu_hat towards this lower level using a recent_N of 3 (encompassing P37-P39) to capture the trend while maintaining enough stock (on-hand 218 + planned order) to cover the observed variance (~597 units average over the last 3 periods). The OR backend will use the 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) to prevent excessive overstocking as we move further into November.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed at Period 39: Demand dropped to 485 units, a 25% decrease from the previous 5-period average of ~648 units, signaling a transition out of the autumn peak regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim SKU is currently in a post-autumn transition. While Period 39 showed a dip to 485 units, Period 40 saw a rebound to 581 units. Over the last three periods (P38-P40), demand averaged ~576 units, which is lower than the late-autumn peak of ~650 units but higher than the P39 dip. Given the date (Nov 18) and product type (high-waisted denim), we are likely entering the pre-holiday season where demand usually stabilizes or slightly increases before a final end-of-year clearance. The inferred lead time remains stable at 0. To capture the current regime while acknowledging the recent tapering and subsequent minor rebound, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging P38-P40) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during the transition out of the September/October super-peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned from autumn peak (~650 units) to a late-November regime averaging ~576 units (P38-P40), following a temporary dip in P39.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a post-autumn transition. Demand has shifted from a high-peak regime (~650-700 units in October) to a more moderate late-November regime. Analyzing the most recent four periods (P38-P41), the demand values are [663, 485, 581, 547], resulting in an average of 569 units. This is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 41 indicating a level around 576 units. As we move into late November (Date: 2019/11/25), retail demand for denim typically remains steady before the holiday peak/clearance cycle. I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this stabilized post-peak level while excluding the higher October values. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we experienced a massive demand spike of 3100 units, likely corresponding to Black Friday weekend. This resulted in a total stockout of our 632 available units. As of Dec 2 (Period 43), the immediate 'Super-peak' has likely passed, but we are entering the December holiday gifting season. Historically, this SKU (high-waisted skinny denim) sees sustained interest during holiday retail peaks. I am setting mu_hat to 1200 using the 'explicit' method to account for the post-Black Friday 'Cyber Monday' tail and early December holiday demand, which is expected to be significantly higher than the pre-peak average (~576) but lower than the 3100 extreme. sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the extreme variance introduced by the recent spike. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as all previous orders have arrived immediately.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday 'Super-peak' confirmed at Period 42: Demand reached 3100 units, causing a total stockout and significantly exceeding the late-November baseline of ~576 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), demand has reverted to its late-autumn baseline (674 units) following the dramatic Black Friday super-peak in Period 42 (3100 units). Historical data confirms a promised and actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1759 units, largely due to the large safety order placed in Period 43 to recover from the stockout. Given that the Black Friday event is a localized outlier, I am resetting the demand forecasting window to the post-autumn plateau (P34-P41, excluding P42) and the most recent observation. The target service level should remain high, but the OR backend will naturally reduce ordering because the current on-hand inventory (1759) already covers approximately 2.5 periods of the current mean demand (~650-700). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to smooth out the BF outlier while capturing the sustained high demand seen throughout October and November.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand normalization confirmed: Period 43 demand returned to ~674 units, aligning with the late-autumn baseline of ~650 units observed prior to the holiday peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a post-Black Friday stabilization phase (December 16). After the extreme Black Friday surge (P42 demand: 3100) and subsequent replenishment (P43 order: 2433), demand has normalized to ~677 units over the last two periods (P43: 674, P44: 680). This aligns closely with the late-autumn baseline of ~650 units. We currently have 1079 units on hand. With lead time consistently at 0 periods, the current inventory level is sufficient to cover approximately 1.6 periods of normalized demand. However, since the next periods lead into the Christmas/New Year holiday week, we should maintain a baseline near 650-700 units while accounting for potential volatility. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the post-Black Friday average (which includes the normalization) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the variance during this transition. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization confirmed: Demand in P43-P44 has averaged 677 units, returning to the pre-holiday baseline of ~650 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $622.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable post-Black Friday demand regime, with the last three periods of demand (P43-P45) averaging 670 units (674, 680, 657). We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the Christmas/Holiday week. History shows a massive peak occurred during Black Friday (P42), and while a similar 3000+ unit surge is less likely for Christmas for denim, we must maintain a high service level for the holiday transition. On-hand inventory is healthy at 2006 units, covering approximately 3 periods of the current average demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0, and the current regime (P43-P45) is very stable, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the post-holiday baseline while allowing the OR backend to maintain safety stock based on recent volatility. This ensures we don't over-order into the potential January post-holiday slowdown while still being protected for the final week of December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019 (Period 47). We are moving past the Christmas/New Year peak. Observed demand in P46 dropped to 475 units from the post-Black Friday average of ~670 units (P43-P45), signaling the expected end-of-year seasonal tapering for denim. Inventory is currently high (on-hand: 1531) because of a large order in P45 and subsequent demand drop. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs in January, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend from the post-Black Friday peak down to the current tapering (P43-P46). This will allow the OR backend to recalculate a lower base stock and likely result in a zero-unit order for this period until the existing inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed at Period 46: Demand decreased to 475 units from the P43-P45 average of ~670 units (-29%), signaling the end of the holiday peak and transition into the January low season.
