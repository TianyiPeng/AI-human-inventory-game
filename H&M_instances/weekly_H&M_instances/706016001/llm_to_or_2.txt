Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser, a staple fashion item. Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows a slight upward trend (694, 576, 685, 715, 774), with a mean of 688.8. Since promised lead time is 0 and we have no observed history of delays yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat), given the recent upward trend, I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current momentum. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This provides a balanced base stock to meet demand immediately while minimizing unnecessarily high holding costs for this $1.0/unit/period item.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic denim item. Historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows an average of ~689. Period 1 demand was 671. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered P1, arrived P1). Current 'On-hand' is 79, which is insufficient for the next period's expected demand (~690). Since the data is relatively stable, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 historical samples plus Period 1 (N=6). As we have confirmed the actual lead time matches the promise (0), I will use the default lead time method.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic/divided high-waisted denim item. Historical demand (recent 5 samples: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]) plus the first two periods of the game (671, 673) show a steady demand pattern with a mean around 684. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Period 1 and 2 confirm the actual lead time is indeed 0. Current on-hand is low (68). Since demand is remarkably stable and lead time is short and reliable, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 5 pre-game and 2 in-game samples (N=7) to capture the current regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. Current period is 4 (March 4, 2019). Historical demand over the last 8 periods (including pre-game) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539]. The average demand is approximately 666 units. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The drop in demand in Period 3 (539) follows a fairly stable period; March typically sees a transition into spring fashion, but no immediate major spike is expected this week. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent levels while smoothing the recent drop, and 'default' for sigma_hat as the variance remains within a normal range for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1497.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a superstretch denim trouser, generally a year-round staple but potentially subject to early spring softening (February to March). Historical demand samples show [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] which averaged 688.8 units. Observed demand in the first four periods [671, 673, 539, 447] indicates a clear downward trend (avg of P3-P4 is 493). The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true for every order placed so far. Given the sharp decline in demand in the last two weeks, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the falling demand while still protecting against volatility. Sigma_hat is set to default to encompass broader variability since the recent drop is quite steep compared to history. On-hand inventory is 291, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level for the current period's projected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: Average dropped from ~670 to ~490 (-27%), possibly due to post-launch stabilization or seasonal shift in early March.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. We are currently in Period 6 (March 18, 2019). Historical demand shows an initial high (P1: 671, P2: 673) followed by a drop in P3 (539) and stabilization in P4 (447) and P5 (468). This confirms the demand regime shift noted in carry-over insights starting around Period 3. Average demand over the last three periods (P3-P5) is approximately 485. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this stabilized but lower demand level, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~485 units/period following the drop in Period 3 (confirmed by P4-P5 data).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) shows a distinct demand shift. Periods 1-2 averaged ~672 units, while Periods 3-6 stabilized at a lower mean of ~489 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 6. For Period 7 (March 25), demand is expected to remain in this stable 'post-launch' regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the stabilized mean of approx 489 units and recent_N for volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects current behavior rather than the high initial launch volume. This balances the risk of overstocking as we move further into the Spring season.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown a demand stabilization since Period 3. Initial demand was ~670 (P1-P2), then dropped to a regime averaging ~493 units over the last 5 periods (P3: 539, P4: 447, P5: 468, P6: 502, P7: 511). The date is 2019/4/1, entering the spring season for denim. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With on-hand inventory at 12 units and demand trending slightly upwards again over the last two weeks (502 to 511), I will use the recent 5 samples (P3-P7) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime while remaining responsive to the current trend. Lead time remains 'default' (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since P3 at an average of 493 units/period (Std Dev ~36). Current spring season (April) shows slight upward momentum from the P4 low.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in its early spring season (April 8). A demand regime shift occurred at Period 3, dropping from ~670 to ~500. However, the last three periods (P6-P8) show a clear upward trend (502, 511, 560), aligning with spring seasonality as weather warms. In Period 8, we stocked out (on-hand 0, demand 560 > inventory 524), indicating our previous parameters were too lean for this rising demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent upward momentum and prevent further stockouts, I am switching mu_hat to a more aggressive EWMA weighting (gamma=0.7) to favor the most recent high demand of 560. I will also use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture the volatility since the P3 stabilizer while ignoring the initial high-volume launch phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upward in early April (P6: 502, P7: 511, P8: 560), causing a stockout in P8. This confirms a seasonal growth phase post-March stabilization.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) shows high volatility in the last two periods. Period 8 saw a stockout with demand at 560, followed by a sharp drop to 335 in Period 9 (early April). This contradicts the previously identified upward trend and suggests a highly unstable early-spring demand pattern or a data anomaly. With on-hand inventory at 237, we must ensure enough coverage for Period 10 without over-stocking given the recent low demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals (P1-P9). I will use a recent window (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent range (335-560) but allow the backend to recognize the higher uncertainty (sigma_hat) by using the same recent window, which includes both the peak and the recent trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in April: following a peak of 560 in P8, demand dropped to 335 in P9 (-40%), indicating the spring growth trend is non-linear and high-variance.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-variance phase following a mid-April demand drop (P9: 335, P10: 269), contrasted with a spike in early April (P8: 560). Historically, lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 291 units. Given the recent drop in demand, the mean (mu_hat) needs to be adjusted downwards to avoid overstocking while holding enough safety stock to manage the observed volatility. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand has averaged approximately 435 units with high standard deviation. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this recent fluctuation and ensure the OR backend reacts to the lower demand levels while maintaining a buffer for potential spring recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased in mid-April (P9-P10), with demand dropping ~50% from the P8 peak. The seasonal trend is non-linear, requiring responsive parameter updates.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P9: 335, P10: 269, P11: 261) indicates a significant regime shift compared to the earlier Spring peak (P8: 560). The demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 288 units over the last three periods. The 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a apparel item, and the dates (late April) suggest we have passed a spring peak and are entering a more stable demand phase. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to this new lower-volume, lower-volatility regime to avoid over-ordering and excess holding costs while maintaining a service level aligned with the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost (80% critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 9: Average dropped from the high-500s peak to ~288 units/period (-50%), reflecting a transition into late Spring marketing cycles.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift and then stabilization in late April/early May. After a peak in Period 8 (560), the demand settled into a lower regime: P9: 335, P10: 269, P11: 261, P12: 339. The average of these last four periods is approximately 301 units. Period 12 resulted in a stockout (323 sold vs 339 demand), indicating that the extremely low order in P12 (42 units) was insufficient. The current date is May 6th. Historically, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand regime compared to the early spring peak, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the 301-unit average and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to capture the current volatility (~41). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 300+ demand for Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April/early May (P9-P12) at an average of ~301 units, down from the early April peak but higher than the P10-P11 lows.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P9-P13) shows a stabilized regime in late spring (May) following a period of high volatility. The demand sequence [335, 269, 261, 339, 241] yields an average of ~289 units. In the most recent period (P13), demand was 241, and we started Period 14 with 96 on-hand inventory. The lead time consistently remains 0. Given the high volatility observed in April, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current late-spring average (~289) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the current variance. This strategy ensures we maintain enough stock for the current lower-demand regime without over-ordering, while remaining responsive to the fluctuations (241 to 339) seen in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime (P9-P13) stabilized around an average of 289 units/period, characterized by moderate weekly fluctuations (Std Dev ~45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $618.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for May (P13: 241, P14: 189) shows a continued downward trajectory compared to the March/April average. The latest demand of 189 is the lowest recorded in the history of this SKU. This suggests a transition into late-season 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' demand as we approach June. To prevent excess inventory and minimize holding costs (which are $1/unit/period), I am reducing the demand forecast. I am using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (encompassing Periods 11-14: 261, 339, 241, 189) to capture this most recent downward-trending regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand reached a historical low of 189 units. The May average (P13-P14) has dropped to 215 units, indicating a late-spring seasonal decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1240.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-volatility late-spring regime. Demand in Period 15 spiked to 375 units after a significant low of 189 in Period 14, causing another stockout. This indicates that while the overall May average was trending down, there is significant sensitivity to either promotional activity or intermittent localized demand peaks. The confirmed lead time remains 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a reactive window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent upward rebound (P13-P15 avg: 268) while acknowledging the high volatility by using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat (P11-P15) to ensure the service level (q=0.8) is sufficiently protected against these 300+ unit spikes. On-hand is currently 0, so the backend will aim to reach the base stock target immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in late May (Period 15): demand surged to 375 (+98% over P14), confirming that the late-spring decline is punctuated by significant intermittent spikes, leading to frequent stockouts when using longer averaging windows.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is exhibiting high demand volatility entering June (start of summer season). Demand has surged from a mid-May low of 189 to 375 in P15 and 533 in P16, indicating a significant upward seasonal shift or successful marketing campaign. Both P15 and P16 resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand = 0), meaning true demand is likely higher than the observed sales of 310 and 332 respectively. This shift requires a very responsive demand estimation to prevent further lost sales. I am moving to a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike (P14-P16) while acknowledging that demand is now trending back toward early-period levels (>500 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Summer seasonal surge confirmed with demand jumping from ~240 (P13-P14 avg) to >500 units in P16, causing consecutive stockouts. High volatility regime re-entered.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has entered a summer demand regime starting Period 16 (June). Demand in the last two periods was 533 and 451, following a May dip that averaged ~215. This confirms a significant regime shift corresponding to early summer shopping. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent high-demand/high-volatility regime while avoiding the dilution of low May data, I am using a recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the periods since the surge began (P15-P17: 375, 533, 451), providing a mean of 453. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts (observed in P15 and P16) while the service level q (0.8) balances the risk of holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime fully established as of Period 16: average demand increased from ~240 (May) to ~450+ (June start). Volatility remains high, requiring short-window (N=3) parameter estimation to maintain service levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (June 17) demand context: For SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim), we are in a high-demand summer seasonal regime. Demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 533, 451, and 462 respectively, with an average of 482 units. This represents a significant and sustained shift from the May average of ~240. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To address the current high-demand regime and maintain a high service level given the $4.00 profit vs $1.00 holding cost (q=0.8), I will use the recent demand data (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current summer consumption rate rather than being diluted by the lower spring performance.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is in its summer demand regime (commencing Period 16). After a significant surge (P16: 533, P17: 451, P18: 462), demand in Period 19 cooled to 358 units. This indicates that while the average remains high, volatility is significant. To remain responsive to these high-volume summer fluctuations and prevent stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using a short look-back window (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand levels (358, 462, 451), resulting in a mean of approximately 423 units. The reported lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for highly reactive ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in Period 21 (July 1st). Reviewing the history, demand surged in early June (P16-P18 average ~482), identifying a summer seasonal regime. However, the last two periods have shown a significant deceleration (P19: 358, P20: 265), likely signaling early July stabilization after the initial summer spike. The average demand of the last 3 periods is 361.6 units with high variance. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this apparent deceleration while maintaining a service level based on recent summer patterns, I will use a short window (N=3) for demand and volatility estimation. This captures the high values of mid-June while respecting the downward trend of the last two weeks. The backend OR logic will correctly use the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) to determine the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Early July demand showed a cooling trend (P20: 265 units, -26% from P19 and -45% from P18 peak) following the initial June summer surge.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P17-P21) shows a cooling trend from the June peak. While Period 21 saw a rebound to 353 units, the average over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is approximately 325 units, down from the mid-June average of 450+. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the moderately high volatility (Std Dev around 50 in this cooling phase) and the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend needs to balance the risk of stockouts against a cooling mid-summer market. I am selecting a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to remain responsive to the cooling trend identified in the P21 Carry-over Insight while accounting for the most recent demand uptick in Period 21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in mid-July. After a cooling trend in late June (P20: 265), demand has rebounded in early July (P21: 353, P22: 393), leading to a stockout in Period 22. This suggests a mid-summer demand local peak or sustained high volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To address the recent upward movement and stockout risk, I am selecting a recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current upward trend (avg ~337) and sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the significant volatility observed over the last month (range 265 to 393). This more responsive positioning helps recover the service level after the P22 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in July: after cooling to 265 in P20, demand rose to 353 (P21) and 393 (P22), resulting in a stockout. This indicates sustained mid-summer volatility rather than a continued decline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a high-volatility mid-summer demand phase (July). After cooling significantly in Period 20 (265 units), demand has rebounded and stabilized over the last three periods (P21-P23: 353, 393, 369), with an average of approximately 372 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (29 units) with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as confirmed by Period 23 conclude (ordered P23, arrived P23). Given the recent rebound and subsequent leveling off near the 370-unit mark, setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) will target the current stabilized demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (3) to capture the current volatility while avoiding over-responsiveness to the early-July dip or late-June surge.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand (July) has stabilized at a higher plateau than early-July lows, averaging ~370 units over P21-P23 (up from 265 in P20).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (high-waisted skinny denim) is currently in late July. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Demand has shown significant volatility throughout the summer. After a mid-summer plateau averaging ~370 (P21-P23), Period 24 saw a sharp drop to 232 units (-37% from P23), which may indicate the start of a late-summer slowdown or typical weekly fluctuation. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a robust service level. However, to avoid overstocking during a potential downturn, I will use a recent_N window for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime's characteristics. I'll select N=4 (covering P21-P24) to balance the recent high-demand plateau with the latest drop, resulting in a more responsive forecast than the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late July: after averaging ~370 units (P21-P23), Period 24 demand dropped to 232 units (-37%), potentially signaling the end of the mid-summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is entering August (2019/8/5). Looking at the recent July/late-July trend: demands have been 353 (P21), 393 (P22), 369 (P23), 232 (P24), and 298 (P25). The intense mid-summer peak observed in June/early July (averaging ~450+) has cooled to a mid-range regime. The last 5 periods (P21-P25) show an average of 329 units with significant standard deviation (~66). The carry-over insights correctly identified a cooling trend followed by a volatile plateau. For Period 26, I will use a window of N=5 (P21-P25) to capture this most recent post-peak summer stabilization while respecting the underlying volatility. This period's inventory starts with 100 units on-hand; a base stock approach using the recent 5-period mean ensures we stay responsive to the current 250-400 range without over-reacting to the single low of 232 in P24. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (August): Demand has stabilized into a volatile plateau between 230-400 units, averaging ~330 (P21-P25), distinct from the earlier June peak of 450+.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 remains in a volatile late-summer regime. In Period 26 (August 5), demand surged to 381 units from 298 in Period 25 and 232 in Period 24. While the carry-over insights suggest a stabilization around 330 units, recent fluctuations (232 to 381) highlight significant variance. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held. To provide adequate service levels during this erratic phase while accounting for the high volatility, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime (P22-P26: 393, 369, 232, 298, 381) which averages 334.6 units per period. This approach ensures the OR backend responds to the most recent demand level and the heightened standard deviation of the current plateau.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand volatility confirmed: Demand in early August (P26) peaked at 381 units, following a volatile July (range 232-393). The regime average since P22 is approximately 335 units, with significantly higher variance than early-summer stability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for period 27 surged to 493 units, a 29% increase over the previous week and significantly higher than the late-summer average of ~330 units. This mirrors the volatility seen in mid-June and indicates a potential late-August peak or back-to-school surge for denim trousers. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in period 27. To capture this upward shift and ensure a high service level while managing the demonstrated volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a short-window recent_N (N=4) to weight the recent 493 and 381 demand samples heavily. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened variance observed in August (ranging from 232 to 493). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late-August demand surge detected (P27: 493 units), representing a 49% increase over the P24-P25 average. This confirms a high-volatility regime for the late-summer/pre-autumn transition.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-volatility late-summer/pre-autumn transition phase. Period 27 saw a massive spike (493), which dampened inventory and led to a stockout, followed by a sustained high demand in Period 28 (432). Moving into late August / early September (Period 29), we expect these elevated levels to persist as customers shop for fall staples (denim). The recent 3-period average (P26-P28) is ~435 units, which is significantly higher than the previous late-summer plateau of ~330. Given the high volatility (Std Dev approx 56 over the last 5 periods), I am using a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated trend while accounting for the high variance observed in August. This setup ensures the base stock calculation remains responsive to the recent surge without over-reacting to a single peak.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand surge sustained: Average demand for P26-P28 increased to ~435 units (+31% over early August avg of ~330), signaling a transition to higher autumn-related demand for denim staples.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is entering Period 30 (Sept 2). Historically, the late-August transition into September shows sustained high demand for denim trousers (P27: 493, P28: 432, P29: 396), with an average of ~440 units over the last three periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current autumn demand level while accounting for the high volatility seen throughout the summer, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=3) which reflects the current ~440 unit level better than the long-term average. The service level target (critical ratio) is 0.8 ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding cost)), which the OR backend will target using sigma_hat. Using N=3 for both mu and sigma ensures responsiveness to the current seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed (Period 27-29): Average demand for late August stabilized at ~440 units, representing a sustained shift from the mid-August average of ~330.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1928.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand surged to 740 units, a 68% increase over the previous 3-period average (~440). This aligns with the transition into early September (back-to-school and autumn denim shopping spikes). This surge caused a major stockout, as the starting on-hand inventory was only 482. Although the average of the last 3 periods (P28-P30) is 522, the P30 demand of 740 suggests a significant shift or a very high peak that we must chase to avoid further lost sales. I am choosing N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility autumn regime quickly. This will set a higher base stock to accommodate the increased demand level and the high variance observed in early September. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Autumn demand surge confirmed at Period 30: Demand jumped to 740 units, significantly exceeding the previous autumn plateau of ~440. This reflects early September peak retail activity for denim products.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) has entered a peak autumn sales regime in September. Demand for the last two periods (P30: 740, P31: 708) is significantly higher than the August average (~440). Consecutive stockouts have occurred because the order quantities, though increased, did not anticipate the full extent of this seasonal surge. The current date (Sept 16) suggests we are in the middle of a high-demand period for denim staples. Given the immediate lead time (L=0), I need to set mu_hat to reflect this new plateau (approx. 725 units) to capture full demand. Using a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize these recent peak values while accounting for the high volatility observed during regime transitions.

Carry-over insight: September peak confirmed (Period 30-31): Demand has leveled at a high plateau of ~725 units/period, representing the highest sustained volume since February launch.

Demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has averaged 718.33 units (740, 708, 707), a significant shift from the previous average of ~440. This reflects early September seasonal retail strength. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain service levels during this plateau, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new regime (approx 718 per period). Volatility appears to have stabilized relative to the mean in these three periods, but I will use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat as well to capture the current variance around this high plateau, ensuring the OR backend can accommodate potential further spikes.

Carry-over insight: September peak regime stabilized (P30-P32): Demand average increased to ~718 units/period, representing a sustained +63% jump from the late-August average of ~440.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged to 1428 units, a massive 100% increase over the already high September average (~718). This coincided with late September (2019/9/23), likely representing a final peak in autumn/back-to-school or a specific sales event for denim. This resulted in a total stockout. While the September peak was already high, this extreme outlier suggests a highly volatile end-of-month spike. For Period 34 (September 30), I must balance the possibility that this was a one-time outlier against the risk of continued high demand as we enter October. I will use a very short window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent volume jump while moderating the extreme 1428 figure, and use explicit volatility to account for the massive variance seen in the last period to ensure higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Late September demand spike detected (Period 33: 1428 units), doubling the previous September average of ~718 and causing a severe stockout. This indicates extreme volatility at the month-end transition.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 706016001 shows extreme volatility in late September and early October. Following a massive outlier spike of 1428 in Period 33 (which caused a total stockout), demand returned to a more manageable but still high level of 748 in Period 34. This is consistent with the 'September peak' identified in carry-over insights, followed by extreme period-end volatility. For Period 35 (early October), I expect demand to remain in the 700-800 unit range as the autumn denim season continues, but the high standard deviation from the P33 outlier makes traditional mean calculation risky. Using N=3 for mu_hat (averaging P32: 707, P33: 1428, P34: 748) would result in an average of ~961, which provides a necessary buffer against further spikes while acknowledging the recent stabilization at ~750. I am using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to remain highly responsive to this high-volume, high-variance autumn regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: October demand maintains high-volume autumn regime (P34: 748 units), following an extreme month-end spike in P33 (1428 units). Demand is stabilizing at a high plateau of ~750 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in the middle of a high-volume autumn regime. Following a massive demand spike in Period 33 (1428 units), demand has moderated back to a high plateau, with P34 at 748 units and P35 at 606 units. The current average for this autumn phase (P30-P35, excluding the P33 outlier) is approximately 700 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the extreme P33 spike while maintaining a high service level for the sustained autumn demand, I am using a recent window of N=5 (P31-P35). This captures the current high-demand environment (averaging ~838 units including the spike) which provides a safer buffer against the high volatility observed in September/October. Sigma is also calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume regime (P30-P35) stabilized at a mean of ~700-750 units, significantly higher than the summer average. Extreme volatility remains a risk as seen in the P33 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1785.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn high-volume regime (Period 30-35) has stabilized after the extreme late-September spike (P33: 1428). In Oct (P34-P36), demand has settled at 748, 606, and 581 units respectively, averaging ~645 units. This is slightly lower than the initial Sept plateau (~718) but significantly higher than summer levels. I will use a window of N=7 (P30-P36) to capture the autumn regime's properties while smoothing the P33 outlier. This window yields a mean demand of ~787 units (inflated by P33) and high variance. Given the recent descending trend in October (748 -> 606 -> 581), a slightly more responsive approach is needed to avoid overstocking while respecting the seasonality. I'll use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to balance the high-volume autumn data with the recent stabilizing trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: October demand shows a cooling trend within the autumn regime, softening from the 700+ plateau to ~600 units (avg 645 over P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn high-demand regime is showing signs of cooling. After the extreme volatility in late September (P33), demand stabilized around 750 units and has since trended downward to an average of ~610 units over the last three periods (P35-P37: 606, 581, 643). Given the current date (Oct 28), we are moving away from the early autumn peak. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this softening trend while accounting for the remaining volume, I am using a recent window of N=4 for mu_hat (capturing the post-spike stabilization) and N=4 for sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness to the current variance level. This balances the risk of excess inventory during a downturn against the need for a sufficient service level ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost implies an 80% service level target).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Late October cooling trend confirmed. Demand has stabilized at a lower plateau of ~610 units (P35-P37) compared to the 700+ plateau seen in early September/October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has stabilized in late October around a mean of ~630 units (P35-P38: 606, 581, 643, 663). We are now entering November (P39), where early-winter shopping often sustains denim demand before the major Black Friday peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overreacting to the massive September spike while accounting for the recent late-October stabilization, I am using a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime of ~623 average demand and its associated volatility. Current on-hand is low (44), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to meet the base stock requirements for this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Late-October demand regime (P35-P38) stabilized at ~623 units/period with lower volatility compared to the September autumn peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1770.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand in the late October/early November regime (P35-P39) has stabilized at a lower plateau of approximately 595 units (calculated from P35-P39: 606, 581, 643, 663, 485), down from the 700+ September peaks. Period 39 shows a further dip to 485 units, which may signal a pre-holiday cooling or a new lower regime. Given the High-waisted denim category, we expect volume to potentially increase again as we approach late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), but current evidence supports a stabilized mean of ~600 with moderate volatility. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilization while remaining responsive to the P39 dip, and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the current regime's variance.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November demand regime (P35-P39): Demand has stabilized at a lower autumn plateau of ~595 units, down ~15% from the early autumn peak of ~700, though early November (P39) showed a sharper decline to 485 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a late-autumn regime (mid-November), showing a stabilization around a lower plateau compared to the September/October peaks. Last period's demand (P40) was 581, moving back toward the established mean of ~595 following a brief dip to 485 in P39. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the service level against holding costs in this transition phase, I will use a period (N=6) that captures the recent autumn plateau (P35-P40) for demand and volatility estimation. This window covers the shifts from early October to mid-November, providing enough signal to handle the moderate weekly fluctuations observed recently (485 to 663 range).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a stable late-autumn regime (November). Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 485, 581, and 547, averaging 537.7 units. This represents a slight decline from the early autumn peak (~700-750) and the mid-October plateau (~620). The current date is 2019/11/25, approaching the transition to December. While a Black Friday or holiday surge is possible, the immediate historical trend suggests a stabilization around the mid-500s. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to remain responsive to this specific November plateau while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed (Std Dev approx 48 in this window). The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable per all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Late-November demand regime (P39-P41) stabilized at an average of ~538 units, confirming a ~14% decrease from the late-October plateau of ~623.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we observed an extreme demand spike of 3,100 units, likely due to a massive Black Friday or Cyber Monday promotion. This follows a period of stability around 538 units. While the spike is massive, it is likely a transient event based on the date. However, since actual lead time remains 0, the risk of stockout if demand remains high is significant. Historical month-end peaks (P33: 1428) suggest that volatility is extreme. I will use a short recent_N (N=3) to incorporate this new mean/variance into the OR calculation, which will cause the base stock to respond to the spike without assuming the 3100 units is the new permanent plateau.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike in Period 42 (3,100 units) confirmed as a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event; historical data suggests this is transient but high-volume autumn/winter peaks are possible.

Daily Reward (R_t): $728.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand geography is dominated by the extreme Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike in P42 (3,100 units). However, P43 demand (674 units) shows a return to the high-volume autumn/winter baseline observed prior to the spike. For P44 (Dec 9), we are in the peak holiday season. While the extreme P42 spike should be treated as an outlier to avoid excessive overstocking (holding cost is $1.0 vs profit $4.0), the baseline has shifted upward from the November average (~530) to a December level (~670+). I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the shift from November to December while including the P42 spike to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for significant December volatility. I will use N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a more stable but reactive volatility estimate given the recent extreme variance. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (starting P43) stabilized at a higher baseline (~670) compared to November (~530), following the transient P42 Black Friday spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows stabilization following the extreme Black Friday spike in Period 42 (3,100 units). Demand in Period 43 (674) and Period 44 (680) is consistent with a higher December baseline, averaging 677 units over the last two periods. The current on-hand inventory of 1,288 units is sufficient to cover approximately two weeks of this current demand level. Given that the promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been observed as 0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover Period 45's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this post-spike December stabilization (677 units), and N=2 for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of these normal operating weeks compared to the outlier spike in Period 42. This ensures we don't over-order based on the transient Black Friday volume while maintaining a healthy service level for the remaining December weeks.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P43-P44) stabilized at ~677 units/period with significantly lower volatility (Std Dev ~4) compared to the late-November spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/23. We are in the late December holiday period. After the massive Black Friday spike (P42), demand has stabilized into a consistent December regime. Observations from P43-P45 show demand values of 674, 680, and 657, which are very stable (mean ~670, low variance). The high on-hand inventory (631) from the P43 order is nearly depleted by this week's forecasted demand. To maintain the service level while accounting for the current stability, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike December plateau. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1694.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a post-peak holiday stabilization phase in late December. Period 46 saw demand drop to 475 units, a significant decrease from the early December plateau of ~670-680 units. This aligns with post-Christmas retail trends where demand typically cools. The current inventory (On-hand: 206) is insufficient to cover the expected demand for Period 47. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently reliable, I will set mu_hat using a recent window (N=3) which averages ~604 units (including the 475 drop). This prevents overreacting to a single drop while acknowledging the cooling trend. Sigma_hat is set using a slightly longer window (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen throughout December (including the steady mid-month and the recent drop), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs given the $1/unit/period cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling detected starting Period 46: Demand dropped to 475 units from a December average of ~670 (-29%), signaling a shift towards January seasonal lows.
