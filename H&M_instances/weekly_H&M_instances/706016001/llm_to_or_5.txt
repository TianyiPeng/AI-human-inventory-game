Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted jean. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (roughly the last month) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], showing a relatively stable trend with a slight recent uptick. The mean is 688.8 and the standard deviation is 72.3. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no observation for the lead time yet, I will use the default (0). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent behavior while excluding older potentially irrelevant data, though currently all 5 samples are used. The backend will calculate mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std based on these samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which is a wardrobe staple (super-skinny high-waisted denim). The date is mid-February, typically a stable period for denim before spring transitions. Historical demand data shows [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], and Period 1's actual demand was 671, which aligns well with the previous 5-period mean of ~689. Lead time is confirmed as 0 (promised 0, actual Period 1 arrived immediately). On-hand is low (79 units) after a significant Period 1 demand. To ensure we meet next period's demand, I will set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (N=6, including P1) and set L to default (0). Given the consistent demand pattern, 'default' methods for mu and sigma are appropriate until a shift is detected.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' trouser, a core wardrobe staple. The current date is Feb 25th, which is late winter/early spring. Historical demand for the last five periods (seed data + P1-P2) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673]. The mean demand is approximately 684. Both observed lead times in P1 and P2 were 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand is relatively stable with low volatility. I will use a recent window of N=5 samples to capture the most representative demand (mean ~703 for the last 5, including seed and game history). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 will effectively capture the current regime while maintaining a tight service level for this high-volume item.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in the beginning of the spring season (March). Historical demand shows a mix of values: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] prior to observation, and [671, 673, 539] in the first three periods. The average demand across all 8 data points is approximately 665. The recent dip to 539 in Period 3 might be a random fluctuation rather than a trend change, but to remain responsive I will use recent_N (N=5) to weight recent history more heavily. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on arrivals in P1, P2, and P3. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers immediate demand, with a high service level since profit ($4) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. We are entering Period 5 (early March). Looking at previous demands [671, 673, 539, 447], there is a clear downward trend from the initial (~670) to the current (~450) range. This suggests the initial February demand might have been a peak or early-season surge that is now cooling. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0 sessions (arrived=ordered within the same period). Given the significant decrease in demand over the last 4 weeks (from 671 to 447), using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is appropriate to capture the current lower demand regime and avoid overstocking while we have 301 units on hand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the last 3 samples (673, 539, 447), which averages 553, providing a safer buffer than the all-time mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand decreased from ~670 (avg P1-P2) to ~493 (avg P3-P4), a 26% reduction.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18 (Period 6). The SKU 706016001 (Skinny denim jeans) shows a significant demand drop that started in Period 3. Initial average demand was ~672 (P1-P2), which dropped to an average of ~485 over P3-P5. The last three periods of demand are [539, 447, 468]. Observed lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 periods. Since the demand shift is sustained (3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average demand ~485, so 1+0 * 485 = 485) to avoid over-ordering based on the higher historical start. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue tracking potential lead time drifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand decreased from ~672 (avg P1-P2) to ~485 (avg P3-P5), a 28% reduction sustained over 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502] shows a clear transition from a high-demand regime (~672) to a lower, stabilized regime around ~489 (Periods 3-6). The product is 'High-waisted skinny denim', which typically has stable demand, but we observe a significant ~27% drop that has now persisted for 4 periods. Since the promised lead time L=0 is consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period), I will maintain L=0. To calibrate the OR backend to this new demand level, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing only the post-drop periods (P3-P6) to prevent over-ordering based on the initial high-demand phase. This should align the base stock with the current sales velocity while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 3-6 average demand is 489 units, representing a sustained ~27% decrease from the first two periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) has entered a stable demand regime starting around Period 3. Historical demands are [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502, 511]. The first two periods averaged ~672, while the last five periods (P3-P7) averaged 493.4 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (12 units) with zero in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~493) and the current volatility, while keeping L at 'default' (0) as verified by all historical conclusions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2096.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) shows a clear shift. After an initial high demand (avg: 672), demand settled into a lower regime (avg: 507 for P3-P8). However, the most recent three periods (P6-P8) show a steady upward trend (502, 511, 560), likely reflecting a transition into the spring retail season (Current date: April 8). In Period 8, we stocked out (sold 524 but demand was 560), indicating the current safety stock and base stock levels were too low for the accelerating demand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To address the stockout and capitalize on the upward trend, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent growth and increasing sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P4-P8) to reflect the recent volatility and demand creep. This should increase the base stock level to prevent further lost sales while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand is recovering from the P3-P5 slump; P6-P8 average demand is 524, with P8 seeing a season-high 560 causing a stockout. Monitoring for a sustained spring seasonal upturn.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in Period 10 (mid-April). Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop in Period 9 (335 units) compared to the previous three periods (P6-P8 average: 524). This decline contradicts the initial expectation of a spring upturn previously identified in Period 9's carry-over insight. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the volatility in the recent four periods (502, 511, 560, 335), I will use a larger sample window (recent_N=7) for mu_hat to smooth out the outlier-like drop in Period 9 while still capturing the downward trend from the early season highs. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to account for the increased variance seen in the recent stockout and subsequent demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand recovery failed in Period 9: Demand dropped to 335 units after a three-period upward trend (avg 524), indicating high volatility in the spring season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim trousers) is currently in a downward demand trend as we move further into spring (late April). Demand has dropped significantly over the last two periods (335 in P9 and 269 in P10) compared to the late March peak of 560. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 275 units. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which I will continue to assume. Given the recent volatility and the clear evidence that the high demand from late March did not sustain into April, I am focusing on the most recent demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this cooling trend and avoid over-ordering, as the holding cost ($1.0) is significant relative to profit ($4.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak demand decline. Average demand for P9-P10 is 302 units, a 43% decrease from the P6-P8 average of 524.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a lower demand regime following a spring peak in early April (P8). The demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) has averaged 288 units, which is significantly lower than the P6-P8 average of 524 units. The date is now late April (P12: 2019/4/29). Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 256 units on-hand. Given the recent demand stabilization at a lower level (~260-335 units over P9-P11), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this new lower-demand baseline (mean of P9-P11 is 288) and set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the most recent volatility. This prevents overstocking as the peak season for this item appears to have passed.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: P9-P11 average demand is 288 units, a 45% decrease from the P6-P8 peak period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P9-P12) shows a low-demand regime with values [335, 269, 261, 339]. The average over these 4 periods is 301, which is significantly lower than the P1-P8 average. Period 12 ended with a stockout (demand 339, sold 323), indicating that our previous order was slightly too conservative. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim, which likely sees softer demand as the weather warms into May. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current trend while providing enough stock to cover the slight uptick seen in Period 12. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent delivery history. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to reflect the current volatility in this lower-demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 9 to 13 is 289 units, which is a significant drop from the early periods. Period 13 demand was 241, and Period 12's stockout at 323 units indicates that demand remains volatile but generally below 300 units in the current spring season. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded cycles. For Period 14, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the recent demand drop (avg 289) while accounting for the high volatility seen in Period 12. Using recent_N=5 captures the regime shift that started around Period 9. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period performance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime confirmed: P9-P13 average demand is 289 units (vs ~670 in P1-P2), despite a brief stock-out spike in P12.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is exhibiting a sustained downward trend as we move further into the late spring/early summer season. The average demand for the last six periods (P9-P14) is approximately 272 units, which is significantly lower than the early-period averages. The most recent demand was 189 units, representing the lowest recorded demand for this SKU. There is no evidence of lead-time disruption; actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs in this low-demand environment while maintaining a safety buffer against the volatility seen in Period 12, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (P9-P14) to capture the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Low-demand regime intensified: P14 demand of 189 is a new series low; P9-P14 average is 272 units, confirming a sustained decline from the mid-spring peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) experienced a demand spike in Period 15 (375 units) following a period of low demand (P14: 189). This resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with promised lead time. The demand pattern shows high volatility as we move into late May (P15: May 20). Given the sudden jump from a low of 189 to 375, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (P13-P15) to capture the current upward trend while being cautious of the high variance. Period 15's demand (375) is significantly higher than the previous stagnant regime (avg ~272), suggesting a possible early summer seasonal lift.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility update: Period 15 demand spiked to 375, breaking the sustained low-demand regime (avg ~272, P9-P14). Monitoring to determine if this is a seasonal upturn or isolated volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is exhibiting high demand volatility as we enter June. Demand for Period 16 jumped to 533 units, following a spike to 375 in Period 15, both resulting in stockouts. This confirms a significant upward trend compared to the low-demand regime seen in Periods 9-14 (avg ~272). The current date is 2019/06/03. Historically, summer transitions in fashion retail often see spikes in washed denim/trousers. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this sharp rebound and avoid further stockouts, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for demand and volatility. This focuses on the most recent behavior (P14-P16: 189, 375, 533) where the average is 365, which provides a more aggressive safety cushion than the long-term average while acknowledging the upward momentum.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand upturn confirmed: P15-P16 demand (avg 454) represents a 67% increase over the P9-P14 average (272), leading to consecutive stockouts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) has entered a sustained seasonal upturn as of early June. Demand in Period 15 was 375, Period 16 was 533, and Period 17 was 451, resulting in two stockouts in the last three periods. The average demand for this three-period 'high' regime is 453 units, compared to the previous 'low' regime (P9-P14) which averaged ~272 units. We are now in June, typically a high-demand period for core denim styles. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this recovery and prevent further stockouts, I will use a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=3 to anchor expectations on the current high-demand level (avg 453). sigma_hat will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with this volume shift, allowing the service level (0.80 based on $4 profit/$1 holding) to calculate a safer base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Sustained seasonal demand upturn for June confirmed: Average demand for P15-P17 is 453 units, a 66% increase over the P9-P14 average of 272.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a sustained seasonal demand upturn for June. Analysis of the recent history shows a clear regime shift: the average demand for Period 15-18 is 455 units (375, 533, 451, 462), which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand period (avg ~272). The current on-hand inventory is 58 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period). To maintain high service levels during this peak, I am selecting for mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this June demand level accurately, while reverting sigma_hat to a slightly longer window (N=5) to account for the volatility seen in the jump from Period 14 to Period 15.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) is currently in a high-demand summer phase (June). While earlier periods (P9-P14) saw a low-demand regime (avg ~272), demand since P15 has jumped significantly. The average demand for the last five periods (P15-P19) is 435.8 units, though P19 saw a slight dip to 358. Given the product type and the date (late June), volatility is expected. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent summer demand level, but use a slightly larger window (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed between P15 and P19 (ranging from 358 to 533). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order since P1 arriving in the same period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) is currently in Period 21 (2019/07/01). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand demand has moderated after the June peak (periods 15-18 average: 455), with Period 19 (358) and Period 20 (265) showing a clear downward trend as the summer season progresses. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P15-P20) is 407 units, but the last two periods suggest a shift to a lower volume. Considering the most recent demand of 265 units and current on-hand inventory of 264, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent high-volume window while accounting for the immediate deceleration. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the significant volatility observed between the 533 peak and the 265 trough. This provides a buffer against the high variance seen in this product's lifecycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated in late June: After a June peak (avg ~455, P15-P18), demand decreased to 358 (P19) and 265 (P20), suggesting the summer seasonal peak has passed.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is moving into early July. Historically, demand peaked in June (avg ~455, P15-P18) and has since entered a moderating phase. Demands for P19-P21 were 358, 265, and 353 respectively. The average for this recent 3-period moderated regime is approximately 325 units. While Period 21 saw a slight uptick from Period 20, the overall trend is lower than the June peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average ~325) to reflect this post-peak stabilization. Sigma_hat is also updated to recent_N=3 to capture the current volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed; average demand for P19-P21 is 325 units, down from the June average of ~455.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) is moving deeper into the summer season (mid-July). Analysis of recent demand shows high volatility: Period 21 was 353 units and Period 22 was 393 units, both exceeding the previous stabilization average of 325 units. The stockout in Period 22 resulted from an underestimation of this late-summer demand resilience. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and handle the current demand level, I will shift the lookback period (N) to 4 (Periods 19-22) to capture the recent range of 265 to 393 units (Avg: 342.25). This target base stock balances the risk of further stockouts against the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand volatility observed in July; demand for P21-P22 (avg 373) is significantly higher than the early July stabilization estimate of 325, indicating a potential mid-summer demand plateau rather than a sharp decline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a mid-to-late summer demand phase. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P19-P23), demand has been 358, 265, 353, 393, and 369. The average of these 5 periods is approximately 348 units. This indicates that the earlier expectation of a sharp post-June decline was premature; instead, demand has stabilized into a 'mid-summer plateau.' The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 20 units and a recent demand average of ~350, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this stabilized plateau and maintain a high service level, especially since Period 22 resulted in a stockout. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the recent volatility observed between P20 (265) and P22 (393).

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Mid-summer demand plateau confirmed; demand for P19-P23 averaged 348 units, showing a stabilization compared to the early-July decline fears and June peaks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a late-July period (P25). Historical demand analysis shows a June peak (~455 units), followed by a moderated July plateau. Recent demand (P21-P24) has been [353, 393, 369, 232], averaging 337 units. The sharp drop to 232 in P24 suggests a potential transition out of the summer plateau into a lower late-summer demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for this 'superstretch denim' item, I will use a shorter window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the recent stabilization and the latest downward shift. This balances the higher early-July demand with the most recent lower observation.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Potential late-summer demand decline; demand dropped from a mid-summer average of ~370 (P21-P23) to 232 in P24, a 37% decrease. Monitoring for a sustained new lower regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last period (P25) was 298 units, which is higher than the previous trough of 232 (P24) but still shows a general cooling trend from the mid-summer peak (avg ~370, P21-P23). Since we are moving into August (2019/8/5), denim demand often exhibits volatility before potential back-to-school upticks. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage this uncertain late-summer transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covering P21-P25) to capture the recent moderation (avg of P21-P25 is approx 329). I will use sigma_hat with N=7 to incorporate enough history to account for the volatility seen throughout July. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during minor late-summer spikes against the holding costs of a slowing season.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Late-summer demand moderation confirmed; average demand for P21-P25 is 329 units, reflecting a decrease from the mid-July plateau (~370) but remaining above the P24 low of 232.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is a denim trouser item. Data shows actual lead time remains 0 periods. Current date is mid-August, historically a transition period from late summer to fall. In Period 26, demand spiked to 381 units, up from 298 in Period 25 and 232 in Period 24, indicating either high late-summer volatility or a preliminary shift toward pre-fall demand. The last 3 periods (P24-P26) average 304 units, while the last 5 periods (P22-P26) average 315 units. Given the recent stockout in Period 26 and the upward movement from the P24 low, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (average ~315) to capture this moderate stabilization while allowing for the recent uptick. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed between P24 and P26. This approach aims to prevent stockouts if the P26 demand levels persist into the next week while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand returns to the P24-P25 average.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Seasonal volatility noted in August; demand recovered from P24 low (232) to P26 high (381), resulting in a stockout. Monitoring for a sustained high-300s demand regime or fall transition.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is experiencing a late-August demand surge. Demand in Period 27 hit 493 units, causing a stockout after a previous stockout in Period 26 (demand 381). This upward trend (P24: 232, P25: 298, P26: 381, P27: 493) suggests a significant seasonal shift, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' shopping or fall transitions for denim products. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is approximately 391 units, but the most recent observation (493) indicates the peak may be higher. To prevent further lost sales while balancing the $1.00 holding cost against $4.00 profit (implying an 80% service level target), I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current momentum, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P24-P27), rising from 232 to 493 units (+112%), leading to consecutive stockouts in P26 and P27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a significant demand surge in late August (Periods 26-28), with demand values of 381, 493, and 432. This represents a 67% increase over the previous late-summer average (~265). We are currently in a high-demand regime, likely driven by 'Back to School' shopping as the date is August 26th. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. To capture this recent surge while maintaining a buffer against the high volatility observed in previous seasonal transitions (like April), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~435) to prioritize current demand levels and prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to reflect the heightened volatility (std ~56) during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: Average demand for P26-P28 is 435 units, a 67% increase over the P24-P25 average (265). High volatility continues with consecutive stockouts in P26-P27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1497.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P26-P29) shows a sustained high-demand regime, likely driven by the back-to-school season for denim trousers. Demand for the last four periods was [381, 493, 432, 396], yielding an average of 425.5 units. While Period 29 shows a slight tapering from the peak of 493 in Period 27, it remains significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~330. Promised lead time is 0 and has remained consistent at 0 throughout the history. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this current late-August/early-September demand level (averaging ~426). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current high volatility (std of recent samples is ~48). This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand while the OR backend's service level logic (based on profit=$4, holding cost=$1) targets an 80% service level to prevent further stockouts seen in P26-P27.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime stable: Average demand P26-P29 is 426 units (range 381-493), confirming a sustained high-demand period compared to the July average of ~330.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny high-waisted denim) experienced a massive demand surge in Period 30 (740 units), which is significantly higher than the previous 'back-to-school' average of ~426 units (P26-P29). This spike correlates with the transition into early September, likely driven by final back-to-school shopping or fall fashion resets. Because the stock completely exhausted (sold 468, demand 740), the current base stock must be aggressively adjusted to capture this higher regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the elevated late-August/early-September demand level (avg ~488) while acknowledging the extreme P30 spike. However, since P30 is nearly double the recent average, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for this heightened volatility and prevent further stockouts. The lead time remains 0 based on consistent historical performance (P1-P30 arrived same-period).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Late-summer/Early-fall demand surge: Demand spiked to 740 units in Period 30, a 73% increase over the P26-P29 average (426). This indicates a potential new high-demand regime for September.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a high-demand back-to-school/early-fall peak. Period 30 demand was 740 and Period 31 demand was 708, both significantly higher than the August average (approx. 430). The last two periods show a consistent shift to a 700+ unit regime. Using N=2 for mu_hat would be too aggressive and volatile; instead, I set mu_hat to 725 units (average of P30-P31) using the explicit method to ensure the OR backend targets this new ceiling. This is critical because on-hand is currently 0 due to consecutive stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (50) to account for the increased volatility seen during these high-volume spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Sustained September peak confirmed; demand for P30-P31 averaged 724 units, a 70% increase over the August 'back-to-school' average of 426 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a high-demand September peak. Historical data for Periods 30-32 shows demands of 740, 708, and 707, confirming a sustained high-demand regime (mean = 718.3) compared to the August 'back-to-school' average of ~426. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this significant regime shift and prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P30 and P31), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P30-P32). This N=3 selection targets the specific September peak period identified in the carry-over insights. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected high demand for Period 33 while accounting for the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: September high-demand regime confirmed: P30-P32 demand average is 718 units (range 707-740), representing a 68% increase over the August average of 426.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (late September), demand suddenly exploded to 1428 units, a 100% increase over the already high September average (718 units). This spike coincides with late September/early October, often a peak period for 'Divided Collection' (youth fashion) autumn sales. Given the consecutive stockouts in P30, P31, and now P33, the current base stock logic is under-ordering for these sudden step-changes. I am shifting to an explicit forecast for Period 34 to capture this massive regime shift. I will set mu_hat to 1400 to account for this new heightened demand level. Since the lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, I will continue using the default (promised) lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Major autumn demand surge detected. P33 demand (1428) is 100% higher than the P30-P32 average (718), indicating a potential peak for the autumn denim season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2041.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we saw a massive demand spike to 1428 units, which led to a stockout. In Period 34, demand moderated back to 748 units, which is consistent with the high-demand September regime (avg ~718). However, the seasonal context (October, autumn high-waisted denim) suggests that demand will likely remain elevated or potentially peak again as the weather cools. The OR backend ordered 1699 units in Period 34 to cover the previous spike, resulting in an on-hand inventory of 951 units for Period 35. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against another potential spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering back to Period 30), which averages approximately 866 units. This provides a buffer above the current average while acknowledging the volatility seen in Period 33. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak update: After the extreme outlier in Period 33 (1428 units), demand in Period 34 returned to the high September baseline (748 units). Average demand for P30-P34 is 866 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in its autumn peak season (October). Demand in Period 35 was 606 units, following a stabilized high-demand regime in September (avg ~720) and an extreme outlier in late September (1428). The autumn peak seems to be moderating slightly from the September highs but remains significantly elevated compared to summer levels. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand autumn window (P30-P35), which averages 822 units. This N=6 window includes the 1428 outlier; however, given the stockouts seen throughout this period, a conservative approach to demand estimation is necessary to ensure availability. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a service level target of 80%, meaning we should lean towards sufficient stock rather than aggressive minimization.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak stabilization: Period 30-35 average demand is 822 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for the fall season, though slightly lower than the extreme P33 peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in its autumn peak season. While Period 33 was an extreme outlier (1,428 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P34-P36) at an average of 645 units (748, 606, 581). This suggests the hyper-peak from late September has slightly cooled into a high-demand October baseline. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the P33 outlier while still maintaining a high service level for the fall season, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this post-outlier stabilization (avg ~645). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) will account for the current volatility in this stabilized range without being skewed by the massive jump in P33.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: After the Period 33 peak (1428), demand has stabilized at a lower but still high level of ~645 units (P34-P36 average), representing a 22% decline from the broader P30-P34 average of 822 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a high-demand autumn regime. Based on the most recent 4 periods (P34-P37) following the extreme outlier in P33, demand has stabilized with an average of 644.5 units per period. The standard deviation over this same localized period is approximately 74 units. While the carry-over insights correctly identified a decline from the P30-P34 average (which included the 1428 outlier), the current baseline remains high compared to summer levels. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. By using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4, I capture the stabilizing autumn baseline without the distortion of the P33 peak, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive inventory from outlier-driven forecasts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized into a high-autumn regime following the major September/October surges. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 648 units (748, 606, 581, 643, 663), excluding the massive P33 outlier. This average is consistent with the 'Autumn demand stabilization' insight recorded in Period 37. As we move into November, we should maintain a base stock reflecting this stable but high demand level (~650 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this specific post-peak autumn regime while smoothing out the earlier extreme volatility, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), which perfectly covers the period since the stabilization began.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P34-P38 is 648 units (range 581-748), following the extreme volatility of late September. This represents the steady autumn baseline for this SKU.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (High-waisted jeans) is currently in its autumn demand phase. Following a massive spike in late September (P33), demand has stabilized. For the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 621 units (748, 606, 581, 643, 663, 485). The most recent observation (P39) was 485 units, which is lower than the previous sub-regime average of ~650, potentially signaling the start of a late-autumn decline as we move into mid-November. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of a demand slowdown with the need to maintain service levels for denim, I will use a recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization level while allowing the most recent lower data point to pull the average down slightly. Sigma_hat remains on recent_N=6 to reflect the current period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand moderation: Average demand for P34-P39 is 621 units, showing a 24% reduction from the early autumn (P30-P34) average of 822 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Historical demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has stabilized after a massive September/October peak. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P34-P40, excluding the P33 outlier) is approximately 616 units. However, the most recent demand (P40) was 581, and the average for the last three periods (P38-P40) is 576. This suggests a slight downward trajectory or stabilization around the high-500s mark as the fall peak fades. On-hand inventory is 115, with zero units in transit. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' autumn regime while filtering out the unique P33 outlier. This provides a balance between the high autumnal baseline and the recent moderate decline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Analyzed demand for SKU 706016001 shows a stabilization following the autumn peak. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has averaged 583 units, which is a decline from the early autumn levels around 822 units. The most recent three periods (P39-P41) average 538 units, suggesting a potential further moderation as we move towards late November. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To balance the relatively high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($4.0), and considering the slight downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~538) to avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient service levels. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand moderation confirmed: Average demand for P39-P41 is 538 units, down from the P34-P38 average of 648 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), we observed a massive demand spike of 3,100 units, which coincides with Black Friday week. This SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is highly sensitive to sales events, as seen previously in Period 33. The stockout was unavoidable due to the sheer volume of the spike. Moving into Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are in the Cyber Monday/early December holiday shopping period. Historical data from Period 1-2 (Feb) showed demand in the 600s, and the recent autumn baseline (P39-P41) was around 538 units. However, given the extreme volatility of the holiday season and the potential for a Cyber Monday 'hangover' or sustained gift-buying, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the pre-spike baseline and the spike itself weighted, while using an explicit L of 0 as delivery remains reliable. Sigma_hat will be set explicitly high to account for the extreme variance introduced by the 3,100-unit outlier, ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock to prevent further stockouts during the December peak.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 3,100 units, a 476% increase over the P39-P41 average (538). This confirms extreme seasonal sensitivity for this SKU during major retail events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in the post-Black Friday (P42) period. In Period 42, demand spiked to 3,100 units due to the major sale event, leading to a stockout. Period 43 demand retreated to 674 units, which aligns with the late-autumn baseline (P34-P41 avg ~600) rather than the extreme peak. For Period 44 (Dec 9), we expect demand to remain at this 'holiday baseline' until the next potential spike closer to Christmas. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the extreme P42 outlier while maintaining high service levels for the holiday season, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 (covering P39-P43: 485, 581, 547, 3100, 674). This balances the extreme spike and the recent stabilization. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 350 to provide a buffer against holiday volatility without over-indexing on the 3,100 outlier which would otherwise inflate safety stock excessively.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization: Period 43 demand (674) confirms a return to the pre-spike baseline (avg ~600 in late autumn) rather than a sustained 3000+ level.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the post-Black Friday period (Dec 16). After the extreme spike in P42 (3,100 units), demand has stabilized around the 670-680 range for the last two periods (P43-P44). This aligns with the late-autumn baseline of approximately 600-650 units observed prior to the spike. Lead time remains consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 835 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected demand for Period 45 without a new order, as the backend base-stock calculation (with mu_hat around 680 and z-score) will likely result in a target below current inventory + pipeline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 (averaging P43 and P44) to capture the immediate post-spike stabilization level, and L to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1673.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday period but approaching the late December holiday peak. Recent demand history (P43-P45) shows stabilization around 670 units (674, 680, 657). While the immediate post-Black Friday surge has subsided, late December usually sees a minor holiday lift for denim before the January lull. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 955 units. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the post-spike baseline (approx 670 units), which accurately reflects current steady-state demand without the extreme Black Friday noise. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the broader volatility of the fall season, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer for potential year-end demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Final year-end demand stabilization confirmed; P43-P45 demand averages 670 units, establishing a clear baseline after the Nov 22nd Black Friday extreme spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the final period of the year. Demand in the most recent periods (P43-P46) has averaged 621.5 units, showing a slight post-holiday decline compared to the pre-Black Friday autumn average (~670). Specifically, P46 demand dropped to 475. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Inventory on hand is 548 units. Given that this is the final decision period and the product shows a cooling trend at year-end, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period regime (post-Black Friday) to capture the current demand level of approximately 620 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current post-holiday volatility. Setting L to default (0).
