Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) vs profit $2/unit, so avoid large safety stock. Order enough to meet expected period demand while minimizing leftover inventory.

{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 17 (2019-10-28).

Unified prior samples ~500. Recent period 16 demand=224 is low but regime is noisy; no clear sustained shift. c) Lead time: history shows consistent arrivals one period after ordering (e.g. P2, P4, P6, P8, P9, P11, P13, P16), so infer LT=1. d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=276; in-transit=430 (order from P16) will arrive after decision and before demand, yielding ~706 available for P17 demand. No other overdue/lost orders visible. e) Order logic: holding cost ($1/period) is high relative to profit ($2/unit); avoid excess stock. Projected available (706) comfortably covers expected single-period demand (historical median ~445 but highly variable). Therefore place no new order to minimize holding cost while still meeting near-term demand.",
