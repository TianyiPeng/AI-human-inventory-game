OR recommendation: capped baseline recommends 746 units (uses \u03bc\u0302, \u03c3\u0302 and cap). Decision: follow OR recommendation (order 746). Reasoning: with zero on-hand/pipeline and an estimated period demand ~509, ordering to the OR base-stock is appropriate to achieve the target service level implied by profit/holding tradeoff (q\u22480.667) while respecting the OR cap; reducing the order risks stockouts given current uncertainty and no arrival history.

Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands for SKU: [224,356,735,577,740], mean\u2248526, high variance) so we need safety stock. OR capped baseline recommends 818 units (built from historical \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 and the profit/holding service quantile). Given the confirmed LT=1, zero pipeline, and elevated recent demand I accept the OR recommendation of 818 units: it balances service level (reduces likely stockouts next period) against holding cost given profit=$2 and holding=$1.",
