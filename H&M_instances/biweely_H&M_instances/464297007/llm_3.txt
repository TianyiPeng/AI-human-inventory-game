Lead time & pipeline: history repeatedly confirms LT=1 (many concluded arrivals after single-period orders); no evidence of lost shipments. Current pipeline shows In-transit=540 which will arrive after decision and before demand (so available to meet Period 21 demand). Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 now; after arrivals expected available inventory for demand \u2248540, so likely stockout of ~160 this period. Ordering logic: orders placed now arrive next period (LT=1) so will not affect Period 21 sales but are needed to cover Period 22.
