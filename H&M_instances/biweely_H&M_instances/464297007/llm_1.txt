Forecast & order logic: forecast ~509 units demand next period. Profit per unit $2 vs holding $1/period \u2014 holding cost is substantial, so avoid significant overstock; target fill next-period demand only. Therefore order ~509 units to arrive for Period 2.",

Observed Period 1 demand = 469, consistent with prior mean\u2014no evidence of a sustained shift.\nc) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Period 1 concluded: ordered=509, arrived=0. Per playbook, this does NOT prove a lead-time change (we only observe concluded periods). In-transit=509 likely corresponds to that order, but arrival not yet confirmed; treat LT as unknown/possibly 1 but unconfirmed.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=509 (one outstanding order). Holding cost = $1/unit/period; profit = $2/unit sold. Given large in-transit pipeline near expected demand level, avoid adding inventory now to reduce holding cost and avoid potential overstock.\ne) Final order logic: place no new order this period (0 units). Rationale: pipeline likely sufficient for expected demand, lead-time not yet confirmed so ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost while replenishment from Period 1 may still arrive before next demand period.",

{
  "rationale": "a) Date/context: Period 4 (2019-04-29). No special holiday signal; spring season for apparel but no spike expected. b) Demand regime: historical non-stockout demands ~469,459 (Periods 1\u20132). Period 3 had a stockout (sold=50, demand=345) so true demand likely similar to prior ~460\u2013480. Unified sample mean ~509 but recent realized sales center ~460. I use a conservative forecast of 480 units for a single upcoming period. c) Lead time/missing orders: Concluded history (Period 2) shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 => observed LT = 1. The 410 units shown in-transit were ordered in Period 3 and are expected to arrive in this period (Period 4) before demand, but I cannot see that arrival at decision time. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=410 expected to arrive and will be consumed by Period 4 demand.
