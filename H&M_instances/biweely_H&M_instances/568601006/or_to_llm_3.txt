Decision logic: with ~401 expected demand this period and unreliable pipeline, I will prioritize covering one-period expected demand to avoid a likely stockout. Ordering the full-period mean (401) raises on-hand coverage for imminent demand if the in-transit does not arrive; it modestly increases holding risk if the 509 later arrives, but holding cost ($1/unit) is moderate relative to lost-sales profit ($2/unit). Adjustment vs OR: OR's 329 assumes pipeline is reliable; given the missing arrival, I increase the order to 401 (\u2248 one-period mean) to match expected demand and reduce stockout risk.
