This indicates actual lead time >1 or a delayed shipment; treat the in-transit 802 as unreliable until we see a conclude confirming arrival. Demand & OR math check: historical single-period mean = 401, sample std \u224865.6. Using L=1 gives \u03bc\u0302=802 and \u03c3\u0302\u224892.7. OR's capped base-stock logic yields an order around 36\u201340 units (base_stock\u2212pipeline \u2248 40). Decision & trade-offs: Demand remains high (401 avg), so we cannot safely place zero orders. At the same time, pipeline may still deliver 802 units, which would create heavy holding cost if we over-order. To hedge the delayed shipment risk while avoiding large excess holding, I increase OR's recommendation slightly to 40 units (rounding the computed ~39.8 up). This provides cover if the 802 never arrives or is further delayed, but limits holding cost if it does arrive.
