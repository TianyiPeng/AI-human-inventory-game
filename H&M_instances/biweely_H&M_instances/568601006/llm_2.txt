Demand regime: Periods 11\u201314 show very strong demand (447, 482, 685*, 953*) though Periods 13\u201314 sales were constrained by supply; treat underlying near-term demand as materially above the prior ~275 baseline. Lead time & pipeline: concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 1 period for delivered orders; the current in-transit=450 matches the Period 14 order and is expected to arrive during Period 15 demand resolution (you will see it in Period 16 conclude). Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 now; 450 units will become available during Period 15 demand. Given high recent demand and constrained sells in P13\u2013P14, risk of stockouts is high if we under-order. Economics: profit $2/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is costly but stockouts now would forgo high-margin sales in the near term. Order logic: cannot affect Period 15 arrivals (those are the in-transit 450). Place an order to build pipeline for Period 16 and beyond. Forecast for next period: conservatively expect demand in range ~700 units (given recent spikes and constrained sales). Balance service level with holding cost by ordering enough to cover a high single-period demand while limiting excess.
