Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No arrivals or in-transit inventory visible; promised lead time = 1 and no concluded lead-time observations in history, so use default LT=1. Demand history = [323,393,574,622,535], mean=489.4, std\u2248112.95 (population). Using defaults: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*489.4=978.8 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std=sqrt(2)*112.95\u2248159.75 to reflect demand variability over the (1+L) horizon. These settings give the OR backend a conservative base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost under the promised LT and observed demand volatility.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 showed a promised-LT=1 order (698) with arrived=0 at period conclusion \u2014 no observed arrivals yet, so actual LT appears longer than promised. On-hand=0, pipeline=698 (likely delayed). Historical demand mean = 489.4, std = 126.28 (n=5). To protect service while acknowledging a likely delayed shipment, I increase lead time to 2 periods (explicit). I use full-history defaults for demand over the review+lead period: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean captures expected demand over review+lead; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std captures aggregate uncertainty. These parameters raise safety stock to cover possible late arrivals while letting OR backend cap orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: Observed missing arrival: Period 1 ordered=698 arrived=0 \u2192 treat lead-time as extended (use L\u22482) until an arrival proves otherwise.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows the Period 1 order (698) arrived in Period 2 (lead_time observed = 1). On-hand=55, in-transit=724. No demand changepoint detected in five-sample history (mean=489.4); use default methods. Promised LT=1 is supported by observed arrival, so set L=1. Using defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*489.4 = 978.8, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 1.4142*112.95 = 159.7. These parameters keep the OR backend on a 2-period coverage based on historical mean/volatility while not inflating safety stock for an unreliably long lead time now disproven by arrivals.

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Historical arrivals show P1->P2 and P2->P3 both had lead_time=1 (missing arrival in P1 was later delivered), so no evidence of extended LT now. Use promised LT=1. Demand history (323,393,574,622,535) mean=489.4, std\u2248112.96. With L=1 set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=978.8 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248159.7. This raises the OR base-stock to cover two-period demand variability while the current pipeline=362 and on-hand=0 will be accounted for by the engine when computing the capped order.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows observed lead times of 1 period for all concluded arrivals (orders in P1\u2192arrived P2, P2\u2192P3, P3\u2192P4). On-hand=0 and pipeline=852 (order from Period 4) \u2014 pipeline will arrive with L=1. Demand history mean=489.4 (n=5); no clear demand regime change. I set L to the average observed lead time (1). I use default formulas so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all = sqrt(2)*113.0 = 159.8 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock balanced: service level driven by profit vs holding cost while using observed variability and confirmed LT=1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1704.00

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals (Periods 2\u20135) show consistent observed lead times of 1 period (orders from Periods 1\u20134 all arrived after 1 period). Promised LT=1 and recent evidence contradicts the earlier missing arrival anomaly, so set L=1. Use default demand aggregation: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture full review+lead demand and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to scale volatility for the 2-period window. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical mean demand (mean=489.4) while reflecting observed variability; it avoids overstating safety stock from the single anomalous missing arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time regime confirmed = 1 period based on arrivals in Periods 2\u20135 (orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 each experienced lead_time=1).

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (2\u20138) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=1; use L=1. Demand has increased and been volatile in recent periods (last 5 demands: 728,873,1075,858,533; mean=813.4, sample std\u2248200.56). To capture the recent regime I set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 from the most recent 5 samples and scale for review+lead (1+L=2). This raises target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while \u03c3\u0302 reflects recent volatility so the OR backend's capped ordering balances service vs holding costs.

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (2\u20139) show consistent observed lead times = 1. Use calculated L=1 (average observed). Demand history (periods 1\u20139 demands = [634,643,874,728,873,1075,858,533,450], mean=685.333) shows no clear changepoint; use default scaling for review+lead. Thus set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 2*685.333 = 1370.6667 to cover the two-period review+lead demand. Volatility from all samples: sample std \u2248 205.36, scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives sigma_hat \u2248 290.4. These parameters keep the OR engine\u2019s base-stock tied to recent realized demand while the cap prevents extreme replenishment given current pipeline (on-hand 504, in-transit 795).

Period 11 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=938, in-transit=132. History shows all observed concluded arrivals (Periods 2\u201310) had lead_time=1 after initial missing arrival in Period 1; treat lead time as 1. Use default demand estimators to let OR backend compute base-stock with standard sample stats. Demand sample mean (provided five-sample history) = 489.4; with L=1 this gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 978.8. Sample std \u2248126.2; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 178.6. These settings reflect the confirmed LT=1 regime, keep safety via \u03c3 scaling, and let OR cap limit orders to avoid excess holding given $1 holding vs $2 profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime confirmed = 1 period based on concluded arrivals in Periods 2\u201310 (orders placed in Periods 1\u20139 each experienced lead_time=1).

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (2\u201311) show consistent arrivals with lead_time=1 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201310 arrived in the next period), so use promised LT=1. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean=489.4 and std\u2248126.27; with L=1 I set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=978.8 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248178.6. Current on-hand 848 plus in-transit 326 = 1,174 units of pipeline \u2014 parameters keep base-stock tuned to demand uncertainty while capping orders per OR engine to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2 (service-level q=2/(2+1)=0.6667).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 13). On-hand=876, in-transit=181 (this is the Period 12 order). History shows consistent 1-period actual lead time from Periods 2\u201312; no new missing arrivals in concluded history to overturn that. Use promised lead time L=1. Demand history (given samples) mean=489.4 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=978.8 to cover review+lead demand. Demand std \u2248112.95 -> sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248159.7 to capture variability. These parameters (higher mu relative to immediate on-hand) keep service given current pipeline while the capped-order rule will limit excessive ordering to control holding cost (profit/hold = 2.0/1.0 implies moderate service quantile).

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (2\u201313) consistently show lead time = 1 after the initial Period 1 missing arrival; treat L=1. Recent demand has declined versus early peaks; last coherent regime is Periods 9\u201313 demands = [450,361,222,298,286] (mean=323.4, std\u224886.3). On-hand=771 + in-transit=264 provides ample pipeline but demand over review+lead (1+L) should use recent regime to avoid overstock. I set L=1 (confirmed), mu_hat using last 5 periods to capture the lower recent mean, and sigma_hat from the same 5-period sample scaled by sqrt(1+L) to reflect review+lead variability. These parameters raise service for recent demand while avoiding excess holdings given holding cost = $1 and profit = $2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-189.00

Period 15 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised LT=1 is confirmed by concluded arrivals in Periods 2\u201314 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201313 each experienced lead_time=1). On-hand=753, in-transit=0 so we carry ample inventory vs recent demand samples. Use default methods to let OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample stats: mean of available demand samples=489.4 \u2192 (1+L)*mean=978.8. Volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L): std(samples)\u2248112.95 \u2192 sigma_hat=112.95*\u221a2\u2248159.8. These settings keep service high (profit/holding q = 2/(2+1)=0.666) while capping orders via OR's cap rule; they also reflect confirmed LT=1 and recent high on-hand, avoiding unnecessary replenishment.

Period 16 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new news-driven demand shift. Recent history (Periods 2\u201314) consistently shows observed lead time = 1. One missing arrival in Period 15 conclusion does not prove a regime change (could be sequencing), so use promised LT=1. Use default estimators to let OR backend apply its service-level math: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances current moderate mean demand (~489.4) against volatility (std ~126.29) while relying on the capped-order safeguard.

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows a stable 1-period lead time from Periods 2\u201316 (arrivals consistently match orders placed one period earlier after the initial Period 1 anomaly). On-hand = 877 and in-transit = 159; no new missing arrivals in concluded periods to suggest extended LT. I use L=1 (promised, confirmed by many concluded arrivals). Demand history (use provided samples) mean = 489.4; with review+lead = (1+L)*mean \u2192 mu_hat = 978.8. Volatility: sample std = 126.27, scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 sigma_hat = 178.6. These default choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock around the historical mean demand over review+lead while reflecting observed variability; they avoid overreacting to the isolated Period 1 missed arrival.

Period 18 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (2\u201317) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=1 (the early Period 1 missing arrival is an outlier). I therefore set L=1 (calculated average). Demand history provided (samples [323,393,574,622,535], mean=489.4, std\u2248126.26) is used with the default OR formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean=978.8 to cover review+lead demand, sigma_hat=\u221a(1+L)\xd7std\u2248178.5 to reflect observed volatility over the combined period. These settings keep the base-stock anchored to historical demand while the capped-order logic will limit order size, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=$2 and Holding=$1.

Period 19 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 19). History shows a stable 1-period lead-time regime from Periods 2\u201318 (the one early missing arrival was an outlier and subsequent arrivals confirm LT=1). Current on-hand=924, in-transit=108 (expected arrival but not visible at decision time). I use L=promised (1) to match the long run observed regime. Demand samples provided (323,393,574,622,535) give mean=489.4; using default (1+L)*mean -> mu_hat=978.8. Volatility: population std of samples \u2248112.95, scaled by sqrt(1+L) gives sigma_hat\u2248159.7. These defaults reflect the long-run demand statistics and keep safety stock calibrated to the observed variability while trusting the confirmed LT=1 to avoid overcorrecting for the single early missing arrival.

Period 20 (2019-12-09) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 20). History shows stable 1-period arrivals from Periods 2\u201319 (initial Period 1 was a missing arrival anomaly). On-hand=862, in-transit=107 (no outstanding unexplained delays). I use promised lead time L=1 (confirmed by long run of arrivals) and set demand parameters from the provided historical demand samples [323,393,574,622,535]. Using defaults (1+L) scaling keeps the OR engine's base-stock centered on observed mean while the sqrt(1+L) scaling captures lead-time aggregation of variability. This gives mu_hat = (1+1)*mean = 978.8 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+1)*std = 178.6, which biases toward service (profit > holding cost) but keeps cap limiting large orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time regime confirmed = 1 period based on concluded arrivals in Periods 2\u201319 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201318 each experienced lead_time=1).

On-hand=850, in-transit=145 (pipeline already reflects last orders). I use promised/default lead time L=1. Demand prior samples (seeded) have mean=489.4 and std\u2248112.93; using default aggregation (1+L) scaling yields mu_hat=978.8 and sigma_hat\u2248159.7. These parameters give the OR backend a base-stock tuned to recent long-run mean demand while the capped order cap will limit excessive replenishment given holding cost=1 and profit=2.
