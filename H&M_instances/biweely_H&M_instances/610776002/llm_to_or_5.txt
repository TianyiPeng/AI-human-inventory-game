Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No arrivals or pipeline; on-hand=0. Promised lead time is 1 and there is no concluded arrival history to contradict it. Historical demand samples = [323,393,574,622,535] (mean=489.4, sample std\u2248126.27). Recent periods show higher demand vs earliest sample but no clear regime change; use defaults so OR backend leverages full history. Using L=1 (promised) gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*126.27 \u2248 178.57. These parameters raise target stock for two-period coverage while reflecting observed volatility and keeping safety via the OR cap.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (order placed in Period 1 not yet concluded in history). Promised LT=1 and no concluded period explicitly showing observed lead times, so do not infer a LT change from missing arrivals (sequencing prevents seeing Period 2 arrivals). Demand history=[323,393,574,622,535]; no clear recent changepoint. Use default methods to let OR backend compute base-stock while accounting for 1-period LT. This balances service (use full sample mean) vs holding cost conservatively given one outstanding in-transit order.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 decision (2019-04-15): on-hand=55, in-transit=407 (order placed Period 2). Historical concluded lead times: one observed LT=1 (Period 1\u21922). Demand history (5 samples) mean=489.4, sample std\u2248126.27. No evidence of changepoint or lost shipments. Use promised LT=1 as actual (average of observed). Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*126.27 = 178.6 to reflect demand variability over review+lead. These parameters give the OR engine a base-stock balancing profit ($2) vs holding ($1) with current pipeline accounted for (pipeline=on-hand+in-transit=462).

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision (2019-04-29). History shows two concluded arrivals with lead_time=1 (Period2: order from P1 arrived after 1; Period3: order from P2 arrived after 1) \u2014 no evidence of LT drift, so use promised/default LT=1. Demand history (samples provided) has mean=489.4 and no clear changepoint; I'll use the full-sample defaults: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = sqrt(2)*126.27 \u2248 178.6 to reflect observed volatility. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=679 (this is pipeline inventory; arrivals will occur after this decision). These parameters give the OR engine a base-stock that balances profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1) while the sigma preserves service-level safety for variability.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision (2019-05-13). History shows three concluded arrivals with lead_time=1 (Period2 arrived order from P1; P3 from P2; P4 from P3) \u2192 no evidence of LT drift, so use L=1. On-hand=0, in-transit=573 (ordered in Period 4) \u2014 this is pipeline inventory that will affect orders but is not visible before decision. Demand history (all samples) mean=489.4, std=126.27. Using default methods with L=1: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 178.6 to capture increased variability over the review+lead window. These parameters keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to observed demand while the cap limits order size; maintaining L=1 avoids overreacting to a single missing arrival (none observed).

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 6). History shows consistent observed lead times of 1 period (arrivals in Periods 2\u20135 each had lead_time=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=712 (the order placed in Period 5) \u2014 per sequencing this arrival is not visible in decision history yet but prior concluded periods confirm LT=1. Demand history (5 samples) mean=489.4, sample std\u2248112.96. No clear changepoint in demand; use full-sample estimates and promised lead time. Using L=1 keeps pipeline expectations aligned with observed arrivals; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean captures demand over review+lead period; sigma_hat=\u221a(1+L)*std scales variability over the review+lead horizon and provides safety buffer for the OR capped policy.

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand has stepped up starting Period 3 (demands: Period3-6 = 874, 728, 873, 1075) vs earlier Period1-2 (634,643). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 1 (Periods 2-6 arrivals trace to orders placed one period earlier). I treat this as a sustained upward regime beginning Period 3 and use recent_N for demand (N=4, Periods 3-6) while keeping promised lead time. This raises base-stock inputs so OR increases safety stock to avoid stockouts given higher recent mean and remaining pipeline (638 units in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Demand upshift starting Period 3: recent mean (Periods 3-6) = 887.5 units per period; treat as new regime until contradicted. Lead time stable at 1 (observed in Periods 2-6).

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history shows a sustained demand upshift starting Period 3 (Periods 3-7 mean \u2248881.6) and observed lead-times=1 in concluded periods. On\u2010hand=0, in\u2010transit=1123 (matches last order). I keep L at the promised lead time=1 (stable evidence). I set demand forecast over the review+lead horizon using the recent regime (Periods 3\u20137, N=5) to capture the higher mean; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last 5 demands)=2*881.6=1763.2. I estimate volatility from the same 5-sample regime (sample std \u2248124.09; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std\u2248175.56) so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to service the new demand regime while the capped order prevents excessive single-period ordering given holding cost.

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows stable observed lead time=1 (arrivals in Periods 2-8 all matched orders placed one period earlier). Demand regime upshift starting Period 3 (carry-over) with recent regime sample Periods 3-6 mean=887.5; Periods 7-8 show some variability but not yet strong evidence to abandon the upshift. I use promised LT (default L=1). For demand I use recent_N (N=4, Periods 3-6) to capture the upshift: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent4)=2*887.5=1775.0. For volatility I use recent_N (same N=4) scaled by sqrt(1+L): sample std of Periods 3-6 \u2248142.63, sigma_hat = sqrt(2)*142.63 \u2248201.74. These parameters raise the base-stock to reflect the sustained higher demand while using recent variability to avoid overstock from the single low recent observation (Period 8).

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No new news. History shows lead time stable at 1 (observed repeatedly Periods 2\u20139). Carry-over insight identified a demand upshift starting Period 3; recent regime (Periods 3\u20139) has mean demand ~770.14 and elevated volatility. I keep L as promised=1. For mu_hat I use recent_N to capture the upshift regime (N=7, Periods 3\u20139): mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 770.142857 = 1540.285714. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (same N=7) to reflect higher observed variability: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent \u2248 307.24. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the higher demand regime while the inflated sigma increases safety stock for observed variability; using recent data avoids diluting the upshift with earlier low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-274.00

Period 11 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent history: lead time has been observed as 1 in concluded periods (Periods 2-10). Demand showed an upshift in Periods 3-6 (mean 887.5) but declined after Period 6; the most recent regime (Periods 8-10) has lower demand (mean 448). On-hand=996, in-transit=316; promised LT=1 and no overdue/lost arrivals in concluded history. I set L to the promised lead time (stable in history). For demand I use a recent_N estimate using the most recent stable regime (Periods 8-10, N=3) because the apparent upshift was contradicted by later low demand \u2014 this gives a conservative forecast that reflects the recent downshift. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 448 = 896. sigma_hat uses recent_N (Periods 8-10) with sqrt(1+L) scaling: std([533,450,361]) \u2248 70.2 -> sigma_hat \u2248 70.2 * sqrt(2) \u2248 99.3. These parameters reduce target base-stock relative to the earlier high-demand estimate and limit excess holding given holding cost = $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime reversed after Period 6: recent mean (Periods 8-10)=448 units; lead time remains stable at 1 (Periods 2-10).

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 12). Recent demand has fallen since Period 7; periods 8-11 = [533,450,361,222] show a lower regime. Lead time has been observed as 1 in concluded periods 2-10 and no evidence of change in Period 11, so use promised LT=1. I set mu_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 8-11, N=4) to reflect the sustained lower mean (mean=391.5) => mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*391.5=783.0. I set sigma_hat from the same recent sample (std of [533,450,361,222]=~115.34, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 => sigma_hat\u2248163.10) to capture reduced variability. These parameters lower target base stock to avoid excess holding given current weak demand while keeping safety stock for LT uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lowered starting Period 8: recent mean (Periods 8-11)=391.5 units/period; lead time stable at 1 (observed Periods 2-10).

Period 13 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-02. On-hand=792, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show stable observed lead time = 1 (periods 1\u201310); no evidence of persistent LT shift. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8 (Periods 8\u201312 recent demands = [533,450,361,222,298], mean=372.8). I set L to the promised lead time=1. I set mu_hat using a recent_N forecast (last 5 periods in the current low regime) so the OR base-stock targets the current lower demand level: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*372.8 = 745.6. I set sigma_hat from the sample volatility in the same recent window, scaled by sqrt(1+L) to reflect review+lead variability: sample std \u2248122.56 \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248122.56*sqrt(2)=173.4. These parameters reduce overstocks versus older high-demand data while keeping safety stock for variability and one-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lowered starting Period 8; recent mean (Periods 8-12)=372.8 units/period; lead time remains stable at 1 (observed Periods 1-10).

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 14). Current on-hand 506, in-transit 29 \u2192 pipeline=535. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time observed =1 in Periods 2\u201310; a 29-unit order placed in Period 13 is in-transit (arrived=0 in Period 13) so missing by 1 period only \u2014 not enough to declare LT shift. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 8; last 6 periods (8\u201313) demands = [533,450,361,222,298,286], mean=358.33, std\u2248115.2. I set L to the promised lead time (1). I set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=6) \u2192 (1+L)*mean = 2*358.33 = 716.67 to reflect current lower demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) \u2192 sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*115.2 \u2248 162.90 to capture observed volatility. These parameters reduce target stock relative to earlier high-demand regime while keeping safety for variability and possible 1-period arrival uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lowered starting Period 8; recent mean (Periods 8\u201313)=358.33 units/period (std\u2248115.2). Lead time historically stable at 1 (observed Periods 2\u201310); one in-transit order (29 units) missing by 1 period in Period 13 but not yet evidence of LT shift.

Period 16 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods (8\u201315) show a sustained lower demand regime vs earlier periods. Demands (P8\u2013P15) = [533,450,361,222,298,286,282,191], mean=327.875, std\u2248115.18. Lead time observed consistently =1 in concluded periods (Period 2\u219215 arrivals match orders with LT=1). I set L=default (promised=1). I use recent_N (N=8, regime from Period 8 onward) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime while keeping safety stock for observed volatility. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*327.875 = 655.75. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*115.18 \u2248 162.90.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lowered starting Period 8; recent mean (Periods 8\u201315)=327.9 units/period, std\u2248115.2; lead time stable at 1 (observed Periods 2\u201315).

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has remained in the lowered regime that started Period 8. I use recent data (Periods 8\u201316) to capture the current mean and volatility (no new evidence of LT drift; historical concluded arrivals show LT=1 consistently). Therefore: L use promised lead time=1. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean(demand Periods 8\u201316) to size the review+lead forecast to the recent regime. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std(demand Periods 8\u201316) to reflect realized variability in the same window. These choices keep service targeted to the lowered demand regime while the OR engine applies the capped ordering constraint.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lowered starting Period 8; recent mean (Periods 8\u201316)=312.89 units/period, std\u2248116.74; lead time stable at 1 (observed Periods 2\u201316).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-116.00

Period 18 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 8; last 10 concluded periods (8\u201317) average demand=295.5 units (std\u2248122.99). Lead time observed stable at 1 in history (multiple concluded arrivals with LT=1, no multi-period misses requiring LT change). To reflect the recent lower regime I use recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters and keep L=default (promised LT=1). This gives mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean to target the two-period review+lead demand and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to capture observed volatility; these raise safety stock modestly while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lowered starting Period 8; recent mean (Periods 8\u201317)=295.5 units/period, std\u2248122.99. Lead time stable at 1 (observed Periods 2\u201317).

Lead time has been observed stable at 1 in concluded periods (Periods 2\u201317). To respect the recent regime I set L to the promised 1. I use recent_N=10 (Periods 8\u201317) for demand: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 295.5 = 591.0 to size protection across review+lead, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2)*122.99 \u2248 173.91 to capture volatility. These parameters keep safety stock aligned to the lower-demand regime while preserving service with observed LT=1; they avoid inflating inventory after the sustained downshift.

Period 20 (2019-12-09) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 1 in concluded history; recent demand regime lowered starting Period 8.

Period 21 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 21). Historical concluded periods show lead time stable at 1 (many observed arrivals with LT=1 through Period 20). Demand has stayed in the lower regime since Period 8; I use the most recent regime (Periods 8\u201320, N=13) to forecast. Computed recent mean demand over review+lead (1+L)=2 => mean demand per period over Periods 8\u201320 = 260.0, so mu_hat = 2 * 260.0 = 520.0. Sample std of Periods 8\u201320 demands \u2248 126.56; scale by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 to get sigma_hat \u2248 179.0. Using L=1 (default promised LT=1) and recent_N estimates anchors the OR backend to the current lowered-demand regime and keeps safety stock aligned with observed volatility while capping orders via the OR engine.
