  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-09: no seasonal event apparent for this SKU; recent realized demand has declined from summer peaks to roughly 140\u2013200 units/period (Periods 16\u201319 avg \u2248160) vs earlier mid-200s. Lead time still believed to be 1 period (confirmed many concluded periods). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=340 (likely arrival next period). OR baseline (774) assumes high historical mean and 1-period LT; it would cause large overstock given recent downshift and a large in-transit shipment. I therefore scale the OR recommendation sharply down. Target for one-period exposure: expected demand \u2248160\xd7(1+L)=\u2248320 plus a modest safety buffer (~50) => target pipeline \u2248370. With 340 already in-transit, I order the difference \u224830\u201340. I choose 50 to give a small extra cushion against variability but avoid heavy holding cost (Profit=$2, Holding=$1 \u2192 moderate service level). This balances service vs holding cost and corrects OR's high stock suggestion given demand drop and sizable pipeline.",

Current stock: on-hand=221, in-transit=50 \u2192 pipeline=271. OR capped recommendation (817) assumes higher historic mean and LT; it greatly overshoots given recent downshift.
