No in-period history yet to indicate a shift. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Supplier promised LT=1, but no concluded arrival evidence exists yet. Do NOT assume any arrivals this period; assume LT=1 for planning unless/until history shows otherwise. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue orders. e) Final order logic: Since any order placed now cannot satisfy Period 1 demand, target next-period expected demand. Balance service level vs. high holding cost ($1 per unit per period which is 50% of profit $2): order close to historical mean to avoid heavy leftover stock while capturing most sales. Place an order of 490 units (rounding mean \u2248489).",

Lead time & pipeline: history through Period 13 confirms LT=1 (arrivals one period after ordering); Period 14 shows ordered=87 and arrived=0 in its conclude, so 87 units are in-transit and expected to arrive this period (before demand). Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=87 (expected to become available for Period 15 demand). Forecast: expect ~320 units demand this period. Ordering logic: orders placed now arrive next period (LT=1) and will not help Period 15 demand; to meet next-period demand (~320) while avoiding excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($2/unit), place an order to cover the forecast next-period demand.
