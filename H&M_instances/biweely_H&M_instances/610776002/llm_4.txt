No recent concluded periods to indicate a regime change. c) Lead time: supplier promised LT=1 but no concluded arrivals exist yet; treat LT as 1 for planning but be conservative until confirmed. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, nothing overdue. e) Order logic: target expected demand \u2248489. Given holding cost = $1/unit/period (high relative to profit $2/unit), avoid material overstock; order close to mean forecast.

Period 1 observed demand=634, suggesting recent demand may be above the long-run mean but this is a single high observation. I use a conservative blended forecast \u2248560 units for Period 2. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: History (Period 1 conclude) shows ordered=490 arrived=0; no concluded arrival evidence of a 1-period lead time yet. Treat the in-transit 490 as uncertain (may be delayed or lost). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=490 (uncertain). If the 490 arrives, it will cover most demand; if not, there will be a shortfall. Holding cost is high ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($2/unit), so avoid large excess inventory. e) Final order logic: Hedge against the risk that the 490 does not arrive by ordering a partial replenishment to cover likely shortfall while limiting holding cost. Forecast ~560 minus 490 available = ~70 shortfall if transit arrives; if transit doesn't arrive, shortfall ~560. I choose a moderate order of 300 units to balance service and holding costs.",

In-transit=280 (order placed in Period 14) is expected to arrive this period but is not visible to me when deciding; however it is in the pipeline and will supply demand. No overdue/lost orders evident. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=280 (will be available for Period 15 demand). Forecasted Period 15 demand \u2248290. The pipeline (280) slightly under-covers expected demand by ~10 units. e) Final order logic: Orders placed now (Period 15) will arrive in Period 16 (LT=1). Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($2/unit sold), keep safety stock minimal. Forecast for Period 16 \u2248290; order enough to meet one-period expected demand with a small buffer.
