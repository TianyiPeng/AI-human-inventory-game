{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-09. History shows supplier lead time = 1 (every concluded order in P2\u2013P19 arrived after one period). On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (this is the order placed in Period 19 and, per LT=1 evidence, will arrive this period after I decide but before demand). Recent realized demand has been low: Periods 16\u201319 demands = 193,139,136,170 (mean \u2248159). OR recommends 919 (uses long-run historical mean and promised LT) \u2014 I treat that as a starting point but it is far above recent regime. With Profit=$2 and Holding=$1, the service quantile is moderate (z\u22480.43). Given LT=1, expected period demand \u2248160; pipeline 120 will cover most of that. I therefore order conservatively to avoid costly holding: order = 60 units so that arrival + in-transit \u2248180 which gives ~1.1\xd7 expected demand with a small safety buffer. This minimizes overstock while preserving service given low recent demand and confirmed LT=1.",

Period 21 (2019-12-23) Hybrid Decision:
============================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23. Recent concluded periods show a sustained lower demand regime (~150\u2013160 units/period over P16\u2013P20) and supplier lead time = 1 (consistent single-period arrivals). Current visible inventory is on-hand=1 and in-transit=60 (pipeline\u224861). OR's capped recommendation (911) is driven by older high-demand history and the promised LT; it overstates need given the clear downward demand shift and high relative holding cost. With LT=1, target service stock \u2248 expected demand + small safety factor: ~160 + 0.43\xb7(\u224830) \u2248172 units. Net order = target \u2212 pipeline \u2248172 \u2212 61 \u2248111. I round to 110 to avoid overstocking given Holding=$1/unit/period and Profit=$2/unit. This balances service-level goals against holding cost while respecting observed lower demand and reliable LT=1.",
