Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
No arrivals/pipeline and no news; use promised lead time. Historical demand mean=489.4 (n=5). No clear changepoint. Set L to promised 1 so review+lead =2 periods. Use default formulas: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean =2*489.4=978.8 to cover expected demand over review+lead. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). Sample std\u2248112.94 \u2192 sigma_hat\u2248112.94*\u221a2=159.72. These settings give the OR backend a base-stock tuned to historical mean/variance while keeping safety buffer for observed variability.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision sees on-hand=0 and in-transit=698 but Period 1 concluded with ordered=698 arrived=0 (no observed lead-time history). Promised lead time=1; no concluded arrivals with explicit lead times exist to justify changing L, so keep L=promised (1). Demand history (5 samples: mean=489.4, std\u2248112.96) shows no clear recent changepoint; use defaults so OR backend uses full-sample estimates. Thus set L=1 (default), mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all=2*489.4=978.8, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all=\u221a2*112.96\u2248159.6. This keeps base-stock driven by historical demand while acknowledging the missing arrival in Period 1 (monitor next conclude to detect LT drift or lost shipment).

Carry-over insight: In-transit 698 ordered previously did not arrive in Period 1 (Period 1 conclude: arrived=0); treat as potential delay/loss and monitor next concluded period for lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 3). History: one observed lead time = 1 (Period1 order arrived in Period2). Promised LT=1; no sustained lead-time drift visible. Demand history [323,393,574,622,535], mean=489.4, std(pop)=112.95. I set L=1 (average observed). Use default demand/volatility scaling for review+lead period: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover two-period demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*112.95 = 159.7 to reflect accumulated variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to target service given Profit/(Profit+Holding)=2/(2+1)=0.666..., while the capped order limit (handled by OR) will prevent extreme replenishment if pipeline already large.

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show observed lead times = 1 (Period 2: ordered P1 arrived in 1; Period 3: ordered P2 arrived in 1). The Period 1 missing arrival was subsequently delivered in Period 2, so no persistent LT shift detected. Demand history [323,393,574,622,535] has mean=489.4 and population std\u2248112.94. With promised LT=1, use L=1. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*112.94 \u2248 159.78 to reflect demand uncertainty over review+lead. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock near the observed demand level while the sigma increases safety for variability; q = 2/(2+1)=0.6667 implies moderate service-level uplift.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 5). History shows observed lead times of 1 period for orders concluded in Periods 2,3,4 (orders placed in P1,P2,P3 arrived after 1 period); the earlier missing arrival from Period 1 was resolved in Period 2. Demand sample set = [323,393,574,622,535] (mean=489.4, std\u2248126.26). Promised LT=1 and recent concluded evidence supports LT=1. I choose L as the average observed lead time (1). Use default aggregation for demand across review+lead: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to capture full review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all) = sqrt(2)*126.26 \u2248 178.58 to reflect observed variability. These parameters keep the OR backend base-stock tied to recent demand central tendency while preserving safety from the measured volatility; they also avoid overreacting to the one-period missing arrival that has been reconciled.

Carry-over insight: Lead time now appears stable at 1 period (observed lead times: 1,1,1 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 arriving in Periods 2-4); treat LT=1 going forward unless future concluded periods show further delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time now appears stable at 1 period (observed lead times: 1,1,1 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 arriving in Periods 2-4); treat LT=1 going forward unless future concluded periods show further delays.

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision (2019-05-27): historical concluded arrivals show stable lead time = 1 (observed lead times = 1,1,1 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 arriving in Periods 2-4; Period 5 conclusion continued that pattern). On-hand=0, in-transit=712 (expected pipeline). No clear demand regime shift in the 5-sample history. Use promised LT=1 and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock while keeping service against holding cost tradeoff.

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 7). History shows stable observed lead times = 1 (orders placed in Periods 1-5 arrived in next concluded period), so use promised LT=1. Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-6) = [634,643,874,728,873,1075]; mean=804.5. Using default formulas: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*804.5 = 1609.0. Sample std of demands \u2248169.56; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 1.4142*169.56 = 239.8. These parameters increase target base stock to cover high recent demand and variability while L=1 keeps pipeline short; no new evidence of lost shipments so no increase to L or explicit safety beyond default variance scaling. On-hand is 0 with 638 in-transit (order placed in Period 6) \u2014 decision uses L=1 and these demand stats.

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 8). History shows stable observed lead times = 1 for recent concluded periods (Periods 2-7). Recent demand has risen and is higher/volatile vs earlier samples (Periods 3-7 demands = [874,728,873,1075,858], mean\u2248881.6, sd\u2248124.1). On-hand=0, in-transit=818 (expected pipeline). I keep L at the promised/stable value of 1. To capture the recent elevated demand regime I use recent_N=5 (Periods 3-7) for demand estimates so mu_hat covers the review+lead period (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat scales sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). This raises the base-stock to service higher demand while sigma_hat increases safety stock for variability; keeping L=1 avoids overreacting to isolated missing arrivals.

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-08. Historical concluded arrivals show stable observed lead time = 1 (orders in Periods 1-7 arrived after 1 period); treat promised LT=1 as reliable. On-hand=285 + in-transit=1021 => pipeline=1306, which exceeds the (1+L)-period demand forecast. I use default methods: L set to promised LT=1 (matches observed history); mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect long-run demand (no clear recent demand regime change); sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture observed volatility. These parameters keep base-stock driven by overall demand signal while the OR backend cap will limit excessive ordering given current large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show observed lead times = 1 repeatedly (Periods 2-9 arrivals), so set L=1. Use default demand aggregation: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all concluded demands). Mean demand over Periods 1-9 = 741 -> mu_hat = 2*741 = 1482.0. Compute sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)*std(all concluded demands). Sample std \u2248 185.447 -> sigma_hat \u2248 1.4142*185.447 = 262.3. These parameters keep base-stock targeting recent realized demand over the review+lead window and the cap limits extreme ordering while holding cost ($1) vs profit ($2) trade-off is encoded in OR backend.

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History of concluded periods shows consistent observed lead times of 1 (recent observed LT=1 for orders placed in Periods 1\u201310); no new delays observed in concluded history. Use promised LT=1. Demand samples provided (323,393,574,622,535) have mean=489.4 and std\u2248112.95. Using default formulas with L=1: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248159.7 to reflect variability over the review+lead window. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with observed demand while the capped order limit will control order size to mitigate excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$2.

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent concluded lead times of 1 period from Periods 2\u201313 (orders placed in Period N arriving in Period N+1). On-hand=771 and in-transit=264; promised LT=1 is still supported by concluded arrivals. I use default (promised) lead time L=1. I set mu_hat using default (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the long-run sample mean (samples provided), giving mu_hat=978.8 (units over review+lead). I set sigma_hat using default sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed volatility, giving sigma_hat\u2248178.6. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to observed demand while accounting for two-period review+lead coverage and measured demand variability; they balance the profit vs. holding cost signal (profit=$2, holding=$1) through the backend's service-level calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable at 1 period (observed lead times = 1 for orders placed in Periods 1\u201312 arriving in Periods 2\u201313); treat LT=1 unless future concluded periods show delays.

Period 15 (2019-09-30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-09-30). History shows consistent observed lead time = 1 in concluded periods 2\u201314 (orders arriving one period after placement). On-hand=753, in-transit=255; no new missing arrivals in concluded history to suggest LT drift. Use promised LT=1. Demand seed provided (samples [323,393,574,622,535]) \u2014 no strong recent changepoint signalled; use default whole-sample estimates scaled for review+lead (1+L). This yields mu_hat = 2 * mean(samples) = 978.8 and sigma_hat = sqrt(2) * std(samples) = 178.5. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to observed demand while LT=1 and provide moderate safety stock for observed volatility, balancing the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Concluded history shows consistent observed lead times =1 for orders placed in Periods 1\u201314 arriving in Periods 2\u201315 -> treat LT stable at 1. No new missing arrivals to signal delay. I use default statistical methods: L=promised lead time (1) because concluded periods consistently show LT=1. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 2*489.4 = 978.8, capturing demand over review+lead period. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) = sqrt(2)*126.28 = 178.6 to reflect observed variability scaled for L=1. These parameters give the OR backend a base stock that balances a higher service target (profit > holding) while accounting for observed demand volatility and the stable 1-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history shows no recent regime shift vs provided sample set; using default estimators keeps OR backend calibrated to long-run demand. I set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture expected demand over review+lead, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect variability over that horizon. These parameters give the backend a base-stock that balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost (service level q = 2/(2+1)=0.666...), while the capped order logic limits order size to avoid excess inventory given already-high on-hand (924) and 108 in-transit.
