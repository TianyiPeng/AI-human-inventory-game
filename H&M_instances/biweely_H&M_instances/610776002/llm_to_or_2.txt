Period 1 (2019-03-18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. No concluded periods showing arrivals or observed lead times in history, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Demand history (5 samples) shows mean 489.4 and moderate variance; no clear changepoint or seasonality signal in provided data. Use promised lead time (1) as default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults ((1+L) scaling) so the OR backend computes a base-stock from the full-sample demand mean and variance; this balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019-04-01) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=698 (order placed in Period 1) but Period 1 concluded arrival=0 \u2014 per sequencing, a missing arrival in the concluded period is not proof of a changed lead time today, so use promised LT. Use promised L=1. Demand history = [323,393,574,622,535,634] (includes Period 1 demand=634). Mean demand = 513.5; with review+lead (1+L)=2 \u2192 mu_hat = 1027.0. Sample std \u2248116.337; scale by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248164.6. These default choices keep the OR engine's base-stock anchored to recent realized demand while not overreacting to the single missed arrival; safety cap still limits order size vs. pipeline (in-transit=698) to balance service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) and holding costs.

Period 3 (2019-04-15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 decision (2019-04-15). History shows one observed lead time = 1 (Period 2 conclude: arrival=698 ordered on Period 1, lead_time=1). Current inventory: on-hand=55, in-transit=407 (expected arrival from Period 2 but arrivals occur after decision). Demand history (samples) = [323,393,574,622,535], mean=489.4, std\u2248112.96. I set L=1 (average of observed lead times). Using default formulas: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*112.96 \u2248159.75 to reflect demand variability over the combined period. These parameters keep the OR engine's base-stock high enough to protect service (profit>holding cost implies moderate service target) while using observed lead-time stability to avoid extra safety stock for LT uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time = 1 (Period 2 conclude: 698 units arrived that were ordered on Period 1), treat LT as stable until contradicted.

Period 4 (2019-04-29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=679. Historical concluded lead times observed =1 (Periods 2\u20133). Recent arrivals match promised LT=1, so treat LT as stable. Demand history (samples=[323,393,574,622,535]) shows no clear changepoint; use default population-based estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock while accounting for 1-period lead. Defaults: L=promised=1, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)=2*489.4=978.8 to cover expected demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=sqrt(2)*112.95\u2248159.7 to reflect observed volatility. These conservative defaults maintain service given in-transit stock while avoiding overreaction to the single large demand spike in Period 3.

Period 5 (2019-05-13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=573. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time=1 in Periods 2\u20134 (stable). Use promised LT=1. Demand history mean=489.4 over 5 samples; set mu_hat=(1+L)*mean = 2*489.4 = 978.8 to cover review+lead period. Volatility: sample std \u2248112.94 scaled by sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 => sigma_hat \u2248159.6. These settings keep L conservative (matches observed arrivals), raise target base-stock to cover two-period demand, and reflect observed demand variability so the OR backend balances the $2 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 6 (2019-05-27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent observed lead time = 1 (arrivals in Periods 2\u20135 were all from orders placed one period earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=712 (matches Period 5 ordered=712 arriving next). I therefore keep L at the promised 1. I use default demand estimators using all five historical demands: mean=489.4 \u2192 mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=978.8 to cover the two-period review+lead window; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)=~159.79 to reflect observed variability. These parameters raise base-stock to meet high recent demand while the OR backend cap will limit order size, balancing service level (profit $2 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1424.00

Period 7 (2019-06-10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show a sustained demand increase since Period 2 (demands in Periods 2-6 = [643,874,728,873,1075], mean=838.6, std=147.5). Promised lead time has been observed stable at 1 in concluded history. I use L=promised (1). To reflect the higher recent demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 concluded demands (N=5) and scale for review+lead (1+L). This raises the base-stock target to better cover elevated demand while sigma_hat captures the higher volatility observed, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased starting Period 2; recent-5 mean=838.6 (Periods 2-6) vs earlier lower baseline\u2014use elevated forecast and volatility.

Period 8 (2019-06-24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded periods show stable observed lead times =1 (periods 2\u20137). Demand jumped starting period 2; most recent 5-period regime (Periods 3\u20137 demands = [874,728,873,1075,858], mean=881.6, sample std\u2248124.08) is the best predictor of current elevated demand. Use L=1 (calculated from observed lead times) and recent-5 demand to capture the new higher mean and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock toward current demand while capping orders via its cap formula.

Period 9 (2019-07-08) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 decision: on-hand=577, in-transit=729. Historical concluded arrivals show stable lead time=1 (Periods 2\u20138 all show lead_time=1). Demand has been in an elevated regime since Period 2; using recent-5 (most recent 5 periods' demands: Periods 4\u20138 = [728,873,1075,858,533]) to capture current mean/volatility. Set L to promised=1. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent5 = 2 * 813.4 = 1626.8 to target service under higher demand. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent5 = 1.4142 * 199.3 = 281.8 to reflect observed volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to satisfy higher demand while OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula.

Period 10 (2019-07-22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. History shows stable promised lead time=1 (observed LT=1 repeatedly) and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 2. I use L=1 (promised) and base forecasts on the recent regime (Periods 2\u20139). Recent-8 mean demand over review+lead gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent8 = 2*754.25 = 1508.5 units, capturing the elevated demand but using 8 samples (regime length=8). Volatility uses recent-8 std scaled by sqrt(1+L): sample std \u2248205.9 -> sigma_hat \u2248205.9*sqrt(2)=291.3. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service under the higher-demand regime while keeping sigma-driven cap to limit extreme overordering given holding cost.

Period 11 (2019-08-05) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. History shows consistent observed lead times =1 in concluded periods (Periods 2\u201310 arrivals all indicate LT=1). Demand peaked in Periods 2\u20136 then softened from Period 8 onward. Recent 5-period demand (Periods 6\u201310 = [1075,858,533,450,361]) has mean 655.4 and elevated variability. I set L to the promised/stable value 1. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the downward shift since the peak while still reflecting remaining volatility. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 655.4 = 1310.8 to size the base stock for the 1\u2010period lead + review. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5): sample std \u2248 268.7 scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2192 \u2248380.0 to reflect current demand volatility. These parameters reduce overstating demand from the earlier peak while keeping safety stock for variability and the 1\u2010period lead time, balancing service (profit $2 vs holding $1) with lower holding cost exposure given large on\u2010hand + in\u2010transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable =1 observed in concluded periods 2\u201310 (arrivals match ordered previous period); Demand: earlier high regime (Periods 2\u20136) has softened since Period 8 \u2014 recent 5-period mean=655.4, use recent window.

Period 12 (2019-08-19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
History shows consistent observed lead time = 1 in concluded periods 2\u201311 (arrivals always match prior-period orders). Recent demand has softened since Period 8; last 5 demands (Periods 7\u201311 = [858,533,450,361,222]) have mean 484.8 and elevated dispersion. I set L to the observed-average (1). I use a recent-5 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the softer recent regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 2*484.8 = 969.6. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std_recent; sample std of the 5 demands \u2248 238.0, so sigma_hat \u2248 336.8. These parameters down-weight the earlier high regime, keep safety stock for observed volatility, and let the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula to avoid overstock given current on-hand+pipeline (1272 units).

Period 13 (2019-09-02) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Promised lead time has been observed stable=1 in concluded periods 2\u201312; use L=1. Demand has softened since Period 8 \u2014 use recent 5-period window (Periods 8\u201312 demands = [533,450,361,222,298], mean=372.8, sample std\u2248122.56).

These parameters reduce target stock from earlier high-regime levels and limit holding cost while preserving service under current softer demand and stable LT=1.

Period 14 (2019-09-16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 14). History shows lead time consistently observed =1 in concluded periods through Period 13. Demand has softened since Period 8; recent 5-period demand (Periods 9\u201313 = [450,361,222,298,286]) has mean=323.4 and std\u224885.7. On-hand = 688, in-transit = 0. I use promised lead time L=1 (stable per concluded history). Forecast (mu_hat) set using recent_5 to capture the softened regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 2 * 323.4 = 646.8. Volatility (sigma_hat) set from recent_5: sqrt(1+L)*std_recent = sqrt(2) * 85.7 = 121.2. These parameters keep the base-stock tied to the current lower demand regime while reflecting observed variability; using a recent window avoids over-ordering from earlier high-demand periods and leverages the stable LT=1 evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable = 1 observed in concluded periods 2\u201313; Demand softened starting Period 8 \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 9\u201313) = 323.4, std \u2248 85.7.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 15). On-hand=406, in-transit=12 (order from Period 14). Concluded history shows stable observed lead time =1 across concluded periods 2\u201313. Demand softened starting Period 8; recent 5-period stats (Periods 9\u201313) show mean=323.4, std\u224885.7. I keep L at the promised 1 (consistent concluded history), use a recent-5 demand window to capture the softened regime, and scale mu/sigma by review+lead (1+L)=2 and sqrt(1+L)=\u221a2 so the OR backend sets a base-stock appropriate for the lower recent demand while reflecting current variance and holding cost ($1 vs profit $2).

Period 16 (2019-10-14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time: concluded periods 2\u201315 show arrivals = orders placed previous period \u2192 keep promised LT=1. Demand has softened since Period 8; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11\u201315 = 222,298,286,282,191) show a lower regime. I set L=1 (default promised). For demand I use recent_N=5 to reflect the new lower mean/volatility: mean over next-review+lead (1+L) \xd7 sample-mean \u2192 mu_hat = 2 \xd7 255.8 = 511.6. Volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L): sigma_hat = sqrt(2) \xd7 sample std(222,298,286,282,191) \u2248 66.1. These parameters reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding while keeping service given low recent demand and stable LT.

Carry-over insight: Demand softened starting Period 8; recent 5-period mean (Periods 11\u201315)=255.8, std\u224846.7; lead time stable =1 observed in concluded periods 2\u201315.

Period 17 (2019-10-28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 17). Lead time has been stable =1 in concluded periods 2\u201316 (arrivals consistently one period after order). Demand has softened since Period 8; recent 5-period window (Periods 11\u201315) shows mean=255.8 and std\u224846.7, so I use a recent-5 forecast to reflect the lower regime and reduced volatility. Using L=1 keeps pipeline timing correct; mu_hat=(1+L)*recent_mean captures demand over review+lead; sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*recent_std to scale variability over the same horizon. These parameters reduce stock relative to earlier high-regime forecasts while preserving service given observed LT stability.

Period 18 (2019-11-11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 18). On-hand=209, in-transit=185 (pipeline total=394). Concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead time=1 in periods 2\u201317 so treat L=1. Recent demand has softened; use the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201317 = [286,282,191,193,139]) which give mean=218.2 and sd\u224863.86. Set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 2*218.2 = 436.4 to target current low-demand regime. Set sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*sd = sqrt(2)*63.86 \u2248 90.33 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 19 (2019-11-25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 19). History shows lead time has been stable at 1 in concluded periods 2\u201318 (arrivals consistently matched orders placed previous period). Demand has softened since Period 8; most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 14\u201318 = 282,191,193,139,136) show a low regime. I use L=1 (promised & observed). For forecasting I use a recent-5 window to capture the current low-demand regime: mean(Periods14\u201318)=188.2 -> mu_hat=(1+L)*mean=2*188.2=376.4. Sample std of those 5 demands \u224859.13 -> sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(2)*59.13 \u224883.64. This raises safety relative to single-period volatility while keeping base stock responsive to the clearly lower demand; it keeps orders conservative to limit holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable = 1 observed in concluded periods 2\u201318; demand softened starting Period 8 \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 14\u201318)=188.2, std\u224859.1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time has been stable =1 in concluded periods 2\u201319; no evidence of delays, so use promised LT=1. Recent demand has softened \u2014 use a recent-5 window (Periods 15\u201319 demands = [191,193,139,136,170], mean=165.8, std\u224827.38). On-hand=170 + in-transit=73 => pipeline=243; using a short recent window keeps forecasts responsive and avoids excess holding given holding cost = $1 > profit?$1? (profit $2, holding $1) the OR backend will convert these to a conservative base-stock. Parameters chosen raise service for current lower-variance regime while limiting inventory buildup.

Period 21 (2019-12-23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 21). Lead time has been observed stable =1 in concluded periods 2\u201320 (arrivals consistently match prior-period orders). Recent demand has softened materially since Period 8; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16\u201320) = [193,139,136,170,119], mean=151.4, sample std\u224829.65. With L=1 the (1+L) window doubles the mean to a forecast mu_hat\u2248302.8 and scales volatility by sqrt(2) to sigma_hat\u224841.95. Current on-hand+in-transit =124+106=230 which is below the forecasted (1+L) demand, so parameters raise target stock modestly while reflecting the low recent variability to limit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stable = 1 observed in concluded periods 2\u201320; demand softened starting Period 8 \u2014 recent 5-period mean (Periods 16\u201320)=151.4, std\u224829.7.
