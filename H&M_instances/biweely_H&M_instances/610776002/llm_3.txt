In-transit=120 corresponds to the order placed in Period 17 and should arrive with LT=1 (i.e., will be available to meet Period18 demand, but you cannot see that arrival when deciding). No overdue/lost orders in concluded history. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, expected arrival this period =120 (from pipeline). Forecasted demand (\u2248230) > expected arrival (120), so we expect a stockout this period and ~110 unmet demand. Orders placed now will arrive next period (LT=1) and cannot affect Period18 sales. e) Final order logic: because ordering now only affects Period19+, balance expected next-period demand (~230) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) and profit ($2/unit sold). With low variance recently and LT=1, place an order to roughly cover one period of expected demand.
