I therefore forecast ~900 units/period (\u22481800 for L+1=2 periods) and remain conservative. c) Lead time & missing orders: Concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times and several overdue shipments: the order placed on Period 3 (300) remains unconcluded for many periods and the order from Period 6 (800) also did not arrive by Period 7; Period 7 ordered=450 likewise not yet concluded.
