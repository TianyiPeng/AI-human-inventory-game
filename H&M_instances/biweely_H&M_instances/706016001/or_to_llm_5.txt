Economics: profit=$2, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile q=2/3 so we target service rather than minimizing inventory; being understocked during holiday is costly. Calculation: target (L+1)-period demand estimate = 2\xd7~2000 \u2248 4000 units (balancing the single large observed spike and recent means). Pipeline covers 1673 units, so order = 4000 \u2212 1673 = 2327 units.

{
  "rationale": "Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=4000. OR recommends 0 (uses long-term historical mean ~1248 and promised L=1). Lead-time observation: recent concluded periods show actual lead time often =1 but some delays/losses have occurred; treat in-transit as somewhat reliable but monitor. Demand outlook: although long-run recent means were lower (~744), Period 19 showed a one-period holiday surge (3774) and Period 20 note indicates near-term elevated demand; today's date (2019-12-23) is in the holiday window so short-run demand risk is higher. Decision logic: we must cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand after ordering. Worst-case near-term elevated demand could be large, but in-transit=4000 already covers ~2 periods even against a high single-period spike (4000 > 3774) and covers multiple periods at recent elevated means. Ordering additional units now risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) with modest incremental profit ($2/unit) and uncertain arrivals. Therefore do not place a new order this period and conserve profit by avoiding extra holding cost; monitor next conclude for actual arrivals and demand before ordering.",
