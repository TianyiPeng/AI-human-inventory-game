Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 1800 (counted as available pipeline for arrivals next period given consistent 1-period lead time). Demand outlook: historical sample mean \u22481,248 units/period but recent elevated demand (two-period averages since 2019/9/2 \u22481,792) and current holiday timing (Dec 23) suggest demand is above historical mean. OR recommended 907 units (base-stock capped) using promised L and historical demand; that recommendation aims to top up pipeline toward a 2-period (L+1) cover. Decision logic: need (L+1)=2 period coverage. If single-period demand is between 1,250\u20131,800, two-period demand \u22482,500\u20133,600. Pipeline 1,800 is short by ~700\u20131,800.
