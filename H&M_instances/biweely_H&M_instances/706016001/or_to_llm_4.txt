Ordering additional units now would arrive next period and likely create excess ending inventory that incurs $1 holding cost per unit while profit per unit is only $2, reducing total reward if overstocks persist. Given current reliable L=1 and substantial pipeline, I follow the conservative approach and place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs while still covering near-term demand from incoming pipeline.

Cost tradeoff: profit=$2, holding=$1 favors some safety stock but holding is material. Decision: place a modest up-weight on OR to protect against observed high recent demand while not overstocking given large in-transit volume. I order 200 units (above OR's 109) to raise pipeline to 2790, giving extra buffer against a one-period demand surge while limiting holding cost exposure.
