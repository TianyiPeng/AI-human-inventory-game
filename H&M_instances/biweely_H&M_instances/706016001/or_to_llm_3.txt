With no pipeline and uncertain actual lead time or lost shipments risk, I want to cover two periods' expected demand to avoid stockouts and lost profit (profit $2/unit). Holding cost is $1/unit/period so overstock is penalized, but the cost of stockouts (lost $2 profit per unmet unit) and the fact we start at zero makes under-ordering costly.

The pipeline of 2497 therefore already covers roughly two review+lead periods. OR recommended 202 units (uses promised L=1 and long-run demand).

Rationale: ordering risks additional units that may be delayed/lost or incur holding cost ($1/unit/period) while the existing pipeline already meets the (L+1)-period coverage target; recent extreme spike (Period19 demand=3774) looks like a one-off given very noisy recent history and would not justify increasing exposure given delivery unreliability.

Demand signal: long-run sample mean single-period \u22481248 (from provided history) and recent observed demands include large spikes (Period 19 demand=3774, Period 20 demand=1337) but those were mostly unmet due to zero on-hand; use conservative long-run mean for planning.
