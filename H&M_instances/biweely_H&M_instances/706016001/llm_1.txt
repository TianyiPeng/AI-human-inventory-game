Promised lead time is 1 period but actual lead time must be inferred from future conclude messages; nothing to infer now. d) Inventory & pipeline: With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit we cannot satisfy Period 1 demand because any order placed now will arrive after this period (lead time \u22651). e) Final order logic: Holding cost is high relative to profit (Profit $2/unit vs Holding $1/unit/period). Since we cannot fulfill current-period demand and future arrivals may be lost or arrive next period, I avoid creating inventory that could incur holding cost before confirmed demand evidence or confirmed reliable arrivals. Conservative policy: do not order until we observe at least one concluded arrival or see demand realized to update forecast/lead-time. Order quantity: 0 units.",
