{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 for many periods (Period 1\u201317 conclues all show arrived with lead_time=0), so any order placed now would arrive in Period 18 before demand. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 107, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand has collapsed from the summer spike to a low regime: Periods 12\u201317 demands = [143,65,100,93,70,59] (6-period mean \u2248 91), last three periods = [93,70,59] (mean \u2248 74) and most recent = 59, indicating current daily demand \u224860\u201375. Cost tradeoff: profit = $2/unit, holding = $1/unit/period (holding cost is 50% of profit) so overstocking quickly erodes objective. OR baseline (560) assumes historical higher demand and uses promised lead time; it ignores the sustained low-demand regime evident since Period 10\u201317. Decision: do not order (order = 0). Rationale: existing on-hand (107) already covers ~1.4\u20131.8 periods at recent demand (74\u219260), avoiding unnecessary holding costs while preserving sales for the near term given lead time = 0. This minimizes holding cost drag while keeping service for expected low demand; if demand rises in future conclues, we will resume ordering given lead-time = 0.",

Using current demand estimate \u2248100/day and critical fractile (profit/(profit+holding)=2/3 \u2192 z\u22480.43) yields small safety stock (~15\u201330).
