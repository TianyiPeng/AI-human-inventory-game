Given (a) lead time observed =0 (so no pipeline uncertainty), (b) zero on-hand/in-transit (so we start exposed this period), and (c) strong evidence of elevated demand (403 recent avg and a 671 realized demand), I will follow the OR recommendation of 462 units to maximize expected sales while limiting excessive holding given the 1-period holding cost.

Recent realized demands are very high: Period 1 demand=671 and Period 2 demand=844, average of these two = 757 units for a single 14-day period; this confirms the previously noted upward demand regime (recent 3+ periods avg \u2248403 and last two much higher).
