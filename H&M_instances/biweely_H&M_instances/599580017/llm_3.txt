With no evidence of delays, plan assuming LT=0 but remain alert for missed/late arrivals in future conclude messages. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Must cover current period demand because arrivals occur after decision phase. e) Final order logic: Balance profit ($2) vs holding cost ($1/period) \u2014 holding is high relative to profit so avoid large overstock. I order approximately one period of expected demand with a small upside for the upward trend: 360 units (aiming to satisfy expected demand ~350\u2013380 while limiting holding exposure).",

{
  "rationale": "a) World knowledge & SKU: Swimwear sees rising demand in spring (late April), supporting higher demand than baseline historical samples. b) Demand regime analysis: Recent concluded periods show strong, stock-constrained demand: Period1 demand=671 (sold 360 due to stockout), Period2 demand=844 (sold 400 due to stockout). These imply true demand >= observed demand and materially above the provided sample series. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Concluded messages confirm actual lead_time=0 for orders placed in Period1 and Period2 (arrived same period). No in-transit units outstanding. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so all demand for Period3 must be satisfied by an order placed now. e) Final order logic: With L=0 we must cover one period of expected demand. Using recent-period average demand \u2248(671+844)/2\u2248758 and biasing slightly upward for seasonal ramp, I forecast \u2248800\u2013900 units. Given Profit=$2/unit vs Holding=$1/unit/period, the cost of a missed sale (lost $2) is larger than one period of holding cost ($1); therefore err on the side of availability.
