Supplier has previously demonstrated lead_time=0 when orders were placed, and currently in-transit=0.

{
  "rationale": "Summary of facts: supplier lead time has been empirically 0 across many periods (arrivals for orders in Periods 1\u201311 all reported lead_time=0). Recent demand regime: clear downshift starting 2019-08-05 \u2014 Periods 10\u201316 demands = [308,294,143,65,100,93,70] \u2192 mean \u2248153 units/period; most recent single-period demand (Period17) = 59 and ending on-hand now = 88 with in-transit = 0. OR baseline (579) uses long-run historical data and promised lead time and therefore massively overstates required order for the current low-demand regime. Objective: maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory each 14-day period. With lead time = 0 empirically, orders arrive the same period (but are only observed next conclude); we must cover current period demand (L+1 =1 period). I adopt the downshift as sustained (Periods 10\u201316) because multiple consecutive low-demand periods occurred and no contrary evidence exists. Target stock: one-period expected demand plus a small safety cushion. Using recent mean \u2248153 and profit/holding tradeoff (q=2/(2+1)=0.6667 \u2192 small safety factor), I choose to bring on-hand inventory to about 153 units. Current on-hand = 88, so order = 153 \u2212 88 = 65 units. This minimizes holding cost while covering expected period demand under the current low-demand regime and corrects OR's over-order. If upcoming periods show renewed demand growth, future orders will be increased accordingly.",

Demand regime has downshifted and remained low since 2019-08-05: recent realized demands (Periods 10\u201318) are low (308,294,143,65,100,93,70,59,164) and prior analysis treated a sustained mean \u2248153 units/period. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order will arrive within the same period (L=0), and the decision must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. OR's recommendation of 652 assumes the older high-demand regime and is far too large given the sustained drop. Using the downshifted mean \u2248153 and a modest safety buffer to avoid stockouts but limit holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period), I order 160 units. This balances expected sales (~153) versus holding penalty for excess inventory; with L=0 this will sell this period up to demand and any small leftover inventory cost is small compared with lost profit from stockouts.",
