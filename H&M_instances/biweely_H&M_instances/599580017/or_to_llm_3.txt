OR's 462 exceeds that base-stock, reflecting a cap/unmodeled choice; however Period 1 demand = 671 (very large spike above historical mean), so there is evidence of a one-time surge or regime shift. Decision tradeoffs: profit per sold unit = $2, holding cost = $1 per unit/period. Over-ordering exposes us to holding cost equal to half the unit profit; under-ordering forgoes $2 profit per missed sale. Given observed lead time = 0, we can safely respond within the same period. Action chosen: increase OR's recommendation moderately to cover upside risk from the observed 671 demand while limiting holding exposure. Final order = 500 units (OR=462 \u2192 +38 units).

Strategy: target a conservative single-period cover given L=0 (need cover only current period after ordering).

OR recommendation (526) is based on older/higher historical mean (~330) and the promised lead time; it does not reflect the sustained recent downward regime or confirmed 0 lead time. Strategy: with lead time = 0 we only need to stock for the current period's demand (and avoid holding cost). Ordering would immediately arrive and increase holding exposure for the coming period. Expected profit per sold unit = $2; holding cost per unit per period = $1, so net benefit from stocking an extra unit is only positive if the unit is likely to sell this period. Current on-hand (141) already matches the recent single-period mean (~141). Therefore I order 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while meeting expected demand.
