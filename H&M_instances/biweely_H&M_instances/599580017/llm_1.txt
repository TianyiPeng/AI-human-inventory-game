Need to cover current period demand (decision happens before arrivals and demand). With mean \u2248330 and start of spring demand likely normal-to-higher, order one period's expected demand (330 units) to maximize expected profit while limiting holding cost exposure. If future periods show late or missing arrivals, will revise safety stock and lead-time inference.",
