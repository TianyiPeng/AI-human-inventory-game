With no in-transit and on-hand=0, treat LT as possibly 0 but allow risk of delay. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 0, so all upcoming demand must be met by new order. Holding cost is high ($1 per unit per period vs $2 profit), so avoid large overstock. e) Final order logic: balance rising seasonal demand (~400) against 50% period holding cost. Order enough to capture expected sales but limit leftover risk. Place a conservative order slightly below recent 3-period average to serve most demand while controlling holding cost.",
