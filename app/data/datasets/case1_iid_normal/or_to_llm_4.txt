Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples were [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111). Actual demand over Periods 1-9 has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100], averaging 93 units. The trend is relatively stable but slightly lower than initial samples. 4. OR Recommendation Analysis: The OR agent recommends 99 units. This is based on a base-stock policy targeting ~120 units (\u03bc + z\u03c3) minus on-hand (21). Given L=0, the 'order + on-hand' covers only the current period. 5. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 99 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward in the final period (Period 50). Analysis of historical data shows that demand has been consistently stable, centering around a mean of approximately 100-110 units per period, with occasional spikes up to 154 units. The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 3 units. The OR recommendation is 117 units. Since this is the final period of the game, there is no value in holding inventory at the end (ending inventory incurs a cost of $1.0/unit and provides no future benefit), but there is a significant profit of $4.0/unit for every unit sold. To maximize profit while minimizing holding cost, I should order exactly enough to meet the expected demand for this period minus the current on-hand inventory. Looking at the last 10 periods, the average demand is 109.1 units. The OR recommendation of 117 units acts as a safe 'base-stock' level that accounts for recent variability. I will place an order for 117 units to ensure we have a total of 120 units available for sale (117 ordered + 3 on-hand), which should cover most demand scenarios without leaving excessive costly surplus.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 117 units to reach a total availability of 120 units. This maximizes potential sales for the final period while keeping the risk of high holding costs low.",
