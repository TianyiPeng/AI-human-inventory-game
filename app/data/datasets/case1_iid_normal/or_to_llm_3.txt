Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The session is in its final period (Period 50). The primary objective is to maximize profit by meeting demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs on the final unsold units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive and be available to satisfy Period 50 demand immediately. Historically, Period 50 demand averages around 100-110 units based on the recent 10-period trend. The OR recommendation is 117 units. Current on-hand inventory is 3 units. To minimize total waste in the final period, I will order exactly 117 units as recommended by the OR. This targets an available stock of 120 (3 on-hand + 117 new), which is slightly above the recent average and should cover potential demand spikes without incurring excessive final holding costs, given the profit margin of $4.0 vs. $1.0 holding cost.",
