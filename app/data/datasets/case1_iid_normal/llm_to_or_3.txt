Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit margin of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Historical demand over the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] averages 111.4 with a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available for current demand. Since this is the first period, I will use the default methods as they incorporate all historical data provided (N=5). My goal is for the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for this period (L+1 = 1 period).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed an actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand was 108 units, which is consistent with the provided historical samples (mean ~111). We currently have 19 units on hand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the review period plus the lead time (1+0 = 1 period). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, leading to a safety stock level. Since we have only one observation in the current game environment plus historical data, using all available samples is appropriate. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full demand history (112, 97, 116, 138, 94, plus the recent 108).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we analyze the performance of 'chips(Regular)'. In the first two periods, we observed actual lead times of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] from historical data and [108, 74] from the game history. The recent demand of 74 is the lowest observed so far, but with only two data points in the game, it's too early to confirm a downward trend. Current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Given $4 profit and $1 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for a healthy service level. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since the actual lead time (0) has been consistent. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (including history) to stabilize the base stock calculation, as the current demand volatility (dropping from 108 to 74) suggests we shouldn't overreact to a single low period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from the historical demand data list) and [108, 74, 119] for the concluding periods P1-P3. The average of all available demand samples is approximately 107 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and the observed lead time for periods 1, 2, and 3 has consistently been 0. I will use the default lead time (0) and default statistical methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline behavior, as there is no evidence of a sustained demand regime shift or lead-time drift yet. The system will calculate base stock using the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) to maintain an appropriate service level for the 0-period lead time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 111.4 units across the first 5 periods (including past demands: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94 and game history: 108, 74, 119, 124). There is a slight upward trend in demand over the last two periods (119 and 124). The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by the 'Period X conclude' messages showing arrivals in the same period they were ordered. To ensure enough stock for the upcoming period while minimizing the risk of a stockout (as Period 4 ended with 0 inventory), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior. The sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand shows a mean of approximately 111 units, but with notable variability (Range: 51-138). Period 5 showed a significant drop to 51 units, which is a potential outlier or a shift. Given the product (Regular Chips), demand is usually stable but can fluctuate based on promotions or local events. Using all 10 available demand points (5 from pre-history, 5 from game history) provides a broader baseline, but I will prioritize recent data slightly via a 10-period window to capture the current trend while damping the shock of the Period 5 drop. Lead time will remain at 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 6 completed periods (actual lead time = 0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear sustained regime shift yet. The last 6 periods of historical data show demands of 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, and 67, while the pre-game data showed [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the average of the most recent 6 periods gives 90.5 units, while the pre-game average was 111.4 units. Since there is a slight downward trend in the recent periods (avg 90.5 vs earlier 111), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability and mean more accurately than the long-term average. L remains 'default' since it matches the observed actual lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (Periods 1-7) confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory levels have stayed relatively stable, though ending inventory is currently low (14 units). Demand shows fluctuations but no clear structural shift yet (mean over past 5 pre-game samples was ~111, mean over Periods 1-7 is ~92). Since demand tends to vary between ~50 and ~125, and current inventory is low, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current mean and volatility. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for the current demand environment while targeting a high service level (Profit $4, Holding $1 results in a 0.8 critical ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 9. Looking at the history (Periods 1-8 and the pre-game data), the demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but stays within a range of 51 to 138. The mean of the recent demand (last 8 periods) is approximately 92.25, while the mean of all history (including pre-game) is 101.4. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 to P8 arriving in the same period it was placed. There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory (on-hand 24, in-transit 0). Given the fluctuations, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the most recent mean and volatility trends while maintaining a sufficient sample size to mitigate outliers like the low demand of 51 in Period 5. This approach balances the need to be responsive to recent patterns while ensuring the base stock level (target = 1.0 * mean + z * sigma) is robust against demand spikes observed in the pre-game data.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-9 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 15 units. Historical demand across the 9 completed periods shows a mean of approximately 93.1 units and a standard deviation of 23.3 units. There were no obvious regime shifts in demand, so I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which leverages all available samples (9 historical periods + 5 training samples). The OR backend uses a service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8, which is appropriate for balancing stockouts against holding costs for this product.

Daily Reward (R_t): $275.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 10 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 91.7 units across all periods. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is slightly lower at 88.2 units (67, 103, 92, 100, 79), and the volatility remains stable. Given that holding costs are 25% of the profit ($1/$4), the service level targeted by the OR backend (q = 0.8) is relatively high. I will use a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader baseline while remaining responsive to the current trend. L is set to default as 0-period delivery is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility but remains relatively stable with a mean around 95-100 units. Period 11 saw a stockout where demand (122) exceeded available inventory (112), resulting in 10 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Throughout Periods 1-11, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the starting on-hand inventory for Period 12 is 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to ensure the order placed this period is sufficient to cover Period 12's demand. I will use a recent window of 5 periods (Periods 7-11) to capture the current demand mean (~99.2) and standard deviation while maintaining the lead time at the observed 0 periods. The base stock calculation by the OR engine with these parameters will target an appropriate service level given the Profit ($4) to Holding Cost ($1) ratio (critical ratio $4/($4+$1) = 0.80).

The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time observed = 0). Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, I need to ensure the order covers the expected demand for the current period (Period 13). Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), demand values are [92, 100, 79, 122, 119], averaging 102.4. However, the last two periods averaged 120.5. Given the stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the higher recent volatility and levels while maintaining a slightly broader sample than just 2 periods to avoid overreacting to a single spike. The lead time method remains default (0).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, with the most recent 13 periods showing a mean of 96.5. There was a slight increase in demand in Periods 11 and 12 (122 and 119), which caused stockouts, suggesting we should stay responsive. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining stability. Period 13 demand was 102, which returned closer to the long-term average compared to the previous two periods. The current on-hand inventory is 16 units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help tune the base stock to target a service level that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a slight upward trend in recent periods (P11-P14). The mean demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 99.1, while the mean over the most recent 4 periods is 117.75. Given the high stockout frequency in periods 11, 12, and 14 (ending inventory of 0 and sold < demand), a slight increase in mu_hat is warranted to improve the service level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=8 to capture the current demand level while smoothing out period-to-period volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect recent variability.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a slight upward trend in mean and volatility compared to the initial historical samples. Over the last 15 periods, the observed demand mean is approximately 100 units, but the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show higher volatility with demands of 122, 119, 102, 128, and 112 (mean = 116.6). The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by history (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (8 units). I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher demand regime and ensure the OR engine orders enough to meet demand and replenish inventory levels. L remains default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 11: mean demand increased from ~90-100 to 116.6 over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a clear regime shift. From periods 1 to 10, demand was relatively stable with a mean around 90. Starting Period 11, demand surged, resulting in stockouts in three out of the last six periods (P11, P12, P14). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is 110.33, compared to the earlier historical average. However, Period 16 saw a dip to 79, which likely indicates typical volatility rather than a reversal of the high-demand trend. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a 0.8 critical fractile), I will use the last 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent high-demand regime while tempering the extreme spikes. Lead time (L) consistently remains at 0 based on all 16 concluded periods, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift in the regime starting around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand has risen significantly compared to the early stages of the game. Specifically, the demands for the last 7 periods are [122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109], averaging approximately 110.1 units per period, which aligns with the Carry-over Insight from Period 16. The promised and actual lead times consistently remain at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this higher demand regime while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=$4, Holding=$1, Critical Ratio=0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7. This filters out the lower demand from the initial periods and focuses on the current trend. L will remain 'default' as the lead time of 0 has proven stable.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 11, which was previously noted in the carry-over insights. Over the last 8 periods (Period 11-18), the mean demand is approximately 105.8 units, while the most recent 3 periods (16-18) show a lower average of 88 units. However, looking at the full period since the regime shift starting at Period 11, the demand remains higher than the initial 10 periods (avg ~91.8). Given the volatility (demand swings between 74 and 128), I will use N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately while smoothing recent low-demand outliers like Period 18. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift in consumption patterns. From Period 1 to 10, the mean demand was approximately 91.7. Since Period 11, the demand has averaged approximately 107.7 (last 9 periods). Over the most recent 10 periods (P10-P19), the average demand is 108.9. The on-hand inventory is currently at 1 unit, and with a promised lead time of 0 (consistently held in history), the replenishment must arrive within the same period to meet demand. I will use a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to prioritize the new regime while maintaining enough data for volatility estimation. The service level target (profit $4, holding $1) is high (0.8), necessitating a buffer against the higher observed peaks (max 128).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~92 (P1-10) to ~108 (P11-19), an increase of approximately 17%. The volatility remains moderate but peaks reaching 128 units justify a higher base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 21. Previous insights confirmed a demand regime shift around Period 11, where mean demand stabilized at a higher level (approx. 108 units) compared to the initial 10 periods (approx. 92 units). The most recent period (P20) saw demand of 99 units and an ending inventory of 23. Reviewing the lead time history from 'Period X conclude' messages, every order from P1 through P20 arrived with lead_time=0. Thus, we maintain L=0. To capture the current demand regime, I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This period range (P11-P20) aligns with the detected shift and provides a representative sample of the current mean and volatility while excluding the lower-demand period from the start of the game. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the increased average demand and protects against the observed peaks reaching 120+ units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime that began around Period 11. Over the last 11 periods (P11-P21), the mean demand is approximately 105.7 units, compared to the earlier average of ~91.7 (P1-P10). Recent demand in the last 3 periods (P19-P21) has been 122, 99, and 95, averaging 105.3. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=11) to capture the current regime's higher mean while maintaining the default sigma_hat to account for historical volatility and ensure adequate safety stock. Lead time remains default (0).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 11) has stabilized at a higher mean than the initial 10 periods. Specifically, evaluating the last 12 periods (P11-P22), the average demand is 104.0 units, compared to ~91 in the first 10 periods. The last 5 periods (P18-P22) average 91 units, but this includes some lower volatility periods (76, 83) and high peaks (122). Observed actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the current regime's higher mean while accounting for recent volatility. This ensures the base stock remains reactive to the 'new normal' identified in previous insights.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 following a stockout in Period 23 where demand (131) exceeded available supply (119). Historical analysis confirms a lead time of 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. A demand regime shift was identified around Period 11, with the mean demand increasing from approximately 92 to 106 units. Over the last 13 periods (P11-P23), the average demand is 106.1 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Since the profit per unit ($4.0) is significantly higher than the holding cost ($1.0), the service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) justifies a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime and ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and recent volatility to minimize further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable since Period 11 shift: mean demand approximately 106 units (observed P11-P23), up from previous mean of 92 (~15% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 106 units, compared to the earlier average of ~92 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 24 completed periods. Current on-hand inventory is 26 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will continue to use the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focused on the current regime starting at Period 11 (N=14) to ensure the base stock is calculated using the most relevant data. The lead time (L) remains at the default of 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since the regime shift identified around Period 11. Analysis of the last 15 periods (P11-P25) shows a mean demand of approximately 104.8 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~92 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and serve demand within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently low (32 units) and no units are in-transit, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 15-period window to capture the current stable demand level while maintaining responsiveness to recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculated by the OR backend (z* \u2248 0.84 for a critical ratio of 0.8) is sufficient to minimize lost sales without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units (P11-P26 average is 104.5) compared to the initial mean of 92 (P1-P10). The last three periods show consistent demand (96, 89, 91), supporting this stable regime. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To optimize for the service level (Profit=$4, Holding=$1, Target Crit Ratio = 0.8), I will use recent_N=16 (covering the stable high-demand period since Period 11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~104) and volatility appropriately. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a stable demand regime since Period 11, with demand consistently averaging around 106 units. Over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is 105.5 units, which aligns with previous carry-over insights. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 6 units. To maintain an optimal service level while managing holding costs (Profit $4, Holding $1 results in a high target service level), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the most current stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculation. This N=10 window is sufficient to smooth out minor fluctuations while staying responsive to the established post-Period 11 demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 29. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed without any deviations or lost shipments. The demand remains in the regime established around Period 11. Specifically, looking at the most recent 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is approximately 102.8 units with a standard deviation of about 15.6. This is consistent with previous carry-over insights noting a stable regime around 106-108 units. Given the consistency of this 18-period regime (P11-P28), I will use N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current behavior while ensuring enough data points for statistical stability. The backend will calculate the order size using a base stock policy (target ~123-125 units) based on these parameters and the 0-period lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable higher regime since Period 11. Over the last 19 periods (P11-P29), the mean demand is approximately 105.1 units, compared to the mean of 86 units observed in P1-P10. Short-term demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 102.4 units, showing consistent behavior. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To maintain the target service level given the higher demand regime, I am setting L=0 (explicitly to match historical performance) and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 to capture the entirety of the current stable regime (P11-P29). This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers expected demand and volatility based on the most relevant historical segment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since the regime shift around Period 11. Over the last 20 periods (P11-P30), the average demand is approximately 104.5 units, which is consistent with the carry-over insight of ~106 units. The volatility is moderate, with demand typically ranging between 80 and 130 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To maintain an optimal service level and minimize stockouts (which occurred in P11, P12, P14, and P23 when on-hand inventory was insufficient to meet spikes), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current regime's behavior. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand reached 154 units, which is a significant spike and the highest observed in the dataset. This exceeds the recent mean (approx 106-110 units) and has resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike may indicate a new demand regime or a seasonal event, especially considering previous shifts recorded in carry-over insights. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this high-demand signal, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to prioritize the elevated demand levels seen since Period 21. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Using N=10 captures the most recent stability and the sudden jump in Period 31, allowing the OR backend to adjust the base stock higher for protection.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand surge starting Period 31: observed demand of 154 units is the highest recorded, significantly exceeding the previous regime average of ~106 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 154 units in Period 31 followed by 90 units in Period 32 suggests a volatile but elevated demand period. While 154 was an outlier compared to the P11-P30 mean (~102), the average over the last few periods (P29-P32) is approximately 116. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased mean and volatility while protecting against stockouts. The actual lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'ordered on Period 32, lead_time was 0 periods' in the Period 32 conclude message.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant spike in Period 31 (154 units), followed by a return to lower levels in Period 32 (90 units) and Period 33 (87 units). Current on-hand inventory is 48. Previous carry-over insights identified a regime shift around Period 11 (mean ~106-108). The Period 31 surge was likely an outlier or a very short-term peak. Averaging demand from Period 31 to 33 gives 110.33, while the broader regime (P11-P33) averages approximately 105. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), which implies a target service level of 80%, I will prioritize covering the sustained regime mean while accounting for the recent volatility. I will use recent_N with N=23 to capture the entire current regime stable since Period 11, which provides a robust estimate of both mean and standard deviation for the backend's base-stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge observed in Period 31 (154 units) appears to be an outlier or a very short-term spike, as the subsequent periods (32-34) have returned to a lower mean (90, 87, 80). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 104 units, but the most recent 3-period average is significantly lower at 85.7 units. However, to maintain a safe service level and avoid stockouts seen previously, I will use a window of N=10 to set mu_hat, which captures the recent stabilizing trend while factoring in the Period 31 spike to provide a buffer for volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current regime's behavior (approx. 104 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $453.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 35 was 115, following a series of lower values (90, 87, 80). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is approximately 102.9, while the last 5 periods (P31-P35) average 105.2. Period 31 was an outlier at 154, but subsequent demand has reverted closer to the established regime of ~106-110 units. Although there isn't a sustained 'new' trend, the inventory is currently low (7 units) and Period 35's demand showed a spike compared to the immediate prior 3 periods. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable-but-elevated regime since Period 11, which includes both the lower recent periods and the Period 31 spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

The recent demand history indicates a potential second regime shift or increased volatility starting around Period 31. Recent demands are [154, 90, 87, 80, 115, 128], with an average of 109. Since Period 31, we've seen two spikes (154 and 128) that reached stockout levels even with same-period arrivals (L=0). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the history of all concluded periods. To prevent stockouts during these high-demand periods while managing holding costs, I am shifting to a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=7 (covering the high-demand spike from Period 31 to current). This allows the OR backend to adjust to the higher mean (~109) and increased variance observed lately, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently reactive to the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 31: Mean remains around 106-109, but frequent spikes (154 in P31, 128 in P36) are causing regular stockouts at standard inventory levels.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean that established around Period 31. Recent demand samples starting from Period 31 are [154, 90, 87, 80, 115, 128, 97]. While the average of this specific segment is approximately 107 units, the recurrent spikes (154, 128, 115) combined with the 0-period lead time environment suggest that the system must maintain a higher base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 31 and 36. Since P31, demand mean remains close to 108, but standard deviation has increased significantly compared to the P11-P30 regime. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture this current high-volatility regime and use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against these frequent peaks, targeting a value that accommodates demand up to ~135-140 units given the high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1). Lead time remains 'default' (0 periods) as all orders have arrived same-period as promised.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been characterized by a mean of approximately 106 units, but with significantly increased volatility since Period 31 (spikes of 154 and 128). This volatility has caused several stockouts (P31, P36) when the inventory position was set too low relative to these peaks. Current on-hand inventory is 50. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period), so the base stock must cover Period 39's demand. Our target service level (q) is 0.8 (4 / (4 + 1)). Given the recent volatility and the risk of lost sales (underage cost > overage cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P31-P38) to capture this higher mean and variance regime, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for these recent high-demand events while maintaining efficiency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P31-P39) shows an increase in volatility despite a stable mean. We've seen a spike of 154 (P31) and 128 (P36), while other periods have dipped into the 70s and 80s. The current on-hand inventory is 48 units. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period), we should aim for a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (P40) plus a safety buffer to handle potential spikes like those seen in P31 and P36. The mean demand across the last 9 periods (P31-P39) is approximately 101, but the standard deviation has increased due to the spikes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this increased volatility and the slightly shifted mean, ensuring 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the current 'spiky' regime to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11 and further stabilized with higher volatility starting Period 31. Recent demand observations (P31-P40) show an average of approximately 104 units with high variance (spikes up to 154). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. To manage the current volatility and avoid stockouts observed in P31 and P36, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most recent behavior since the Period 31 volatility increase. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the current mean and the increased standard deviation, which is necessary to maintain service levels with a profit margin of 4x holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to show high volatility and a sustained higher mean. Over the last 11 periods (P31-P41), demand has averaged approximately 107 units, but with significant spikes reaching as high as 154 (P31). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in history. To manage the increased volatility and prevent the stockouts observed in recent spikes (e.g., P31, P36, and nearly P40-41), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 to specifically capture this more volatile regime that began at Period 31. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the higher average demand and the increased standard deviation seen in recent weeks, ensuring better service levels while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P42) shows a mean of approximately 104 units with significant spikes (e.g., 154 in P31, 128 in P36) and higher frequency of near-stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 11 units. In the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 101.4, which is lower than the P31 peak but still elevated compared to early history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical fractile is 0.8, justifying safety stock to prevent these frequent stockouts. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'high-volatility' regime that started around Period 31, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the increased demand variance seen in the last dozen periods. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 31, with a mean of approximately 105.5 units and a standard deviation of 21.6 units (calculated from P31-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 42 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To continue satisfying this higher demand and account for the spikes observed (max 154), I will use the recent 13-period window (P31-P43) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current mean and volatility rather than the much lower historical averages from early in the game (P1-P10 mean was ~92).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 31, with a mean demand of approximately 105.7 units (P31-P44 average). Recently, demand has been moderate (116, 119, 114, 83, 106), but historical spikes (up to 154) necessitate a safety stock buffer to prevent stockouts, especially with the 0-period lead time. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am using recent_N (N=14, reflecting the regime since the P31 shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the increased variance, which balances the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1) against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated following the Period 31 shift; while the mean has stayed near ~106, the standard deviation is higher than in the initial periods, requiring higher mu_hat/sigma_hat parameters to cover potential spikes like the 154 units seen in Period 31.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime since Period 31, with a mean demand approximately around 106-109 units and frequent spikes (e.g., 154 units in P31, 128 units in P36). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs. $1 holding cost (critical ratio ~0.8), I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 15 periods (starting from P31). This N=15 window captures the current high-volatility regime and ensures we have enough safety stock to prevent stockouts during demand peaks without over-ordering excessively as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a stable demand regime established around Period 31, characterized by a mean of approximately 106 units but with increased volatility (peaks up to 154). Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is 100.1 units, but the strategy must account for the high variance observed since Period 31 to prevent stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by all past 'conclude' messages. To capture the current volatility and mean accurately, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16, which covers the data since the significant volatility shift at Period 31. This provides enough data points to stabilize the volatility estimate while staying relevant to the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we experienced a stockout with demand (122) exceeding starting on-hand (121). The 'chips(Regular)' item has a 0-period lead time, meaning orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. The mean demand since the Period 31 volatility shift is approximately 104.7 units, but the high variance (max 154) necessitates a buffer. With the game ending in Period 50, we must ensure we cover the remaining two periods without over-stocking. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=17, covering the Period 31 shift) to capture the current mean of ~105 and sigma_hat with the same N to account for recent spikes. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

The recent demand data (P31-P48) confirms the regime shift identified in the carry-over insights, with a mean demand of approximately 105 units and significantly increased volatility (SD ~19), including a peak of 154. Since the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms actual lead time (W) is consistently 0 (arrived in the same period), I will set L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=18 (covering the period from the P31 shift to the present) to capture this higher volatility regime. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the frequent spikes and maintains a high service level while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $463.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues within the regime established around Period 31, characterized by a mean of approximately 106-108 units and increased volatility (intermittent spikes up to 154). Recent demand (Periods 45-49: 103, 105, 122, 106, 117) averages 110.6 units, slightly higher than the regime average, suggesting a sustained high-demand period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels (80% critical ratio) and mitigate stockout risks seen in Period 47, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20 to capture the post-Period 31 volatility and mean) and sigma_hat (N=20) to ensure the base stock accounts for the recent variance. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time is consistently 0.
