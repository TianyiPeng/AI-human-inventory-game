Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], giving a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since there's no history of actual lead times yet, I will use the default lead time. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior, which appears relatively stable around the 110-120 range. The backend will calculate base_stock based on the service level q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 108 units for 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand data provided [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] has a mean of 111.4. The observed demand of 108 is consistent with this historical mean. The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0 (ordered 127, arrived 127 in the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 19. Since the lead time is 0, we need to ensure our order plus current inventory satisfies the immediate period's demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the historical samples and the initial observation to maintain a steady stock level.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows recent samples of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] from the pre-game data, and [108, 74] from the first two periods of the game. Comparing the average of the last 5 pre-game samples (111.4) with the two game periods (91.0), there is some volatility but no confirmed regime shift yet. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to weight all observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a stable baseline until more data confirms a specific trend or seasonality, as the sample size is still quite small (7 total samples).

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 4. Based on the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (Orders from P1, P2, and P3 all arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (initial) followed by the observed demands in the game: P1=108, P2=74, P3=119. The mean demand over these 8 samples is approximately 107 units. The most recent demand (P3=119) and the ending inventory (4 units) suggest that demand remains relatively stable but high enough to deplete stock if not replenished fully. I will use 'default' for lead time (L=0) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while smoothing out the dip seen in P2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-4 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (all orders arrived the same period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is 4 units. Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including pre-game and game history) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and specifically [108, 74, 119, 124] during the game. There is no clear shift or seasonality detected yet as we are only in Period 5. I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 0) and the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent demand variability observed during the game sessions, ensuring the base stock calculation (which targets a service level of approx 0.8 based on profit $4 and holding $1) covers the upcoming period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 5 completed periods (orders placed in N arrived in N). Average demand over the last 5 periods is 95.2 units, while the pre-game history (which includes [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]) had a higher average. Period 5 saw a notable drop in demand (51 units), which pulled the average down. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while smoothing out the Period 5 outlier. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility (std dev ~31). Since the observed lead time is consistently 0, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to let the backend use the actual historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant decrease in the last two periods (51 and 67) compared to the initial five-period average and the historical data provided (which ranged from 94 to 138). Specifically, the mean of the first four active periods was roughly 106, whereas the last two average 59. This suggests a potential regime shift or a temporary lull. Given the on-hand inventory of 55, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for a potential return to previous levels. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by shipping history. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current lower volatility environment (last few periods have been less erratic than the start).

Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 8. The product is chips(Regular). Historical demand across the first 7 periods shows fluctuations (108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103), with a mean of approximately 92.2 and a standard deviation of 27.8. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which has been consistently observed in all 7 periods (W=0). On-hand inventory is low (10 units), and there are no units in transit because lead time is 0. Since there's no evidence of a regime shift or seasonality (no specific calendar dates provided), I will use the recent N samples to capture the historical variability while giving weight to recent observations to ensure adequate service levels. I select N=7 (all available history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the observed variability and mean demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as seen in the game history where all orders from Period 1 to Period 8 arrived within the same period they were placed. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations over the first 8 periods (ranging from 51 to 124) plus the 5 initial samples provided. The mean demand of the game history periods (Periods 1-8) is approximately 92.25, while the initial 5 samples averaged 111.4. There is no clear sustained shift or seasonality visible yet in the generic 'Period_X' labels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to focus on the active game performance for both mean and standard deviation, which captures the current variability while providing enough sample size to buffer against stockouts. This setup ensures the base stock calculation reflects recent volatility (standard deviation) and the current average consumption rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 9 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows no significant trend or seasonal shift, oscillating around a mean. The recent 5-period demand average is 82.6 units, while the lifetime average is 93.1 units. Since demand dropped notably in Periods 5 and 6 before recovering, I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture the overall volatility while staying responsive to the full range of observed behavior. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target an 80th percentile service level. Setting L to default (0) and mu/sigma to recent_N=9 ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current stable but variable demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable over the last 10 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 91.7 units. The recorded demands are [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79]. There is no strong evidence of a significant regime shift or seasonal pattern yet, though the volatility is moderate. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'default' method for L (lead time = 0) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand distribution while filtering out the initialization data (periods -5 to 0). This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1), aiming for approximately an 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80).

Daily Profit: $448.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand was 122 units but only 112 units were sold because the starting inventory (plus same-day arrival) was exhausted, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand over the last 11 periods has shown some volatility but remains relatively centered around a mean of ~94 units (Recent demands: 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122). To minimize the risk of stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs (given profit is 4x the holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the most relevant demand distribution. Since the lead time is 0, the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will effectively cover one period of demand (Period 12). Setting L to 'default' reflects the observed 0-period lead time.

The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, leading to a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). Current observation shows zero stock on-hand and zero units in-transit, following two periods (Period 11 and 12) where demand exceeded supply, resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). Historical demand across the last 12 periods is approximately 96.5 units/period (total 1158 units), but recent demand is slightly higher (last 3 periods average 106.7). Given the stockout state, I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand trend (last 5 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for current volatility and avoids further under-stocking. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to maintain the observed 0-period trend and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 13 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has averaged approximately 96.9 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, ensuring that the ending inventory usually reflects demand fluctuations. However, in Periods 11 and 12, the system recorded lost sales because demand (122 and 119) exceeded the available stock (starting on-hand 112 and 115). Period 13 demand was 102, leaving 16 units on hand. To capture current demand dynamics and prevent stockouts while maintaining a healthy service level (profit/ratio = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I will use the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period range covers recent high demand spikes (Period 11, 12) and more moderate demand (Period 10, 13). Lead time L is set to default (0).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 99 units over the last 14 periods, but there has been a slight upward trend in recent periods (P11-P14 show demands of 122, 119, 102, 128). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. We have stocked out in three of the last four periods (P11, P12, P14), indicating that our current base_stock levels (governed by the OR engine's default stats) are slightly under-covering the high-side realizations. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (mean ~110) to better capture this recent higher demand regime and prevent stockouts. sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent volatility. L remains 0 as confirmed by all 'Period conclude' logs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 11 onwards: Mean demand increased from ~95 to ~118 units across the last 4 periods, leading to frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 15 units with 0 in-transit. A demand regime shift was previously identified starting around Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), observed demands were [122, 119, 102, 128, 112], yielding a recent mean of 116.6 units, compared to the earlier periods (P1-P10) which averaged roughly 91 units. This increased demand led to stockouts in Periods 11, 12, and 14. To capture this sustained higher demand level while maintaining responsiveness, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using method 'recent_N' with N=5. This aligns the base stock calculation with the current higher-demand regime (L=0, so mu_hat reflects 1 period of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in behavior. Starting from Period 11, the mean demand has increased compared to the initial periods. Observed demands since Period 11 are: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112, and 79. The mean of these last 6 samples is approximately 110.3, higher than the long-term average including the seed data. Period 16 showed a dip (79), but high demand events (122, 119, 128) are frequent and have caused several stockouts (Periods 11, 12, 14). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this shift while acknowledging the recent volatility (Period 16's drop), I will use a recent window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the higher average demand (requiring higher base stock) with the observed standard deviation in this new regime, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient service level for the $4 profit margin vs $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural increase starting around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand is approximately 110 units, compared to a lower mean in periods 1-10. Stockouts occurred in Periods 11, 12, and 14, indicating that the baseline stock levels were insufficient for this new regime. Although the last two periods saw lower demand (79 and 109), the volatility remains significant. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the higher mean and variance observed in this current regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that prevents further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand elevation.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 11-18) confirms the regime shift noted in Period 15. The mean demand in this recent window is approximately 106 units (122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109, 76), which is higher than the initial average but has shown significant volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a window of N=8 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this higher-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to maintain a buffer that prevents the stockouts seen between Periods 11 and 14. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time observed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 11-19) confirms the regime shift noted in the carry-over insights, with demand frequently exceeding 110-120 units and causing stockouts. The average demand across the last 9 periods is approximately 110 units, compared to the earlier baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by immediate arrivals in history. To prevent stockouts and maximize profit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=9) to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility. This should ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand environment while keeping holding costs manageable.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 11 to Period 20 confirms the previously identified regime shift. During these 10 periods, the mean demand is approximately 106.8 units (122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109, 76, 122, 99), which is higher than the initial five-period average (~111 but with higher volatility earlier). Notably, there have been multiple stockouts (Periods 11, 12, 14), suggesting that the service level needs to be maintained effectively. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as observed in all concluded periods (P1 to P20). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand characteristic (mean ~107) while maintaining enough history to account for the observed volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the higher mean demand while accounting for recent variation, preventing further stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand stabilized around 107 units (P11-P20) compared to higher initial volatility; lead time consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift starting at Period 11. Between Periods 1 and 10, the mean demand was approximately 91.7 units. From Period 11 to Period 21 (the last 11 periods), the mean demand increased to approximately 105.7 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given this sustained change, I will use a window of N=11 (all samples since the changepoint) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide the OR backend with the most accurate reflection of the current demand regime and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and maintains an appropriate service level (q=0.80) while minimizing holding costs on the 27 units currently on hand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 11-22) indicates a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 101.8 units, though there's moderate volatility (Std Dev \u2248 16.5). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period conclude' messages where orders placed in Period N arrive in the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs (Profit $4.0 vs Holding $1.0), I will use the last 12 periods (P11-P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the regime shift noted in the Carry-over Insights. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system experienced a stockout (demand 131 vs 119 available), indicating the recent demand volatility is higher than anticipated. Since Period 11, the demand has been elevated, but the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show a mean of ~106 with a significant spike to 131 in the latest period. Lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (given profit $4 vs holding cost $1), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 (covering the higher-demand regime from P11 to P23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=13 captures the full extent of the current demand regime's mean and variability, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that better protects against spikes like the one seen in P23 while accounting for the lopsided profit/cost ratio.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift around Period 11, with recent periods (P11-P24) showing a mean demand of approximately 107.4 units compared to the earlier periods. Recent demand in Period 23 spiked to 131, resulting in a stockout, but reverted to 96 in Period 24. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.8. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime that started at Period 11, which provides enough samples to stabilize the mean and variance while ignoring the early-period lower-demand data. L remains at default (0).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a level shift around Period 11, moving from an initial mean of ~95 to approximately 105-110 units, though volatility remains present. Over the last 15 periods (P11-P25), the mean demand is 104.2, and for the last 5 periods (P21-P25), it is 98.8. The current lead time is consistently 0, as evidenced by 'Period 25 conclude' showing the order from Period 25 arrived within the same period. Since on-hand inventory is 32 and in-transit is 0, setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 captures the current regime's higher demand level compared to the very beginning, while avoiding over-reacting to the slight dip in the most recent 5 periods. I will use recent_N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with the detected regime shift starting at Period 11, ensuring the base-stock calculation reflects current mean and variance. L is set to default (0) as the promised lead time holds.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around a mean of approximately 98-102 units over the last several periods (P21-P26: 95, 83, 131, 96, 89, 91). While P23 showed a spike to 131, the recent three periods (P24-P26) have settled into a range of 89-96. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend aims for a cycle service level of approximately 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (P17-P26) while smoothing out the minor fluctuations. This N value covers the recent shift confirmed in the Period 21 insight and maintains a responsive yet stable forecast.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since the regime shift around Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P23-P27), the demand values were 131, 96, 89, 91, and 113, resulting in a mean of 104 units. This aligns with the previous insight that demand stabilized around 107 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the current ending inventory of 1 unit and 0 in-transit, I will set the lead time parameter to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the stabilized post-shift demand characteristics (Periods 18-27) while filtering out the earlier higher volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 104.2 units over the last 18 periods (P11-P28) and 100.8 units over the most recent 10 periods (P19-P28). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 18, which covers the entire stable regime post-Period 11. This captures the current demand mean and volatility while excluding the higher variance observed in the initial 10 periods. The base stock policy with these parameters will balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable following the regime shift identified around Period 11. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the mean demand is approximately 100.6 units (99, 95, 83, 131, 96, 89, 91, 113, 109, 110). While there are occasional spikes (e.g., 131 in P23), the average has settled near 100. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the current volatility (std dev approx 14.5). The OR backend with L=0 will target a base stock sufficient to cover one period of demand plus safety stock at an ~80% service level (Profit $4 / (4+1)).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable following the regime shift identified around Period 11. Over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the mean demand is approximately 101.8 units with a standard deviation of 14.5. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for immediate restocking within the same period. Given the current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window captures the current stable demand regime while filtering out earlier volatility. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate as the system has consistently met the promised 0-period lead time. This configuration allows the OR backend to target a base stock level that covers the immediate demand with a high service level (calculated as 4/(4+1) = 80%), effectively balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 31 spiked to 154 units, which is significantly higher than the stable mean of ~107 units observed since Period 11. This spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the product 'chips(Regular)' and the sudden jump, I need to account for increased volatility while maintaining the current lead time estimate (L=0). I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the recent stable period (P21-P30) while incorporating the effect of the Period 31 spike to ensure better service levels and safety stock without over-responding to a single outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Potential upward demand shift or high-variance event at Period 31 (demand 154 vs recent mean ~107). Stockout occurred.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, a significant demand spike occurred (154 units), confirming a high-variance event or a new regime shift that justifies an adjustment in parameters to prevent stockouts. While Period 32 demand returned to a lower level (90 units), history since Period 11 shows a mean demand of approximately 107-111 units with periodic spikes exceeding 120. The current on-hand inventory of 37 units is low relative to the potential for another spike. To capture the recent increase in mean and variance, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=10 (covering Periods 23-32). This period range includes the P31 spike and the more recent demand stabilization, providing a more responsive mu_hat and sigma_hat for the OR engine than the global average. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; demand spike of 154 units at Period 31 confirms potential for significant deviations from the recent mean of ~107.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high degree of volatility following a major spike of 154 units in Period 31. This was followed by more moderate demands (90, 87), bringing the mean of the last 10 periods to approximately 106. However, given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1 (95th percentile service level target), we must account for the recent variance to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To balance the risk of another spike against the holding cost, I will use a recent window of N=10 to calculate both mean and sigma. This N aligns with the regime observed since approximately Period 21-24, ensuring we capture current volatility while tempering the impact of the isolated extreme spike in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 20 periods (P15-P34), but with a notable spike of 154 units at Period 31. Excluding that spike, demand has been softer (80-90 units) in the most recent three periods. However, to maintain a safe service level (profit/cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting an 80% target), I will use a recent window that captures the higher volatility observed since Period 31. I'll use N=5 for mu_hat to average the spike (154) with the recent lower values (90, 87, 80) and the period before the spike (111), resulting in a mean of 104.4. Lead time 'L' remains the promised 0 since arrivals are consistently same-period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated following the P31 spike; trailing 5-period mean is ~104 vs previous 20-period mean of ~107.

Daily Reward (R_t): $445.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, specifically with a large spike in Period 31 (154 units) followed by a period of lower demand (80-90 units) and then a return to near-mean levels (115 in Period 35). The mean demand since the major regime shift in Period 11 is approximately 105.5 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1, implying a critical ratio of 0.8), we want to maintain a healthy service level to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 11, 12, 14, 23, and 31. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the recent volatility and the longer-term mean since the P11 shift, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=25 (covering the stable regime since P11) to capture the true mean, but will use a smaller N for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last 5 periods (P31-P35).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows continued high volatility. After the significant spike in Period 31 (154 units), demand settled into a slightly higher range (80-128 units). The trailing 6-period mean (P31-P36) is approximately 109 units, which is consistent with the confirmed regime from Period 11, though with increased variance. With profit=$4.0 and holding cost=$1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a safety stock that buffers against this higher volatility to prevent stockouts like those seen in P31. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=15) to capture the current demand regime's mean and variability while excluding the very early outliers.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains characterized by high variance with a recent mean of approximately 107 units. The last five periods (P33-P37) show demands of [87, 80, 115, 128, 97], resulting in a recent mean of 101.4, while the larger post-P11 regime remains around 107. The spike of 154 units in P31 highlights the need for a robust safety stock, which the OR backend's 80% service level target (based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) aims to provide. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period), so L is set to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable long-term mean and variance of the current regime that started around Period 11, ensuring we don't overreact to the small dip in the last few periods while still accounting for the significant P31 volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime established around Period 11, with a mean of approximately 107 units. While Period 31 saw a high spike (154), subsequent periods (P32-P38) have returned to a more stable range [79, 128], yielding a recent mean of approximately 100 over the last 7 periods. However, the 20-period mean (P19-P38) is 102.8, indicating the 107 baseline remains a robust target for mu_hat to avoid stockouts during moderate volatility. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods across all 38 concluded periods. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established stability while accounting for the recent variability, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the 107-unit average plus a safety buffer for occasional spikes like Period 31.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized somewhat after the Period 31 volatility. The last three periods (P37-P39) show a lower mean demand of 85 units (97, 79, 79) compared to the previous 20-period average of ~107. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a safety buffer against intermittent spikes like P31, I will use a recent window of 10 periods (P30-P39). This window captures the P31 spike (154) which ensures sigma_hat remains high enough to cover volatility, while allowing mu_hat to adjust to the more recent moderate demand levels. Specifically, the mean of the last 10 samples is 102.1 units and the standard deviation is approximately 23.3. Both mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using this recent regime to balance service levels and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $457.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows continued high volatility. While the 20-period mean (P21-P40) is approximately 101 units, recent demands have fluctuated significantly (154 in P31 down to 79 in P39, then up to 116 in P40). The current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Lead time consistency remains at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level (avg ~97) while using a wider window (recent_N=20) for sigma_hat to adequately capture the volatility observed since the P31 spike. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the current mean and the potential for large demand swings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a fluctuating pattern around a mean of approximately 107-110 units. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P32-P41) have a mean demand of 99.3 units, but if we look at the last 6 periods since the volatility stabilized (P36-P41), the mean is 103 units. Stockouts occurred recently at P31 and inventory was very low (1 unit) at P41. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (e.g., P41 conclude) show an actual lead time of 0 periods, which I will continue to use. To balance the relatively high holding cost ($1) against profit ($4) and manage the recent high demand spikes (like 154 and 119), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current regime's average demand while maintaining a buffer for volatility. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to ensure the base stock calculation reflects recent variance levels, protecting against stockouts during spikes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 36-42) indicates a stable but slightly higher demand regime than previous averages, with the last 7 periods showing a mean of approximately 106 units (128, 97, 79, 79, 116, 119, 114). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as indicated by the conclude messages (ordered and arrived in the same period). On-hand inventory is currently very low (1 unit). Given the critical shortage and the need to cover the current period's demand (L=0, so coverage required for 1 period), I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) using a recent window of 7 periods to reflect the current stability and sigma_hat to capture the observed volatility. Using N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced estimate of recent behavior following the P35 volatility mentioned in carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime has stabilized post-P31 spike; trailing 7-period mean is ~106 units with consistent 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the significant spike at Period 31. Over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of 19.4. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the backend's target service level is 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 39 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable regime while providing enough sample size to estimate volatility accurately. This method ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer to handle the observed variance, minimizing stockouts that occurred earlier in the game.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the high-variance event in Period 31. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is approximately 100.7 units with a standard deviation of about 18.5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 45, I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 10 periods to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the expected 101 units plus a safety buffer for the current volatility (z* approx 0.84 for a critical ratio of 0.8), while the internal cap protects against over-ordering.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable following the period 31 spike. Over the last 14 periods (P32-P45), the mean demand is approximately 101.4 units, with a slight upward trend in the most recent 5 periods (P41-P45) where the mean is 105 units. Comparison with the Carry-over Insight from Period 43 shows demand is consistently around the 101-106 range. Actual lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level (given the profit/holding ratio of 4:1, suggesting an 80% service level target) and adapt to the minor recent uptick while respecting the mid-term stability, I am setting mu_hat using the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the post-spike regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time is set to default (0).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady following the high-variance incident in Period 31. Over the last 10 periods (P37\u2013P46), mean demand is approximately 100.1 units. Over the last 5 periods (P42\u2013P46), it is 102.2 units. The 0-period lead time remains consistent, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To accurately capture this stable yet slightly fluctuating demand while maintaining a high service level (given the profit-to-holding cost ratio), I will use the last 10 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N=10 window provides a balanced estimate that incorporates recent behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations observed in the mid-40s periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in the long term, but recent periods show consistent volatility. The trailing 7-period mean (P41-P47) is approximately 110.3 units. In Period 47, demand (122) exceeded on-hand inventory (113), resulting in a stockout. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high criticality (profit $4 vs holding cost $1) and recent stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level (~80% safety factor) while responding to the immediate regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand remains volatile with a trailing 7-period mean of ~110 units; stockout occurred in Period 47 due to demand of 122 vs 113 on-hand.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but relatively stable regime. Over the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48), the mean demand is 105.3, which aligns with the 'Period 43' carry-over insight of ~106 units. However, Period 47 saw a spike of 122 units, leading to a stockout, and Period 48 demand was 106. The current on-hand inventory is low (13 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts from similar spikes while minimizing holding costs, I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the high volatility observed (range of 79 to 122 in the last 10 periods) better than a long-term average, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $467.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P41-P49) shows a mean of approximately 109 units (119, 114, 83, 106, 103, 105, 122, 106, 117). The product 'chips(Regular)' has a high critical ratio (4.0 / (4.0 + 1.0) = 0.8), meaning the system should favor higher service levels to avoid stockouts, which have occurred twice in the last 20 periods (P31, P47). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the current stabilized but slightly higher demand trend compared to the long-term average, I will use recent_N with N=9 to align with the post-P40 performance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest volatility and mean without being skewed by the very early lower-demand periods or the isolated P31 outlier (154).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P40: 9-period mean is ~109 units (P41-P49) compared to the previous ~107; lead time remains strictly 0.
