Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no historical lead time tracking or arrivals, so we follow the promised lead time of 0 periods. The initial demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows 5 samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean demand is 111.4 units and the standard deviation is approximately 17.1. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (0+1) period, and sigma_hat should reflect the volatility over (0+1) period. Using 'default' methods will correctly utilize these historical statistics (111.4 and 17.1 respectively) as our baseline until new observations arrive.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units and they arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0. Demand for Period 1 was 108, which aligns with the provided historical demand average of ~111.4. Current on-hand inventory is 19 units. Since L=0, we need to cover the demand for the current period (N=2) with our decision. Given the history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108], the average demand is approximately 110.8. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on all available data, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or seasonality change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus recent period demands (Period 1: 108, Period 2: 74) shows a mean demand of approximately 105.5 units. The demand in Period 2 (74) was notably lower than previous samples, but there is not yet enough evidence of a sustained downward shift. Since the lead time is 0, the inventory calculation focuses on satisfying current period demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to confirm the 0-period trend and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history, as two recent periods do not constitute a confirmed regime change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders arrive within the same period). Demand for the first five historical samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] averages ~111.4. The actual demand observed during the first three game periods has been 108, 74, and 119, showing a slight decrease compared to the pre-game samples but remaining within a similar range (average of all 8 data points: 107). Inventory is currently very low (4 units on-hand). Since L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock level to cover Period 4 demand. I will use the default method for L to utilize the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to include both recent game observations and the pre-game history, smoothing out the volatility observed in Period 2 while ensuring enough stock to cover the high demand seen in Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-4 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand across the 5 provided samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from 'Past demands') and the 4 observed game periods [108, 74, 119, 124] indicates a mean of approximately 109 units per period. I will use the 'default' lead time of 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the actual game performance heavily. This setup (L=0) allows the base-stock policy to target coverage for the current period's demand immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51] during periods 1-5. The average demand across all 10 available data points is approximately 103.3. However, demand dropped significantly in Period 5 to 51 units. Given this recent drop but higher historical average, I will use a recent window (N=5) for the mean to stay responsive to current fluctuations while maintaining enough samples to account for variance. The backend will calculate base_stock based on the critical ratio: Profit ($4) / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.80 service level. With L=0, the target inventory is set to cover the upcoming period's demand. I'll use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to balance recent trends with statistical stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 6 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand shows significant variability: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] from pre-game, and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67] from game history. Recent demand (Periods 5-6) is notably lower than the historical average (~59 vs ~100). However, 2 periods are insufficient to confirm a sustained regime shift. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the full game history while discounting the pre-game samples slightly to adapt to the lower recent demand. L is set to default (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent 6 periods to balance the high variance seen in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 7 periods shows fluctuations between 51 and 124, with a recent mean of approximately 92.2 and a standard deviation of 27.6. The five periods of pre-game history (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) averaged roughly 111. Combining all observations, there is no significant regime shift yet, though recent demand (Periods 5-7) has been slightly lower (avg 73.6) than previous periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand characteristics across both pre-game and early-game periods, providing enough data to stabilize the mean and variance. The OR engine will set a base stock level that targets a service level of 80% (Profit/(Profit+Holding) = 4/5), while the cap will protect against over-ordering based on the calculated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $337.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 92.25 (108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92) with a standard deviation around 26. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent arrival data from Periods 1-8 confirms the actual lead time L=0 (same-period arrival). There are no missing shipments or overdue orders. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the current demand volatility and mean accurately, as the demand fluctuates between roughly 50 and 125 units without a clear structural break or seasonal trend yet visible in the period markers. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods will allow the OR backend to maintain a base stock level that covers the expected 90-100 units of demand while accounting for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 9 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows no significant trend or seasonality, fluctuating between 51 and 124 units. The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 93.1 units, while the very recent 5-period average is 82.6 units. Given the high profitability ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is high (q=0.8). I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture the overall volatility while remaining responsive to the current stable demand regime. L is set to default (0) as it is reliable. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 9 periods of data to encompass the full range of observed variability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 35. Historical data shows that the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P10 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand over the last 10 periods has fluctuated between 51 and 124, with no clear seasonal trend or shift in the mean (avg ~91.7, std ~22.6). Since lead time is consistently 0, my lookahead period is (1+L) = 1. I will use a larger sample size (N=10) to calculate parameters, as the demand appears to be a stable but slightly noisy regime. The base stock policy will naturally order enough to cover the estimated demand for the next period while accounting for current stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. This yields a critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.84. Looking at the history (Periods 1-11), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the last 11 periods has been slightly volatile but relatively stable with no clear regime shift (Avg: 94.5, Min: 51, Max: 124). In Period 11, we stocked out with demand of 122 exceeding available inventory of 112. Since lead time is 0, we can satisfy demand immediately within the period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the full recent history of the SKU's behavior since the start of the simulation, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects current variability while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 0.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility recently, with the last two periods (P11 and P12) resulting in stockouts (demands of 122 and 119 vs. supply of 112 and 115). The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 96.5 units, but the most recent 5-period average is higher at 102.4 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, the strategy is to ensure enough on-hand inventory is ordered at the start of the period to cover that period's demand. To prevent further stockouts, I am using a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent mean and applying an explicit mu_hat of 115 (just above the recent average) and a slightly higher sigma_hat explicitly set to 25 to protect against the demand spikes seen in periods 3, 4, 11, and 12.

Carry-over insight: Stockouts occurred in Period 11 and 12 due to demand spikes exceeding available inventory; lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 13 consecutive periods of data. Demand has shown recent volatility with significant spikes in Periods 11 (122 units) and 12 (119 units), leading to previous stockouts. Although Period 13 demand moderated to 102 units, the average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13: 100, 79, 122, 119, 102) is 104.4, which is higher than the overall historical mean. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this recent higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is optimal to maintain a higher base stock level to cover these potential demand spikes. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased variance observed in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted around Period 11: increased volatility and mean demand (last 5 periods avg ~104 vs initial ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we experienced a stockout because demand (128) exceeded starting inventory (119). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14) shows an average of 110 units (79, 122, 119, 102, 128), which is a significant increase from the earlier regime. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this higher-demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent upward shift in both demand volume and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand for the last 5 periods has increased to 110 units, compared to the previous average of ~100. Volatility has also increased, contributing to stockouts in Periods 11, 12, and 14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a continued demand regime shift. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) is 116.6 units ([122, 119, 102, 128, 112]), which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. Furthermore, stockouts occurred in three of the last five periods (P11, P12, P14), indicating that current inventory levels are insufficient to handle this new demand level and its increased volatility. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to calculate base stock levels using the higher mean and standard deviation from the current regime, ensuring better availability while the backend's critical ratio (q = 4/5 = 0.8) balances the holding cost against the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has increased to ~117 units, compared to the previous ~100 average. High volatility continues to cause stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift towards higher levels and volatility starting around Period 11. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand units were [122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79], averaging approximately 110 units, which is higher than the initial phase average of ~100. Despite a drop to 79 in Period 16, the preceding five periods were consistently high, resulting in several stockouts (P11, P12, P14). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met across all 16 concluded periods. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing out the most recent low data point, ensuring we maintain a sufficient service level to avoid the recurring stockouts observed in the last few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand history indicates a sustained shift starting around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), demand has averaged 110.1 units (including stockout estimates where demand > sales), compared to the earlier average of ~96. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P13-P17) show a mean of 106 and continued high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To prevent recurrent stockouts observed in P11, P12, and P14, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the higher mean and variance of this new regime. This will help the OR backend set a more robust base stock level to handle spikes while the pipeline inventory remains zero due to L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand since Period 11 is approximately 110 units with elevated volatility, requiring a focus on more recent history (N=7) for parameter estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 11, moving from an initial average of ~100 to a higher, more volatile mean. For the most recent 8 periods (Period 11-18), demand has averaged 105.88 units, with significant spikes causing stockouts in Periods 11, 12, and 14. Although the last three periods (16, 17, 18) show slightly lower demand (79, 109, 76), the overall volatility in this new regime remains high. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend targets an 80% service level. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation, ensuring that mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this post-Period 11 behavior. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher average and continued volatility since Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 9 periods (P11-P19) is approximately 107.7 units, compared to the earlier periods which averaged around 95 units. We recently observed a spike in Period 19 (122 units) which left only 1 unit of ending inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and prevent stockouts like those seen in P11, P12, and P14, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture this established higher-demand regime while filtering out long-term historical lows. L is set to default as the lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 11 confirmed: average demand sustained at ~108 units with periodic spikes exceeding 120 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit the demand regime shift that began around Period 11. Over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the average demand is approximately 106.8 units (122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109, 76, 122, 99), which is higher than the initial average of ~100. However, the most recent demand (P20) was 99, and the last 5 periods show a mix of high and lower values. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's mean and volatility while balancing service level against the $1.0 holding cost (vs $4.0 profit), I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the stabilized post-shift behavior since Period 11.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 11, moving from an initial average of ~100 to a higher average with increased volatility. Since Period 11 (the last 11 periods), demand has averaged approximately 107.5 units, with several peaks exceeding 120 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher demand level while accounting for the recent stability (averaging ~100 in the last 3 periods P19-P21), I am setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This includes the entire current regime starting from the Period 11 shift, providing a robust estimate for the base stock calculation while the OR engine targets a high service level (0.8 quantile) due to the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a higher level than the initial data (pre-P11 mean ~91, post-P11 mean ~103), with significant volatility causing stockouts in Periods 11, 12, and 14. Although the last few periods (P20-P22) have shown slightly lower demand (99, 95, 83), the overall regime since Period 11 remains the most relevant for capturing the current demand environment. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the data since the Period 11 shift, ensuring the backend captures both the higher average and the higher variance observed in this period. The lead time is confirmed as 0; using 'default' (promised lead time 0) is optimal here to ensure same-period delivery is correctly accounted for in the replenishment logic.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified around Period 11. Over the last 13 periods (P11-P23), the average demand is approximately 107.4 units, which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. Despite this elevated average, the demand remains highly volatile, as seen in Period 23 where demand spiked to 131 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 119, ending inventory 0). The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To account for this higher mean and continued volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture the entirety of this persistent regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N with N=13 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the increased standard deviation observed in this period, thereby mitigating the risk of future stockouts during high-demand spikes.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-mean regime since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 106.6 units (calculated from Period 11 to 24). There is periodic high volatility, as seen in Period 23 where demand (131) exceeded starting on-hand inventory, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To capture the current regime while remaining responsive to these recurring demand spikes, I will use a window of the last 14 periods (N=14, starting from the detected changepoint at Period 11). This window provides a balanced estimate of the current mean (~106) and the increased variance. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 0. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 106.6 mean plus a safety buffer derived from the recent volatility, maximizing profit while managing holding costs.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 16-25 shows a series of values: [79, 109, 76, 122, 99, 95, 83, 131, 96, 89]. The mean of these 10 periods is 97.9, while the mean of the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 98.8. Although previous insights suggested a shift to ~108-110 units at Period 11, the most recent 10-period window indicates a slight softening or stabilization around an average of ~99 units. However, volatility remains significant (std dev ~17.5 in the last 10 periods), leading to a stockout as recently as Period 23. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized yet volatile regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated risk of spikes while acknowledging the slight reduction in the mean compared to the peak observed around Period 15-20.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 101.5 units over the last 15 periods (P12-P26), following a period of higher volatility between Periods 11-15. Most recently, the last 7 periods (P20-P26) have averaged 97.7 units, showing a slight cooling down from the previous spike, though a significant stockout occurred in Period 23 (demand 131). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. Given the critical 4:1 Profit-to-Holding ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the optimal service level is 80%. Setting N=15 for mu_hat captured the post-shift average effectively while smoothing the noise, and N=15 for sigma_hat provides a robust estimate of the volatility that caused previous stockouts, ensuring the base stock level (approximately 120-125 units) is sufficient to cover spikes like Period 23 without excessive holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized around a mean of 105 units. However, consistent stockouts in periods like 11, 12, 14, and 23 highlight that demand spikes (e.g., 122, 119, 128, 131 units) frequently outstrip slightly under-provisioned stock levels. Given a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80 suggests we should lean toward satisfying more demand. Stock levels (ending inventory) have been dangerously low (4 units in P27). I will use a recent window (N=17, covering P11 to P27) to capture this higher mean and volatility environment more accurately than the full history, ensuring the OR backend targets the appropriate base stock for the current period's demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $426.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 11 to Period 28 shows a sustained mean of approximately 104 units with periodic spikes exceeding 120 units (e.g., P23 at 131, P19 at 122). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To capture the current demand regime which stabilized around Period 11, I am using a recent_N approach with N=18 (the length of the current regime from P11 to P28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and volatility observed in this phase compared to the initial periods. By setting L to 'calculate', I allow the backend to use the observed history of 0-period lead times, which provides high responsiveness for this same-period arrival SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-28 has a mean of ~104 units with higher volatility (max 131) compared to the initial 10 periods (mean ~93). Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 104 units since Period 11, following an initial period of lower demand. Recent history (P25-P29) shows a mean of 100.4 units with consistent variability. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To capture the current demand regime efficiently while maintaining responsiveness to the documented volatility, I am using a recent_N of 19 (Period 11 to present) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire second demand regime identified in the carry-over insights. Maintaining a 1-period coverage (L=0 + review period) with these settings should balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost while mitigating stockout risks seen in earlier periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has been consistently higher and more volatile than the initial period, with a mean of approximately 104 units and spikes reaching up to 131 units. The most recent demand (P28-P30) shows a slight upward trend (109, 110, 111). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the sustained higher demand and ensure sufficient stock to cover potential spikes (avoiding stockouts like those in P11, P12, P14, and P23), I'm using recent_N with N=20 to capture this stable yet elevated regime. This balances the need for recent accuracy while maintaining enough data points to estimate variance correctly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we observed a significant demand spike of 154 units, the highest in the history of the game, resulting in a stockout. This spike indicates a potential new demand regime or at least an increase in localized volatility which requires a more responsive parameter set. Current on-hand is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning the order placed this period arrives effectively immediately to meet Period 32 demand. Given the stockout and the recent high demand (avg of last 5 periods \u2248 119), I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the higher mean and variance seen in the latter half of the game (since Period 22). This allows \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the recent upwards trend and volatility better than a full-history 'default' method, which would under-order by including the lower demand from the first 10 periods (avg ~93).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Significant demand peak of 154 units observed, the highest recorded, leading to a complete stockout. This suggests sustained high volatility or a new upward demand shift.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we observed a record high demand of 154 units, resulting in a stockout. Period 32 demand returned to a more moderate 90 units, leaving 37 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current demand regime (since Period 11) averages approximately 104 units, but with significantly increased volatility as evidenced by the Period 31 peak. To ensure the base-stock level accounts for this higher volatility and prevents future stockouts while managing the $1.00 holding cost, I will continue to focus on the recent history since the Period 11 shift. Choosing N=22 (Periods 11-32) captures this more volatile regime accurately. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against holding costs, likely increasing the safety stock buffer due to the recent outlier.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant spike in Period 31 (154 units), with the last 5 periods (P29-33) averaging 110.4 units. This is higher than the long-term historical mean of ~102. Given the previous stockout at P31 and the higher mean since P11, I will use recent_N with N=10 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the recent spike and the established higher demand regime (avg ~107 over the last 10 periods) while maintaining responsiveness to current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to calculated based on historical performance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained regime shift since Period 11, with a recent major outlier of 154 units in Period 31. This peak caused a stockout and indicated higher volatility than the earlier periods. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the mean demand is 104.4, but including the spike in P31, the volatility remains a concern. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be verified by consistent same-period arrivals. To balance the risk of stockouts during spikes against holding costs, I am using a recent window of N=10 samples (back to Period 25) to capture the current mean and heightened volatility while smoothing the extreme P31 outlier. This period starts with 42 units on-hand, no in-transit, and a goal to provide enough buffer for potential late-period spikes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to display significant volatility and regime instability. Following the record peak of 154 units in Period 31, demand has fluctuated (90, 87, 80, 115). Starting Period 36 with only 7 units on hand and 0 in-transit requires a robust replenishment. While the long-term average (P1-P35) is roughly 100, the period since the major regime shift in Period 11 (P11-P35) averages 105. However, due to the high volatility seen recently (std dev ~17-20), I will use a shorter window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture recent dynamics (avg ~97) and sigma_hat to reflect high volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to protect against spikes while acknowledging the current on-hand deficit. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with a confirmed mean increase starting around Period 11. Recent demand history shows significant fluctuations (e.g., 154 in P31, 80 in P34, 128 in P36). The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Since the lead time is stable at 0 periods, the objective is to set a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand while accounting for this high variance to prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently (P11, P12, P14, P23, P31). I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (Periods 27-36) which has a mean of approximately 107.4 units. This approach balances the need for a reactive forecast with the statistical stability required to set a safe inventory level against the observed volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase in mean and volatility since approximately Period 11, with recent periods (P31-P37) averaging 107.3 units. A significant peak of 154 units in Period 31 suggests that while the mean is around 104-110, the upper tail is quite high. Current on-hand inventory is 31 units. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To capture the current regime while accounting for recent high-demand events and ensuring enough safety stock to prevent stockouts (which have occurred frequently when inventory was low), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the window from the P31 spike to the present, centering the forecast on the current elevated mean (approx 107) and higher observed variance, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained higher mean and significant volatility since Period 11, with a notable peak of 154 units in Period 31. Over the last 8 periods (P31-P38), the average demand is approximately 104 units, but including the spike and recent variability suggests we should focus on a recent window to capture the current regime. Profit ($4.0) vs Holding Cost ($1.0) implies a target service level of 80% (q = 4/5). Given the stable lead time of 0 periods, I will set L to 'default' (promised lead time 0). To account for the higher mean and intermittent spikes observed since Period 11, I will use a recent window (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility and the shift from the initial lower-demand regime (Periods 1-10).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P31-P39) shows significant volatility, including a peak of 154 units in Period 31 and a more recent drop to around 79 units in Periods 38-39. While the average over the last 9 periods is approximately 101 units, the high variance (std dev ~25) and the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio justify a service level near 80%. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture both the sustained high-demand regime since Period 11 and the high volatility observed recently, I am setting L to 'calculate' (0) and mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to cover the most recent behavior while including the P31 spike to ensure adequate safety stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the higher-mean, high-volatility regime identified around Period 11, with recent demand including a significant peak of 154 units in Period 31 and recent fluctuations between 79 and 116. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is approximately 101.9 units, but the high standard deviation (approx 23.4) and the risk of stockouts (as seen in P31) necessitate a responsive strategy. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current mean and volatility while remaining sensitive to the identified regime shift. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Setting L to default (0) and targeting the last 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock (approx. mean + 1.28*std for a 80% critical ratio) to mitigate stockout risks without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $471.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained increase and higher volatility since Period 11, with recent periods (P32-P41) averaging approximately 104 units and a peak of 154 units in Period 31. The current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units). Given that the backend uses a base stock policy (z-score approximately 0.84 for $4 profit and $1 holding cost), and lead time is consistently 0 periods, the system calculates the order to reach a target inventory level. To capture the current higher-demand regime and protect against high-volatility spikes like those seen in P31, P36, and P41, I am using recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the most representative recent history while providing enough data to estimate the elevated variance correctly.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 101 units over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), with demand fluctuating between 79 and 128 units. While earlier periods (P11-P31) showed higher spikes and a slightly higher average, the most recent 10 periods have stabilized somewhat, though volatility remains present. The lead time is confirmed to be stable at 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.8), I am using a recent window of N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the most current demand regime while providing a realistic estimate of volatility to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 31. This choice balances the risk of running out of stock against the holding cost for ending inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the regime shift identified around Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 104-108 units and significant volatility. Recently, demand has fluctuated between 79 and 119 units since the peak in Period 31. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture the current behavior and account for the recent variance while avoiding excessive holding costs, I will use a recent history of N=13 periods (from Period 31 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window covers the high-demand outlier at Period 31 and the subsequent stabilization. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a shifted mean and high volatility compared to the initial periods. Since Period 11, the mean demand has stabilized around 104-108 units, but recent spikes (e.g., 154 units in Period 31) and fluctuations (recent periods ranging from 79 to 119) necessitate a balanced estimation window. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the current demand regime while smoothing out recent noise, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=14 (covering roughly the last 2 weeks of history) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window is wide enough to capture the elevated variance seen in this regime while remaining responsive to the current average demand level of approximately 101 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 41-45) shows a mean of approximately 109 units (119, 114, 83, 106, 103). The overall demand regime since the major shift identified around Period 11 remains stable with a mean slightly over 100 units but characterized by high volatility (e.g., the peak of 154 in P31). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this sustained higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to potential recent downward fluctuations, I will use a recent_N window of 14 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the period from P32 to P45, capturing the aftermath of the P31 spike and the subsequent stabilization around 104-105 units. Using N=14 provides a balance between detecting the established mean and protecting against volatility without overreacting to individual low-demand periods like P43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $411.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in its second regime (post-Period 11), with a mean demand of approximately 104-108 units. The most recent history (Periods 40-46) shows demands of [116, 119, 114, 83, 106, 103, 105], averaging ~106.6 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the slightly higher volatility noted in historical carry-over insights (spikes up to 154) and the current on-hand inventory of 9 units, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15. This window captures the steady state of the current regime while incorporating enough variance to maintain a safe service level for this high-margin item (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we experienced a stockout because demand (122) slightly exceeded our starting inventory (114), resulting in 0 units on-hand. The current demand regime, which shifted around Period 11 and was highlighted in carry-over insights, continues to show a mean demand of approximately 105-110 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~20). Reviewing the most recent 16 periods (since Period 32 when the 154-unit peak occurred), the average demand is 104.5 units. To ensure sufficient coverage and recover from the stockout, I am using recent_N (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained volatility and mean. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods. These parameters will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock level that targets an 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), helping to prevent further stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in the higher-mean regime established around Period 11. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 105.3 units. However, recent periods (specifically P47 with 122 units) indicate that spikes are still frequent, and a stockout occurred in Period 47 despite reaching capacity. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend's target service level is 80%. Since lead time is 0, the total exposure period (L+1) is 1. I will use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while remaining responsive to the persistent fluctuations that have caused recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $467.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained higher mean and volatility since the shift around Period 11, with recent demand (P45-P49) averaging 110.6 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. However, frequent stockouts (e.g., P47) indicate that the current base-stock levels are slightly too thin to handle volatility. To ensure higher service levels and minimize stockouts during this period of high demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean of 110.1 units, and set sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods (N=20) to better capture the significant variability (including the P31 peak). This balanced approach helps the OR logic maintain sufficient safety stock while acknowledging the 0-period lead time.
