Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 inventory for 'chips(Regular)'. The product is a high-volume snack item. Historical data (last 5 units) shows demand of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], giving a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.9. Given the promised lead time (L=0) and high profit margin compared to holding cost (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), the OR engine should prioritize service level. Since L=0, orders are expected to arrive within the same period they are placed. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline historical statistics, as there aren't enough samples yet to justify a recent_N regime shift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0 periods (order arrived and was available for Period 1 demand). Starting inventory was 127, demand was 107, leaving 20 units on hand. Past demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the most recent demand of 107 gives an average of approximately 110.6. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet, so I will use 'default' for lead time (0) and 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples including Period 1) for demand and volatility to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately. The OR backend will calculate base_stock for L=0 (1 period of demand) and use the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) to set the service level (0.80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we analyze the 'chips(Regular)' performance over the first two periods. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (P1 and P2) confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand in P1 was 107 and in P2 was 116, aligning with the pre-game sample mean of approximately 111.4 (samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94). Currently, on-hand inventory is 9 and in-transit is 0. Since the lead time is effectively 0, the base-stock policy targets the next period's demand (L+1=1). I will use the 'default' method for L as 0 is confirmed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all available data (5 historical + 2 observed = 7 samples) to maintain a stable estimate of demand requirements, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to cover the expected demand (~111-112 units) while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), which naturally pushes the service level towards 80% (q = 4/(4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand over the first three periods has been 107, 116, and 64, with an additional 5 historical samples provided [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the mean of all 8 available samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64) results in a mean of approximately 105.5. The recent demand in Period 3 (64) was significantly lower than average, but with only one such data point, it is too early to declare a regime shift. I will use 'default' for L (0) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility while maintaining a stable average. This approach balances the risk of a downward trend with the need to maintain stock for the historical average demand of ~100+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (including pre-game data) has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the recent game-play demand for P1-P4 was [107, 116, 64, 92]. The average demand is approximately 104 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 35 units on-hand with 0 in transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent regime while smoothing out the drop seen in Period 3. For lead time, I will stick with the 'default' (promised = 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the history of the 'chips(Regular)' SKU which has shown a stable demand pattern over the first 5 periods. The demand observations are [107, 116, 64, 92, 88]. When combined with the pre-period data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall mean is approximately 102 units per period with a standard deviation of 19.8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Periods 1-5 all arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since there are no seasonal dates or product descriptions to suggest a regime shift, I will use all available historical data (N=10 including past demands) to calculate parameters. The profit/holding cost ratio is $4/$1, implying a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 samples ensures we capture both the long-term mean and recent volatility while allowing the OR backend's safety stock logic to handle the inventory buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a decreasing trend over the last 4 periods (116, 64, 92, 88, 84). The mean of all 11 known demand samples is approximately 102.5, but the mean of the most recent 4 periods (excluding the volatile start) is significantly lower at approximately 82. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (arrived same-period), matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for lead time since evidence strongly supports the promised L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: average demand decreased from ~115 (P-4 to P2) to ~82 (P3 to P6), a ~28% reduction. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the system saw a demand of 93, bringing the total inventory to 0 units. The demand history for the last five periods (P3-P7) is [64, 92, 88, 84, 93], with an average of 84.2. This confirms the lower demand regime noted in the carry-over insights (~82-84 units per period). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will continue to use a recent_N approach with N=5 to capture this stable, lower demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to default (0) aligns with the observed lead time. This will ensure we maintain a base stock roughly equivalent to one period of demand (since L=0, base_stock = 1 * mu_hat + safety_stock) while catering to the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout because the demand spiked to 137, significantly exceeding the recent average demand of ~82 observed between Periods 3 and 7. This spike (137) followed by the prior period's 93 suggests the previous 'low demand regime' may have ended or was highly volatile. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will set L to 0. To prevent further stockouts while responding to the recent spike, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend (average of 84, 93, 137 is ~105). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the increased volatility seen in the last several periods. This approach aims to restore service levels after the Period 8 stockout while remaining cautious of the demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 8 (demand 137) after a period of lower demand (P3-P6 avg 82), suggesting the previous downward regime shift may have concluded or was temporary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 47 units. Historical demand shows a period of lower consumption (P3-P6 avg ~82) followed by a sharp spike in P8 (137) and a return to lower levels in P9 (78). The total demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78] (including pre-game data) shows a mean of approximately 101 units. However, the recent 5 periods (P5-P9) average 96 units but with high volatility (standard deviation ~23). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a 0.8 service level target), I will use the last 7 periods (P3-P9) to capture the recent regime shifts and volatility while smoothing the extreme P8 outlier. This range covers both the lower regime and the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast (mu_hat) and capturing current volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against stockouts similar to Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 starts with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 10 (demand of 124 exceeded available 110). Looking at historical demand, there is significant instability. After a low-demand regime (P3-P6 avg: 82), we have seen high volatility in the last four periods (P7-P10 demands: 93, 137, 78, 124). The average of these last four periods is 108, which is closer to the pre-regime shift levels. Given the stockouts in P8 and P10, the priority is to rebuild inventory and accommodate the returning high-demand spikes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-volatility average (108) and using recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in these last four periods. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the P3-P6 low-demand period; the average demand from P7-P10 has returned to ~108 (+32% vs P3-P6). Period 10 confirmed another stockout, justifying higher safety stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $159.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the arrival of all previous orders within the same period. The demand continues to exhibit significant volatility: after a peak of 137 (P8) and 124 (P10), P11 dropped to 58. Analyzing the recent history (P7-P11), the mean demand is approximately 98 with a high standard deviation (approx 33), which is higher than the P3-P6 low-demand period (avg 82). Given the stockouts in P7, P8, and P10, a higher safety stock is necessary to capture potential high-demand spikes (like P8/P10) while current on-hand inventory (73) is moderate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to overweight this high-volatility regime and setting L to 'default' reflecting the consistent 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the demand was 92, and the ending on-hand inventory is 34. Reviewing the demand history from Period 7 to Period 12 (93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92), the mean demand for the last 6 periods is approximately 97. This reflects a return to the higher demand levels seen prior to the P3-P6 dip (avg 82), but with significantly higher volatility (standard deviation > 25). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this volatility and prevent stockouts (which occurred twice recently), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-volatility regime to ensure the OR backend maintains sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significantly elevated from Period 8 onward compared to Periods 1-7. Recent 6-period average (P7-P12) is 97 with a high standard deviation, justifying increased safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 8-13) has shown significant volatility with samples of 137, 78, 124, 58, 92, and 104. This represents a distinct regime compared to the stable lower-demand period (P3-P6). The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 98.8, contrasting with the very low Period 11 demand (58) and high Period 10 demand (124). Stockouts occurred in Period 8 and 10, indicating the need for higher safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent window of N=6 for mu_hat to capture this current volatile regime while avoiding the dilution from the earlier extreme high/low samples. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to properly capture the high recent volatility and ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient safety buffer (z-score for 80% service level based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to show high volatility with mean demand returning to levels above 100 in the most recent periods (P13: 104, P14: 115). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 8, we have seen a demand regime shift characterized by high variance and an average demand around 100 units. To minimize the risk of stockouts while managing holding costs (profit/holding_cost ratio is 4:1), I will use the recent 7 periods (P8 to P14) to calculate both the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This period range (P8-P14) captures the current high-volatility regime and the recent upward trend in demand more accurately than the long-term historical average. Setting N=7 for recent_N allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for these recent peaks (up to 137).

Daily Reward (R_t): $465.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is low (7 units) following three periods of consistent demand (104, 115, 118). Since Period 8, demand has entered a higher volatility regime with frequent stockouts (P7, P8, P10). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture the current demand level while accounting for significant recent volatility, I will use a N=8 period window (matching the period since the volatility shift in P8). This captures the recent average of approximately 103 units while properly weighting the high standard deviation for a sufficient buffer, which is critical given the low current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand volatility regime confirmed from P8 to P15: mean demand approximately 103 units with significantly higher variance compared to P3-P6, requiring higher safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context shows high volatility starting from Period 8. The most recent demand (P16) was low (61), but the preceding periods (P13-P15) showed high demand (104, 115, 118). This fluctuation confirms the high-variance regime previously noted. I am focusing on the demand data from Period 8 onwards (N=9 samples) to capture this volatility while acknowledging the mean has stabilized around ~98 units. Period 16 concluded with 65 units on-hand, which is relatively high due to the lower demand that period. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we should maintain sufficient safety stock to buffer against the observed volatility. Using N=9 for mu_hat captures the current regime's mean, while N=9 for sigma_hat ensures the standard deviation reflects the recent high-variance behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-93.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand dropped drastically to 6 units, which is significantly below the historical average. Combined with the Period 16 demand of 61, we may be entering a lower-demand cycle or experiencing a outlier events. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (117 units). The lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high volatility observed since Period 8 (confirmed in carry-over insights), and the recent sharp drop, I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 focus to the most recent 10 periods (P8-P17) to capture both the high-volatility regime and the recent downward spike, ensuring the OR backend can adjust the base stock appropriately without over-reacting to a single point but acknowledging the shift in trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Potential downward demand regime shift or extreme outlier in Period 17 (demand=6). Previous volatility regime (P8-P16) remains the primary context until more data points confirm a sustained drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand recovered to 87 units from the extreme low of 6 in Period 17, confirming the Period 17 value was likely an outlier rather than a sustained downward regime shift. However, demand volatility remains a significant factor since Period 8. The mean demand for the 'volatile' regime (P8-P18, excluding the P17 outlier) is approximately 98. Including the outlier, the 11-period mean is 89. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, requiring an 80% service level), I will use a window of 11 periods (P8-P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current high-volatility environment while including the recent demand fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 36, and there are no units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 17's demand (6) is confirmed as an outlier as Period 18 returned to 87; the high-volatility demand regime starting Period 8 (avg ~95-100 excluding outliers) remains the guiding context.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows continued volatility. Demand in Period 19 was 43, following an 87 in Period 18 and an outlier of 6 in Period 17. The regime starting from Period 8 remains characterized by high variance and a mean demand slightly lower than the initial baseline but higher than the P3-P6 dip. Excluding the extreme outlier (P17: 6), the average demand from P8 to P19 is approximately 95. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 78 units and demand recently fluctuated significantly (43 to 137), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the high-volatility regime starting at P8. This N effectively covers the shift while accounting for the recent outliers (6 and 43), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the risk of stockouts (seen in P7, P8, P10) against holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21. Demand patterns since Period 8 have shown significant volatility (mean ~90.2 excluding P17 outlier). Recent demand in P19 (43) and P20 (82) suggests a cooling from the previous high volatility regime (P8-P16), but the market remains unpredictable. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize data from the current high-volatility regime (N=13, from P8 to P20) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the recent fluctuations and the outlier in P17 while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer (high sigma) to prevent stockouts like those seen in P7, P8, and P10. The OR engine's critical fractile (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) indicates we should target the 80th percentile of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked to 171, significantly exceeding the previous volatility range and leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms that 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 8, but has intensified recently. The average demand across the last 14 periods (P8-P21) is approximately 98, with significant fluctuations. Given the stockout and the high profit margin ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the priority is to increase service levels to capture these spikes. I will use a N=14 period window (P8-P21) to capture the current volatile regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant regime since Period 8; Period 21 recorded a significant spike (demand=171), the highest in the history, confirming that safety stock must remain high to avoid stockouts during unpredictable peaks.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand dropped to 47 units after the historical peak of 171 in Period 21. This confirms the 'high volatility' regime identified in carry-over insights since Period 8. The mean demand from Period 8 to Period 22 (excluding the extreme Period 17 outlier of 6) is approximately 95.8 units, while the recent 5-period mean (P18-P22) is roughly 86. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high standard deviation in this regime (approx 35-40 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the high-volatility regime starting from Period 8, ensuring the OR backend allocates sufficient safety stock to handle the frequent spikes while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Since Period 8, we have observed a high-volatility demand regime. Recent demand has been extremely irregular: Period 21 saw a historical high of 171, followed by 47 in Period 22 and an abnormally low 12 in Period 23. This mirrors the pattern seen in Period 17 (demand=6). Despite these low outliers, the risk of stockouts during spikes (like P8, P10, and P21) remains high. The current on-hand inventory is 112 units. Given the extreme volatility and the recent low outlier, I will use a recent window (N=16, from Period 8 to Period 23) to capture the current high-variance regime while acknowledging the recent low demand. This balances the need for safety stock against the cost of carrying inventory after low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime continues: Period 21 saw a record high (171) followed by a low outlier in Period 23 (12). This confirms a wide demand distribution where safety stock must be maintained despite occasional low outliers.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which has been the dominant characteristic since Period 8. In the most recent four periods, demand has swung between a record high of 171 (P21) and a sharp low of 12 (P23), with P24 at 56 units. Because the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the system can react quickly. However, the high standard deviation in the recent regime (P8-P24) and the risk of stockouts during spikes (like P21) necessitate a robust sigma_hat. I will use recent_N (N=17, covering the high-volatility regime since Period 8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this wide distribution while ensuring the base stock level remains high enough to buffer against unpredictable spikes without incurring excessive holding costs from the occasional low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with significant spikes (e.g., Period 21: 171) and deep troughs (e.g., Period 23: 12), while the mean remains relatively stable around 95-100 units. Period 25 demand was 59, bringing the on-hand inventory to 60. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all history up to Period 25. Given the high variance observed since Period 8, using a recent window of data is necessary to capture this 'high volatility' regime. I will use N=18 (covering Period 8 to Period 25) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides the OR engine with the correct mean and an appropriately high standard deviation to set a safety stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes, while the 0-period lead time parameter ensures the order arrives in time to meet same-period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, as evidenced by Period 21 (171), Period 23 (12), and most recently Period 26 (132). Period 26 resulted in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since Period 8, we have been in a high-variance regime where the mean is roughly 80-100 but individual outcomes fluctuate drastically between extremes. To protect against frequent stockouts like those in Period 21 and 26 while acknowledging recent lower values (P23-25), I will use the recent_N method with N=19 (covering back to the start of the volatility shift at Period 8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term volatile average against recent outliers. L remains default (0) as all orders continue to arrive same-period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $435.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. Following a stockout in Period 26 (demand 132), Period 27 demand was 111. The demand regime starting at Period 8 shows an average demand of approximately 82 units, but with extremely high variance (range: 6 to 171). Because lead time is consistently 0 periods, the OR backend requires parameters that reflect both the mean and the considerable risk of spikes to maintain service levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the full scope of this high-volatility regime (P8 to P27), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for recent large demand swings like those seen in P21 (171) and P26 (132).

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent stockouts (Periods 21, 26, and 28 out of the last 8 periods). The current period begins with 0 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To address the significant variance and recent demand spikes (171 in P21, 132 in P26, 157 in P28), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 (the length of the high-volatility regime starting at Period 8). This captures the wider distribution and higher mean compared to the earlier quiet periods (P3-P6). The backend's base-stock calculation will use these parameters to generate an order that accounts for both the high average demand and the substantial volatility, aiming to prevent the recurrent stockouts observed in the recent history.

Carry-over insight: Recurring stockouts in Period 21, 26, and 28 confirm the high-volatility regime persists; demand spikes frequently exceed 130 units, requiring elevated safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P29) shows a series of spikes (132, 111, 157, 133) resulting in stockouts in three out of the last four periods. The high-volatility regime identified since Period 8 persists, but current average demand is trending higher than the overall mean. To prevent further stockouts in Period 30, I am using a recent_N window (N=9) to capture the higher mean and elevated volatility seen from Period 21 to Period 29. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, so the base stock level calculated will drive the full order quantity (capped by the backend) to restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has increased again between P26-P29, averaging ~133 units, following a volatile mid-period. This represents a sustained upward shift in demand magnitude alongside high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand was 81, which follows a period of higher activity (P26-P29 mean ~133). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 64. I am maintaining the mu_hat and sigma_hat settings to address the high-volatility regime identified since Period 8, specifically focusing on the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30) which include multiple demand spikes (e.g., 171, 132, 157, 133) and significant stockouts. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the high variance observed recently, ensuring sufficient safety stock to buffer against frequent spikes while reacting to the recent average demand of approximately 106 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and a recent upward shift in magnitude. Period 31 saw a demand of 163, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has averaged approximately 129.5 units, significantly higher than the mid-game average. The current on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, which favors maintaining a healthy safety stock to capture high-demand spikes (like the 171, 157, and 163 recently observed). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this most recent high-demand/high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, so I will continue using the 'default' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme with a sustained upward shift in mean; average demand from P26-P31 is ~130 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 150 units leading to recurring stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and an upward shift in the mean during recent periods. In Period 32, demand dropped to 33 units, following a high of 163 in Period 31 and 81 in Period 30. Looking at the recent regime (P26-P32), the average demand is approximately 115.7 units with a very high standard deviation. Since Period 26, we have experienced stockouts in 4 out of 7 periods (P26, P28, P29, P31), indicating that the current base stock levels are frequently insufficient to handle demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To better capture this high-volatility, higher-mean regime while acknowledging the recent low demand of 33, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to encompass the entire shift starting at Period 26. This allows the OR engine to react to the increased variance and the elevated mean observed over the last week of operations, ensuring a higher safety stock to prevent further lost sales during the frequent 130+ unit surges.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. In recent periods, we've seen significant spikes (P28: 157, P29: 133, P31: 163) interspersed with very low outliers (P32: 33, P33: 5). Despite the recent low demand figures which have left us with 150 units on-hand, the history suggests that demand can rebound to over 150 units instantly. Given the high profit margins ($4) relative to holding costs ($1), a high service level is optimal. The mean demand in the most recent high-activity regime (P26-P31) was approximately 130 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this recent higher-magnitude mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the high volatility seen since Period 26. This allows the OR backend to maintain sufficient buffer for the frequent spikes that cause stockouts, while the current on-hand inventory will naturally moderate the actual order size due to the base-stock calculation logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains bi-modal with extreme spikes (>150) and extreme lows (<10) occurring in close proximity. The operational mean from P26-P31 is ~130, while variance remains high.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues to show extreme bimodal volatility with spikes exceeding 150 units (P31: 163) and deep troughs below 20 (P33: 5, P34: 18). While the carry-over insight noted a mean of ~130 for P26-P31, the subsequent two periods (P33-P34) have seen very low demand, which is typical for this erratic profile. Current on-hand inventory is 132 units. Since the lead time is 0 periods, the current inventory + any order placed today must cover today's demand. Given the propensity for spikes >150, I want to ensure the base stock levels remain high enough to buffer against another immediate spike. I will use the recent_N method with N=9 (covering the period from P26 to P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window captures both the recent upward shift in mean and the extreme variance observed in the most recent regime. L remains 0 (default).

In Period 35, demand surged to 144 units, depleting all on-hand inventory and demonstrating the persistent extreme volatility observed since Period 26. The recent 10-period (P26-P35) average demand is 107.8, but this includes two significant low outliers (5 and 18). Excluding these outliers, the demand frequently spikes above 130-150 units. The lead time remains stable at 0. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and volatility is high with a high critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average to capture the upward shift in mean while using an explicit sigma_hat of 55 to provide sufficient safety stock against the recurring spikes (>150 units) seen in P28, P29, and P31. This strategy aims to prevent stockouts which have occurred in 4 of the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: Period 35 demand (144) confirms the trend of high-magnitude spikes follow low outliers. Safety stock must account for frequent demand >140 units despite lower 10-period averages.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and bi-modal characteristics, with sudden spikes (e.g., 144 in P35) often immediately following periods of relative low demand. Since Period 26, we have observed a mean demand of approximately 115, but with frequent peaks exceeding 140 leading to historical stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 remains consistent. Given the current on-hand inventory of 52 and the tendency for demand to swing sharply upwards (P35 demand was 144, P36 was 92), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 11 (covering roughly Period 26 onwards) to capture the higher mean of the current regime while maintaining high safety stock. sigma_hat will also use recent_N of 11 to reflect the high local variance. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the recurring high-demand spikes (~140-160 units) while the current inventory of 52 is subtracted.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility and bi-modal behavior, characterized by sharp spikes (e.g., 144 units in P35) interspersed with extreme lows (e.g., 32 units in P37, 5 units in P33). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 113 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the optimization goal is to maintain high service levels to capture demand spikes, which have recently peaked at 163-171 units. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=12 (covering Periods 26-37) to capture the higher-magnitude demand regime observed lately (mean ~98, including lows), and I will explicitly set a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance and prevent stockouts during the frequent >140 unit spikes. A sigma_hat of 60 reflects the high observed standard deviation in this volatile regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a suspected bi-modal distribution (high spikes followed by significant lows). Recent demand points are P35: 144, P36: 92, P37: 32, and P38: 100. The mean demand in the current high-volatility regime (since P26) is approximately 104 units, but requires a high safety stock to buffer against frequent spikes >140 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding cost ratio is 4.0, implying a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). To prevent stockouts during the next likely spike while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=13, covering the period since the last major shift around P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variance and volume.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P39) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a wide range, including high spikes (up to 163) and low values (down to 5). The average demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 89, but the median is slightly lower and the variance is extremely high. The 'recent_N' method with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is chosen to capture this high-volatility regime while balancing recent lower demand observations (30, 100, 32) against the potential for recurring large spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 109, which provides a buffer against the next possible spike while the OR engine calculates the necessary replenishment to maintain safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 concluded with a stockout (demand 139, sold 135), leaving 0 on-hand inventory for Period 41. The lead time remains stable at 0. The demand continues to exhibit extreme volatility and bi-modality, with frequent spikes exceeding 130 units (P26: 132, P28: 157, P29: 133, P31: 163, P35: 144, P40: 139) interspersed with significant lows. The average demand since the last major shift (P26 to P40) is approximately 99 units, but the high variance and frequent stockouts necessitate a base stock level that targets at least the 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)). Using a recent_N of 15 periods for both mean and sigma captures this high-variance regime (P26-P40), providing the OR backend with the necessary statistical parameters to recover from the current stockout and buffer against upcoming spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Continued extreme volatility with frequent spikes >130 units and persistent stockout risk (P40 stockout confirmed); demand mean since P26 is ~99 but captures a wide variance regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context (P26-P41) shows a high-volatility regime with an average demand of approximately 100 units, but with frequent extreme spikes (e.g., 163, 139) that lead to stockouts when inventory is low. The most recent demand (P41) was 89. Period 40 saw a stockout after a demand of 139. Given the 0-period lead time, we must maintain a high base stock to cover these unpredictable spikes. I am choosing N=16 (back to P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-variance/high-mean regime while ignoring the earlier lower-demand periods. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover demand spikes exceeding 130-150 units, which have become common in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, characterized by high spikes (e.g., 171, 157, 163, 144) and periodic low outliers (e.g., 5, 18, 30). Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized somewhat around 95-100 units, but the high variance remains the primary operational challenge, leading to frequent stockouts (P35, P40). Period 42 showed a demand of 76, following a demand of 89 in P41. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the ongoing volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs from over-correcting for the low outliers, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=15 (covering P28-P42) to capture the current magnitude of demand spikes. For sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N of 10 to focus on the most recent volatility regime and ensure sufficient safety stock for the backend OR engine to buffer against the frequent 130+ unit spikes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and bi-modal behavior, characterized by frequent spikes and deep troughs. Recent demand (P41-P43: 89, 76, 60) has been relatively stable, but history (P40: 139, P35: 144, P31: 163) shows that massive spikes can occur without warning. The profit margin ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) justifies a service level of approximately 80%, but the frequent stockouts observed in the past (P40, P35, P31, P29, P28, P26) necessitate a more aggressive safety stock buffer to maximize reward. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage this high variance, I will use a recent window of 15 periods (P29-P43) which captures the current high-volatility regime (averaging ~90, but with a range from 5 to 163). This window provides a balanced mu_hat and sigma_hat that accounts for both the recent moderate demand and the persistent risk of spikes.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and bi-modal characteristics. We observed a sell-out in Period 44 (demand 126 vs on-hand 122), following a period of relatively lower but unstable demand. The 'high-volatility' regime identified since Period 8 remains the dominant narrative, with the mean demand since Period 26 (the current operational regime) being approximately 95-100, but with a standard deviation frequently exceeding 50. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's default service level target is roughly 80%. However, due to the frequent spikes >130 units (e.g., P21, P28, P29, P31, P35, P40), and the most recent stockout, I am using a recent_N of 19 (covering back to the Period 26 shift) to capture this higher-magnitude, high-variance behavior. Lead time remains stable at 0. This approach ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated from the most relevant window of high variance to provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment continues to exhibit extreme demand volatility with a bimodal distribution characterized by frequent spikes (e.g., 126 in P44, 139 in P40) and deep troughs. While the mean demand since the P26 upward shift is approximately 95-100, the standard deviation is exceptionally high (approx 50+). Recent stockouts (P40, P44) highlight that the OR backend's service level logic must be primed for these spikes despite lower average demand in the last few periods. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (starting around P31) while smoothing out the most extreme outliers (like the '0' demand periods). This N choice balances the long-term volatility seen since P26 with the most recent behavior, providing enough safety stock to handle spikes above 130 units while minimizing excess holding costs when demand drops.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility bimodal demand regime continues: since P31, demand frequently oscillates between <20 (P33, P34, P39) and >130 (P35, P40, P44). This requires maintaining a high sigma_hat relative to the mean to buffer against frequent stockout risks.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal, high-volatility pattern. Since Period 31, we have seen demand swing between very low (18 units in P46, 30 units in P39) and high (126 units in P44, 139 units in P40). The average demand over the last 15 periods (P32-P46) is approximately 78 units, but the high variance remains the primary operational challenge to avoid stockouts during spikes. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable. With the game ending in Period 50, I will use a recent window (N=16, from P31-P46) to capture this current volatile regime. This window includes multiple spikes and lows, allowing mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current distribution's mean and high uncertainty. By setting a robust sigma_hat, the capped base-stock policy in the OR backend will maintain enough safety stock to protect against the frequent spikes >130 units observed recently.

Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $93.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P46=18, P47=24) continues the extreme bimodal volatility observed since Period 31, where low demand periods are frequently followed by sharp spikes exceeding 130 units (e.g., P31=163, P35=144, P40=139, P44=126). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the stockout risk inherent in this high-variance regime while avoiding excessive holding costs from the recent low-demand cluster, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 periods (P38-P47) to capture the current operational mean (approx 67) while keeping sigma_hat 'explicit' at a high value (65) to account for the frequent 130+ unit surges. This ensures the base stock remains high enough (~180 units) to cover potential spikes occurring in Period 48 or 49.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the SKU experienced its highest historical demand spike of 192, significantly exceeding the previous record of 171 and resulting in a total stockout. This confirms the persisting high-volatility, bimodal demand regime described in the carry-over insights, where extreme spikes follow periods of low demand (P46=18, P47=24). With Period 49 being the second to last period and on-hand inventory at 0, maximizing service level to capture a potential final spike is critical. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=23 (covering the period from the P26 upward shift to present) to capture the higher mean and 'explicit' for sigma_hat set to 60 to account for the extreme 192 outlier and provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: New historical demand record reached in Period 48 (demand=192), confirming that the volatility regime is intensifying with even higher potential spikes than previously observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $556.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we observed a back-to-back demand spike (192 in P48 and 182 in P49), both significantly higher than the previous historical record of 171. This confirms an intensification of the extreme volatility regime. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to these spikes causing stockouts. To maximize profit and reach the necessary service level (q = 0.8), the OR parameters must account for the high mean and extreme standard deviation observed in this recent high-volatility phase. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20), which captures the shift toward higher magnitude spikes and increased variance seen since P30, ensuring the base stock formula accounts for the current risk of frequent spikes exceeding 180 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensification confirmed: P48 (192) and P49 (182) set new historical records, indicating that spikes are becoming more severe. Service level must be prioritized to avoid frequent stockouts during these growing peaks.
