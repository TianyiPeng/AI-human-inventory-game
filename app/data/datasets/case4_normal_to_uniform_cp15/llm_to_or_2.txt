Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.26. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no lead time history yet to suggest deviations, I will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior (1+L = 1 period of demand covered). The OR backend will calculate the base stock and order amount based on these parameters and the given profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that all 127 units arrived within the same period (L=0), satisfying a demand of 107 and leaving 20 units on hand. The historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the new observation (107) shows a relatively stable mean around 110.7. Since L=0, the target base stock needs to cover the demand of the current period. With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a high service level is optimal. I will use the 'default' method for L and sigma_hat to utilize all available history, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (including the latest period) to stay responsive to the current demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, the actual lead time has been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (including pre-game data) shows samples of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116], with a mean of approximately 111.4 and a standard deviation of 14.5. The system currently holds 9 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Since L=0, the review+lead period is (1+L)=1. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing out noise. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (critical ratio q = 0.8), ensuring sufficient stock for the upcoming period's demand.

Daily Profit: $256.00, Daily Holding Cost: $64.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 64 units. Demand history shows variability: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64] (in-game). The Period 3 demand (64) was significantly lower than the average (~106). However, with only 3 in-game samples, I will use a larger window (N=5) including pre-game data to establish a stable mean and variance, avoiding an overreaction to the recent low demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (4 / (4+1)). Standard parameters are suitable here as no significant trend or persistent regime shift is yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), justifying a high service level. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-4), the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand samples so far are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64, 92] (observed). The mean demand of the observed periods is approximately 94.75, which is slightly lower than the pre-game mean (~111.4). Period 3 showed a significant dip (64) which recovered in Period 4 (92). Since the lead time is reliably 0, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the actual game observations more heavily than the pre-game data, as they reflect the current environment more accurately, while still providing some smoothing against the volatility seen in Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a mean of approximately 93.4 units (samples: 107, 116, 64, 92, 88). There is a slight downward trend compared to the pre-game history (mean ~111), specifically since Period 3. The actual lead time consistently confirms as 0 periods (orders placed in P1-P5 arrived within the same period). Given regular demand with moderate volatility, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current mean and standard deviation. This method allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand regime and lead time risk, while the q-ratio (4/5 = 0.8) informs the service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $309.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-6 confirms that actual lead time consistently equals 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (including those in the training set and game history) has shown a slight downward trend compared to the initial training data: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] vs recent [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84]. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 91.8. Given the consistent lead time performance, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent demand regime which appears lower than the seed data and exhibits moderate variability. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent stabilized demand levels while maintaining enough buffer for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) over the last 7 periods (107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93) shows a relatively stable pattern with an average of approximately 92 units per period. The spike in demand at Period 2 and the dip at Period 3 have stabilized into a tighter range (84-93) over the last three periods. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the stabilization of demand after the Period 3 outlier, while maintaining the default lead time of 0. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers immediate demand plus a safety cushion for the current period's volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a complete stockout (demand 137, sold 95, ending on-hand 0). The observed demand has fluctuated significantly, with the pre-history showing values like 138 and recent game history peaking at 137, while Periods 3-6 showed a lull (average ~82). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 8 showed a sharp increase in demand (137) compared to the previous several periods (avg ~90), I need to increase the stock level to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend while balancing it against the lower demand periods, and recent_N with N=8 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility seen throughout the active game periods. Setting L to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean around 100 units/period (P1-P9 mean approx. 95). Period 8 saw a spike to 137, leading to a stockout since on-hand wasn't sufficient, but Period 9 demand dropped back to 78. Current on-hand is 40 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent variability while maintaining a baseline from the stable regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen in the last few periods (88, 84, 93, 137, 78). This balances response to the high-demand outlier in P8 with the return to lower levels in P9, ensuring enough stock to satisfy demand without excessive holding costs for this $1.0 holding cost item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high base-stock target due to its profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost, yielding a critical ratio of 0.8). Historical demand across the last 10 periods averages 98.3, but recent periods (8 and 10) have seen surges (137 and 124) resulting in stockouts. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period from 1 to 10. For Period 11, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the recent higher volatility and mean shifts (Average: 104.2, Std Dev: ~25.9). Setting L to explicit 0 ensures the OR backend targets precisely the next period's needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-11 confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods). Therefore, L=0 is appropriate. Demand over the last 11 periods has shown some volatility but no clear sustained trend (mean \u2248 95). However, including the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the game history [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58], there's a broad distribution. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (N=10 averages ~93.4) while maintaining enough sensitivity to manage the high service level required by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio of 0.8).

The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable but high-volatility demand pattern with an actual lead time consistently at 0 periods (same-period arrival). The promised lead time is 0. Recent demand over 12 periods ranges from 58 to 137, with an average of approximately 95 units per period. In Period 8 and Period 10, stockouts occurred because historical averages didn't account for spikes exceeding 120 units. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method (all history) because the demand appears stationary (no clear regime shifts or seasonality based on neutral period names). This will calculate parameters based on the full 17-sample history (5 past + 12 observed).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent lead time of 0 periods across all 13 observed periods. The demand history shows some fluctuation but no strong seasonal trend in the period numbering; mean demand across the all 18 samples (5 provided + 13 actual) is approximately 100.3. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has been slightly more volatile with values: 78, 124, 58, 92, 104 (mean 91.2). However, given the lost sales in Period 8 and 10, the actual demand might be slightly higher than the 'sold' units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime while smoothing out the recent noise. I am keeping L=0 as calculated, as the lead time remains highly reliable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable with a mean of approximately 97 units across all 14 periods. Detailed focus on the last 5 periods (P10-P14) shows a mean of 98.6. We have consistently observed a lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. However, we stock out occasionally (P8, P10, P14), indicating a need for a slightly higher service level or more responsive parameters. Since the target service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), and we have 0 on-hand inventory starting Period 15, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean while relying on the default lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $469.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 118, following a sequence of 115, 104, 92, and 58. The average demand across all 15 periods is approximately 97 units. Based on the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15), the average demand is slightly lower at 97.4 units, while the recent 3 periods (P13-P15) show a higher average of 112.33 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (3 units on hand). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean while ensuring we have enough stock to meet potential spikes similar to P14 and P15, where demand exceeded 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms a lead time of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 57 units. Analyzing the historical demand from Period 1 to Period 16, the mean demand is approximately 95.8 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. No clear seasonal patterns or regime shifts are evident in the data provided. Therefore, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the 'default' method, which uses all available samples to set a stable base stock level, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 6 units, compared to the historical average of approximately 95. This appears to be a sudden outlier or the start of a new regime. However, given the high ending inventory (113 units) and the consistent 0-period lead time observed across all 17 periods, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the model to adjust to recent fluctuations while still maintaining a reasonable buffer against the historical average. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the first 16 periods (avg units ~95-100), but significant volatility in the most recent two periods (Period 17 demand was 6, Period 18 demand was 87). The historical demand sequence [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] combined with game history [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92, 104, 115, 118, 61, 6, 87] averages approximately 95 units per period. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Due to the sudden extreme drop in Period 17 followed by a recovery in Period 18, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows the model to react to the recent high variance and the lower mean observed in the last three periods (61, 6, 87) compared to the overall average, without overreacting to the single outlier of '6'. Since lead time is zero, L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with the last five periods (P15-P19) showing demands of 118, 61, 6, 87, and 43 respectively. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 80.8, while the overall mean (including the pre-game demands) is approximately 91.5. A significant drop occurred in Period 17 (demand=6), but demand rebounded partially since. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high variability (std dev ~35 recently) and the risk of stockouts seen in P8, P10, and P14, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current mean while allowing the sigma to reflect the high variance to maintain a sufficient service level. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the current period's demand (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable over the first 20 periods with occasional spikes and drops. The mean demand across all 20 periods is 87.8, while the mean of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 55.8, showing a recent downward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a service level around 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the more recent demand variability while smoothing out the extreme low anomaly in Period 17 (demand=6). I will maintain the lead time (L) at the promised default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked to 171, significantly exceeding the recent average and the starting inventory of 107. All 21 observed periods show an actual lead time of 0 (same-period arrival). While demand has fluctuated, the mean remains relatively stable around 95-100 units. The spike in Period 21 (171) is a significant outlier compared to the rest of the history (e.g., Period 17 was only 6). Given the zero lead time and no current on-hand inventory, I need the OR engine to place a substantial order. I will use a larger N (recent_20) for \u03bc\u0302 to smooth out the volatility while acknowledging the higher demand context, and use a similar N for \u03c3\u0302 to capture the high variance seen in recent periods (171 and 6). This approach targets a base stock that covers the expected 100 units plus a safety buffer for the high variance.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 88.2 units over the past 22 periods. However, recent demand has been volatile, with a significant spike of 171 in Period 21 followed by a drop to 47 in Period 22. The on-hand inventory is currently 74 units. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the OR backend uses a service level based on the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0) ratio (q = 4/5 = 0.80), and the current inventory (74) is below the average demand, an order is needed. I will use a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility shifts (like the Period 21 spike) while maintaining a stable average. L is set to default as lead time has remained consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that all orders have consistently arrived within the same period (L=0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent values ranging from as low as 6 to as high as 171. Calculating the mean across the most recent 20 periods (P4-P23) provides a more stable estimate than the full history, especially as the early periods seem to reflect a different startup phase. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 20 periods is approximately 84 units, which I will use for mu_hat. Given the high variance (standard deviation around 40), I will use the recent 20-period standard deviation for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against spikes like those seen in P8, P10, and P21, while the high critical ratio (0.8) naturally favors holding more stock to avoid lost sales.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-24) shows high volatility (171, 47, 12, 56) compared to the earlier, more stable period. Specifically, Period 17 saw 6 demand, Period 21 saw 171, and Period 23 saw 12, indicating a breakdown of the initial steady state (mean ~110-120). Calculating the mean of the last 10 periods (P15-P24) gives an average of approximately 57.7, compared to the overall average including past data (total mean ~86). However, the last 4 periods average 71.5. Given the high volatility but lower recent 'valley' demands, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current lower but erratic demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the spikes observed (e.g., P21). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. The current on-hand inventory is 63, which is close to the recent average demand, necessitating a moderate order to maintain the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 17-24 shows increased volatility and lower average (~60-70) compared to Period 1-16 (~100).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, moving from a stable mean of approximately 100 units to a more volatile state with a lower average. For Period 26, the on-hand inventory is 51. Looking at the last 9 periods (P17-P25), demand values are [6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12, 56, 59]. The mean for this recent window is approximately 62.6, and the standard deviation is significantly higher than the initial phase. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period). To adapt to this current regime, I am choosing 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this shift in both mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the lower average demand while protecting against the observed high-demand spikes (like 171 in P21).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 17-26) continues to show high volatility with extreme values (ranging from 6 to 171) and an average slightly lower than the initial baseline, though recent peaks (132 and 171) suggest the risk of stockouts remains high. In Period 26, demand (132) exceeded starting inventory (104), resulting in a stockout and 0 ending inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To recover and manage the current volatility while acknowledging the carry-over insight of a lower average but high variance, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current regime's behavior. I will also use N=10 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the significant demand spikes observed in this regime, providing a sufficient safety stock buffer given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $442.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown erratic behavior since Period 17, as noted in the Carry-over Insights. While the average dropped initially, recent periods (P26, P27) have shown a return to higher demand levels (132 and 111 respectively). On-hand inventory is currently very low (2 units), and there is no in-transit stock. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true, I will maintain L=0. To capture the recent spike back toward previous levels while acknowledging the high volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 5. This window includes the lower demand of P23-25 (12, 56, 59) and the higher demand of P26-27 (132, 111), resulting in a more balanced but responsive mean and a higher sigma to protect against stockouts during this volatile phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; recent periods (P26-P27) suggest a return to high-demand levels (~120) after a low-demand stretch (P17-P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a high-demand regime over the last three periods (P26: 132, P27: 111, P28: 157), with an average of approximately 133 units. This follows a volatile low-demand stretch (P17-P25). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time remains consistently 0 periods, I must ensure the order covers this new high-demand level plus a safety buffer for the high volatility observed (std dev ~23). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this latest regime, capturing the mean of 133 and the current variance. L is set to 'default' as lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: average demand increased to ~133 (from previous ~63 in P17-P25), with high volatility continuing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another regime shift starting around Period 26. After a low-demand period (P17-P25 avg ~63), the last four periods (P26-P29) show significantly higher demand levels: 132, 111, 157, and 133, averaging approximately 133.25. This justifies using a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Setting mu_hat to reflect this current high mean ensures we stock enough to meet the resurged demand, while the sigma_hat based on the same window accounts for the observed high volatility (range of 111 to 157).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-volume regime starting at Period 26, following a lower-demand stretch between Periods 17 and 25. The last five periods of demand are [132, 111, 157, 133, 81], resulting in an average of 122.8. Although Period 30 saw a dip to 81, the preceding four periods were consistently above 110, indicating a sustained increase compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume, high-volatility regime (average demand ~123, significant variance). Setting L to default (0) as lead times have been perfectly stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 26. Analyzing the high-demand regime from Period 26 to 31, the demands were: 132, 111, 157, 133, 81, and 163. The mean demand for these 6 periods is approximately 129.5, confirming the sustained increase noted in carry-over insights. Total stockouts occurred in Period 31 (ending on-hand 0), and several periods previously (P26, P28), indicating the 'cap' or the base stock calculation is trailing the volatility. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times consistently follow this (L=0), I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should increase the base stock enough to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: current high-demand phase (P26-P31) maintains an average of ~130 with high volatility (range 81-163).

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility. Following a high-demand phase starting at Period 26 (avg ~130), Period 32 showed a significant drop to 33 units. However, given the profit margin (Profit $4.0 vs Holding $1.0, critical ratio ~0.8) and history of spikes (e.g., Period 31 demand was 163), we must maintain a robust base stock. The current on-hand inventory is 123. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the high-volatility regime that began in Period 26. This allows the OR backend to account for the recent demand average and its increased standard deviation while reconciling with the current high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: High volatility regime continues; Period 32 demand (33) is an outlier compared to the P26-P31 average (~130), requiring a balanced approach to avoid stockouts if demand rebounds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with two distinct regimes. After a high-demand phase (P26-P31 avg ~130), demand has dropped significantly over the last two periods (P32: 33, P33: 5). This suggests a possible shift out of the high-demand regime or an extreme temporary trough. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the cost of a stockout is much higher than the cost of carrying inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 150 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately one period of the high-demand regime average (~130) or many periods of the current low-demand observation. To avoid over-ordering during a potential downward shift while still protecting against a rebound to the P26-P31 levels, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the start of the last high-demand phase P26 through P33) to capture the overall volatility and mean of this volatile stretch. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: after a peak of 163 (P31), demand dropped to 33 (P32) and 5 (P33). Ongoing monitoring is required to determine if this is a temporary trough or a new low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility, shifting from a high-demand phase (avg ~130 in P26-P31) to a sudden low-demand stretch (P32-P34: 33, 5, 18). Current on-hand inventory is 133 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent three periods. However, given the product type (chips) and historical patterns, these low numbers may be an outlier or a temporary dip rather than a permanent regime change. Relying strictly on a very small N (e.g., N=3) would result in a mu_hat around 18, which risks stockouts if demand reverts to previous levels. Conversely, the 'default' mean (all samples) is ~87. I will use a balanced window (recent_N with N=9) to capture the high-demand peak and the recent drop, which results in a mu_hat that acknowledges the slowdown while maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 26; recent demand (P32-P34) shows a sharp decline (avg ~18.6) following a high-demand peak (avg ~130 in P26-P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a high-demand regime (P26-P31, avg ~130), demand plummeted in P32-P34 (33, 5, 18). However, Period 35 saw a sharp rebound to 144, completely clearing the starting on-hand inventory of 144. This confirms the 'high volatility' identified in carry-over insights and suggests the low-demand stretch was temporary. I am currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, the optimal service level (q) is 0.8. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the recent high-volatility regime (P26-P35), which encompasses both the peak (163) and the troughs (5), providing a balanced estimate of mean demand (~88) and high variance. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as a primary characteristic: Period 35 demand (144) marks a sharp rebound from the three-period low (avg ~18.6), suggesting no sustained low-demand regime, but rather extreme fluctuations.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a significant drop in demand (Periods 32-34 averaging ~19 units), Period 35 saw a sharp rebound to 144 units, and Period 36 came in at 92 units. This confirms that the demand environment is characterized by wide swings rather than a sustained low-demand regime. The high-demand phase starting at Period 26 has an average of approximately 112 units (P26-P36). Given the critical nature of the 'chips' category and the profit ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio, a higher service level is preferred to capture spikes while being mindful of holding costs during troughs. I will use a recent window (N=11, covering the start of the high-volatility regime at P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as older data from P1-P25 is no longer representative of the current variance. L remains 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with no single stable average. Since Period 26, demand has fluctuated between 5 and 163 (P26: 132, P27: 111, P28: 157, P29: 133, P30: 81, P31: 163, P32: 33, P33: 5, P34: 18, P35: 144, P36: 92, P37: 32). The average of this high-volatility regime (P26-P37) is approximately 83.4, but the standard deviation relative to the mean is very high. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we should target a service level around 80% (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), which implies maintaining a buffer against the high-demand spikes. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this entire volatile regime (Periods 26 to 37). Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: High volatility regime (P26-P37) confirmed with demand ranging 5-163 and average demand of ~83. Earlier high-demand period average (~130 in P26-P31) has been diluted by recent low-demand outliers, resulting in a lower regime average but persistent variance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for \u2018chips(Regular)\u2019 continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the regime that started at Period 26. Since Period 32, demand values have been [33, 5, 18, 144, 92, 32, 100], illustrating a lack of stable mean. The average demand for this high-volatility window (P26-P38) is approximately 85.3, but the range (5 to 163) and high frequency of stockouts followed by inventory gluts require a responsive strategy. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=13, covering the start of the current volatility regime at P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior without being overly biased by the extremely quiet periods (P32-P34) or the more stable early history. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes up to ~150 units while acknowledging the high risk (sigma) of the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, moving between near-zero (Period 33: 5 units) and very high levels (Period 31: 163 units; Period 35: 144 units). The mean of the current volatile regime (starting Period 26, 14 samples) is approximately 89, but the standard deviation is extremely high. Following a low demand of 30 in Period 39, and an on-hand inventory of 109, we need to account for a potential sharp rebound. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (from the start of this high-volatility regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this wide variance and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to protect against the frequent spikes without excessive overstocking, as profit ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which has been the dominant characteristic since Period 26. In the most recent periods (P35-P40), demand has swung from 144 to 92, 32, 100, 30, and most recently 139. This confirms that the demand environment is not in a stable regime but is subject to frequent, large-scale fluctuations. Period 40 concluded with 0 units on-hand after a demand of 139 units outpaced the starting inventory of 135 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. To manage this volatility and recapture service levels while respecting the OR backend's inventory caps, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=15 (covering Period 26 to Period 40) captures the entirety of this high-volatility regime, providing a mean and standard deviation that reflect the current distribution's wide range. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a high service level (calculated as profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) based on the high variance observed in this specific regime.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime (P26-P40) confirmed: Demand fluctuates between 5 and 163 with no discernable trend, requiring a high safety stock to buffer against frequent spikes above 130 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 26). Recent demand has fluctuated wildly, with values like 144, 92, 32, 100, 30, 139, and 89. This high variance makes a single-point mean unreliable. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering the entire high-volatility regime from Period 26 to 41) to capture both the average demand (~88 over the last 16 periods) and the significant variance (Std Dev ~52). This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against demand spikes above 130 while accounting for the frequent low-demand periods. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (Period 26-42 range: 5 to 163 units). Period 42 demand was 76, following Period 41's 89. While recent demand has stabilized slightly compared to the extreme swings of P31-P35, the regime shift since Period 26 is still the most relevant context. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost, a service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)) is targeted by the OR backend. I am using recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire high-volatility regime starting at Period 26, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the frequent spikes observed in this window (e.g., demands of 132, 111, 157, 133, 163, 144, 139) while not overreacting to individual low-demand outliers.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P41-P43) has stabilized somewhat (89, 76, 60) with an average of ~75, which is lower than the high-volatility regime average (~130 in P26-P31) but still consistent with the overall volatility established since Period 26. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the high volatility and the fact that stockouts have occurred frequently when demand spikes (e.g., P31, P40), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window that captures this volatile regime starting from Period 26 (N=18). This period covers the range of extreme highs and lows, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to handle potential rebounds while accounting for the high observed standard deviation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, as seen in the recent fluctuations from 60 (P43) up to 126 (P44). Period 44 demand (126) is near the upper end of the recent regime average (~80-90) but significantly higher than the previous two periods, confirming the persistent volatility noted in the Carry-over Insights (min 5, max 163 since P26). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the short game horizon (5 periods remaining) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will use a conservative mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain high service levels and capture potential demand spikes above 130. I'm choosing recent_N with N=19 to cover the entire high-volatility regime starting from Period 26, which provides a representative mean and standard deviation for this noisy phase.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 26). Recent demand values (P41-P45: 89, 76, 60, 126, 72) show a mix of moderate and high demand, maintaining an average of approximately 85 units over the last 5 periods, but with significant spikes as seen in P44. The on-hand inventory is 61 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use L=0. To capture the current volatile regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization around a moderate mean, I will use a recent_N of 20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N value covers the period from P26 to P45, encompassing the full scope of the high-volatility regime and providing a robust estimate for the base stock calculation to buffer against spikes while managing holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 26. In the most recent periods (P41-P46), demand has fluctuated between 18 and 126 units, with an average of approximately 73.5. Prior to this (P26-P40), the average was higher (~83), but the variance remains the dominant factor. Given the 0-period lead time, the inventory is replenished same-day, yet the OR backend's base-stock calculation requires stable \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 inputs to maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs. I will use the last 21 periods (P26 to P46) as the relevant regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this high-variance behavior while filtering out the older, more stable demand data from P1-P25. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (q = 4 / (4 + 1)), which the OR backend will target using these updated parameters.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P41-P47) continues to exhibit the high volatility previously observed, with demand ranging from 18 to 126. The average demand since Period 26 (the start of the current high-volatility regime) is approximately 84.8 units, but the most recent 7 periods (P41-P47) have a slightly lower average of 66.4. However, given the propensity for sudden spikes (e.g., P44 was 126), a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 is chosen for mu_hat to capture the broader volatility of the current regime while acknowledging slightly lower recent levels. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to ensure the OR engine maintains an adequate safety stock for this volatile SKU. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, as seen in all concluded periods, so L is set to 'default'.

Daily Profit: $432.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand spiked to an all-time high of 192, depleting all on-hand inventory. This confirms the persistent high-volatility regime identified since Period 26, where demand swings between single digits and nearly 200 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the game is ending at Period 50, and we are currently at Period 49, we have two periods of demand remaining (Period 49 and Period 50). Using the recent high-volatility regime (P26-P48, N=23) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average (~79 units) and the extreme variability. Setting mu_hat with recent_N (N=23) captures the current phase's average, while sigma_hat (N=23) provides the necessary safety stock to buffer against another potential spike like the 192 seen last period. The lead time L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Extreme high-demand outlier confirmed; Period 48 demand reached 192, the highest in the history, reinforcing the regime of high volatility (range 5-192) that began in Period 26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the regime that began in Period 26. Recent demand has spiked significantly, with Period 48 reaching 192 units and Period 49 reaching 182 units, both of which are the highest recordings in the history. This indicates a potential upward shift in mean demand or at least a period of sustained high-impact spikes. Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, we must order aggressively to cover the (L+1) period demand window. I will use recent_N (N=24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-variance behavior observed since Period 26, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the recent extreme outliers (182, 192) in its safety stock and base stock calculations. The lead time L remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have consistently been same-day.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Sustained high-demand spike sequence confirmed (P48: 192, P49: 182). This reinforces the high-volatility regime started at P26 but suggests a higher possible upper bound for demand spikes than previously recorded.
