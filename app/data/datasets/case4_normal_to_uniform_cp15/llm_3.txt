  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available to meet demand immediately. The historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], which yields an average of 111.4 units. Since I have no stock to cover the current period's demand, I need to place an order that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a small safety stock Buffer. Given a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the cost of a stockout is higher than the cost of holding inventory. I will target approximately 130 units to ensure coverage for the first period's demand while accounting for potential variance seen in the high end of the historical samples (138).",

  "rationale": "The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple item. Lead time is reliably 0 periods (order arrives same-period). Historical demand analysis shows distinct regime shifts: the current regime (P36-P46) reflects high volatility with demand values ranging from 18 to 144. The most recent period (P46) saw a sharp drop to 18, following a period of 72. Looking at history, low-demand periods (e.g., P32-P34) often last 2-3 periods before a potential spike occurs. Current inventory is 142 units. Since lead time is 0, I can satisfy demand from on-hand inventory and only need to order to maintain a safety buffer for the next period. Given the high volatility (peak demand around 165), I aim for a target inventory of ~160 units. With 142 on hand, a small top-up order is sufficient. I will order 18 units to reach the target of 160.",

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility, shifting between high-volume spikes (100+) and low-volume troughs (<30). Recent demand in Period 46 (18) and Period 47 (24) suggests we are currently in a low-demand phase similar to the P32-P34 segment. Historically, these low phases last around 3-4 periods before a sharp rebound. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 136 units. Given that we are at Period 48 out of 50, and the holding cost is $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit, I must balance the risk of a demand spike (which can reach ~160) against the high cost of holding inventory into the final periods. With 136 units on hand and 0-period lead time, I already have enough to cover a moderate spike. Since the game is ending in 2 periods, I will order 0 to avoid being left with excessive ending inventory, which would incur holding costs and negate profits in the final tally.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with sharp spikes and sudden drops. Period 48 experienced an unprecedented demand spike of 192, the highest recorded in the entire history, which resulted in a stockout (on-hand is 0). Since the promised and historical actual lead time is 0 periods, an order placed now will arrive and be available for demand within this same Period 49. As this is the penultimate period (P49 of 50), I must order enough to cover Period 49's potential spike while avoiding excessive holding costs going into the final period. Given the recent spike of 192 and previous highs around 160-170, I will target 180 units to manage the current demand surge and provide a lean buffer for the final period.",

Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the game state indicates Period 50 is the final period (50/50), I need to order enough to satisfy the expected high demand while acknowledging that any ending inventory will incur a holding cost ($1) but won't contribute to future revenue ($4/unit profit). Based on the most recent two periods, demand is approximately 180-192. I will target 185 units to balance the risk of a stockout (losing $4 profit) against the cost of overstocking (losing $1 holding cost), leaning towards capturing the potential high revenue.",
