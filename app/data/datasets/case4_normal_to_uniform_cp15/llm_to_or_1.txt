Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 0, the total demand to cover is (1 + L) = 1 period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand statistics and set L to 'default' as we have no evidence yet that the lead time deviates from the promised 0 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0 periods (order arrived and was available for Period 1 demand). Starting inventory was 127, demand was 107, leaving 20 units on-hand. Looking at historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the most recent demand of 107, the mean is approximately 110.6. There is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) to set the demand parameters and 'default' for lead time since the promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, the observed lead time was 0, consistent with the promised lead time. Demand for the last 5 periods (including historical data provided) was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the most recent demands during the simulation were 107 and 116. The average demand across all 7 available data points is approximately 111.4 units. Since there is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet, I will use all available samples (N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) to stabilize the forecast. Current on-hand inventory is low (9 units), so the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the immediate period demand given L=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms that orders arrive in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand over the first 3 periods was [107, 116, 64], plus the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the full history mean (8 samples): (112+97+116+138+94+107+116+64) / 8 = 105.5. The recent demand in Period 3 (64) was significantly lower than the average, but with only 3 periods of game history, it's too early to confirm a downward trend or regime shift. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the last 2 pre-game and 3 in-game points) to balance long-term average with recent volatility. With lead time L=0, the OR backend targets the demand for the next period (1+L=1). On-hand inventory is currently 60, below the required stock to meet expected demand of ~105-115 units, so the system will place a replenishment order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64, 92] (in-game). The mean of the combined 9 samples is 104.3. Inventory analysis: We have 35 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. There are no signs of shipment loss or significant regime shifts, though demand in Period 3 was relatively low. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=9. L will remain at the default (0) as it is reliable. This setup allows the OR backend to target a base stock level that covers the 104 units expected this period with a safety buffer determined by the standard deviation of recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 5 periods, the observed demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with samples: [107, 116, 64, 92, 88]. The mean demand is approximately 93.4 units, though Period 3 showed a significant dip (64). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there are no seasonal dates or product-specific events available to suggest a regime shift, I will use all 5 historical samples to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters. I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the full history while allowing the system to adapt to new trends as they emerge.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 6 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but appears relatively stable. Demand values per period are: 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84. The mean demand of all observed periods (including the 5 seeded samples) is approximately 100 units per period. Since L=0, mu_hat should cover 1 period of demand (1+L). I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 0) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data (11 samples), as no clear regime shift is yet confirmed after the initial variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time L=0 has been consistently observed across all 7 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown relative stability. Historical demand including the pre-game samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the game history [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93] suggests a mean around 100 units. Period 3 (demand 64) was an outlier on the low side, but recent periods (P4-P7) show a consistent range of 84-93. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7 to include the standard game history) to capture the current demand level. Since lead time is 0, the OR backend will calculate base_stock for (1+0)=1 period. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, resulting in a z-score of ~0.84 to protect against stockouts during the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand spiked to 137, while only 107 units were on-hand (causing 30 units of lost sales). History shows demand fluctuated previously but has been relatively stable until this recent spike. The observed actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts from similar demand surges, I am using a recent window (N=5) to better capture the higher mean and variance observed in the last few periods (84, 93, 137 compared to earlier lower values). This will raise the base stock level to account for the Recent_N mean (~101) and the higher standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 9 periods, with an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. In Period 8, a demand spike of 137 units led to a stockout (selling 107 units), but inventory recovered in Period 9. Given the stable but slightly volatile nature of demand (std dev approx 21), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full recent history since the start. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) demand window (current period + lead time) and the observed volatility to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown high variability with two major spikes (137 in P8 and 124 in P10) compared to lower values (78 in P9). The mean demand over all 10 periods is approximately 98.3, but the last 5 periods show a slightly higher trend and increased volatility. Lead time consistent at 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target an 80% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and ensure enough safety stock to cover spikes, as stockouts occurred in Period 8 and Period 10.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility over the 11 observed periods. The demand history is [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58]. Analysis reveals a mean demand of approximately 94.6 units. There is no clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift evident from this sequence. Stockouts occurred in Period 8 and Period 10, suggesting the baseline stock levels were slightly insufficient to handle the high-end variance (spikes of 137 and 124). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will use the 'default' method for lead time as the promise is holding. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full recent distribution, ensuring the OR engine accounts for the high variance observed in Periods 8 and 10 to minimize further stockouts while balancing holding costs.

The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every concluding period, where orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 24 units on hand and 0 in transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to calculate the mean and standard deviation from all available data in this session, as the demand appears relatively stable without a distinct regime shift lately (though Period 8 and 10 saw spikes). Using N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat with L=0 will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for the recent variability, targeting the optimal service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.80).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, resulting in a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). Reviewing the history for Periods 1-13, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been relatively stable, with a mean of 96.7 units and a standard deviation of 22.8 units over the last 13 periods. Period 13 concluded with 11 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The recent demand (Period 13) was 104, which is near the average. Since there are no observed regime shifts or seasonal signals in the provided data (generic Period labels), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the full recent history while being slightly more responsive than 'default'. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown some variability but remains centered around the initial historical mean of ~111 and the observed game mean of ~96. Specifically, the last 5 demands are [124, 58, 92, 104, 115], averaging 98.6. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to 14 arriving in the same period they were placed. Since there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals provided by the date labels (Period_X), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the representative game-period demand while smoothing out the high variance (std ~23 in game). I'll also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 and keep L at 'default' (0). The ending inventory for Period 14 was 0, so the OR backend needs to place an order sufficient to cover Period 15's expected demand immediately.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, confirmed through Period 15. Demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations, averaging approximately 98 units over the last 15 periods (including historical pre-game data). In Periods 8, 10, 14, and 15, we experienced stockouts or near-stockouts, suggesting the existing inventory levels were slightly insufficient to cover demand spikes. Since the inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, I will set mu_hat based on the mean of the most recent 10 periods (approx 101 units) to better capture the recent demand level. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), a base stock based on the recent average and standard deviation will help maintain a sufficient service level without excessive holding costs. L is set to calculated as 0 is consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits significant variance, with the last 5 periods showing demands of 92, 104, 115, 118, and 61. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units. Based on historical data, the mean demand over the last 16 periods is approximately 102.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will maintain the lead time at 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent window of 16 periods to capture the full range of the current demand regime which seems fairly homogeneous, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the high variability observed (e.g., peak demand of 137 vs low of 58). This approach helps mitigate stockouts seen in Periods 8, 10, 14, and 15 by slightly increasing the safety stock held against the target service level (approx 80% based on profit/holding ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stayed relatively stable but has shown high variance in recent periods, specifically an unusual drop to 6 units in Period 17, following a sequence of demands near 100 units. Given this high volatility and current high on-hand inventory (110 units), I want to avoid overstocking while ensuring enough is available if demand reverts to the long-term mean (~96 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use the recent N (N=17) method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader variance while accounting for the recent low demand, which brings the mean down slightly to better manage holding costs.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 16-18) has shown significant volatility, specifically a sharp drop in Period 17 (demand=6) followed by a moderate recovery in Period 18 (demand=87). Historical demand before this period averaged around 95-100 units. The zero-period lead time has remained consistent across all 18 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to the holding cost ($1), the target service level (q) is 0.8. Since there is currently no specific seasonal information or explanation for the Period 17 outlier, I will use a recent window of 10 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window is long enough to smooth out the extreme low of Period 17 while remaining responsive to the general demand level which appears to be fluctuating between 60 and 120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility. After a long period of demand averaging around 100 units (Periods 1-16), Period 17 saw an extreme drop to 6 units, followed by 87 and 43. The initial pre-game samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) average 111.4. The full history (including pre-game) average is 98.4, but the last 5 periods (15-19) average 63. This looks like a regime shift or a period of high instability rather than a stable seasonal dip given the 6 unit outlier. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent downward trend while maintaining some safety stock. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 19 previous periods arriving same-day. sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance seen in the last few periods (dropping from 118 to 6 and back to 87).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility observed from Period 17 onwards; average demand has dropped from ~100 to ~63 over the last 5 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 16-20: 61, 6, 87, 43, 82) shows a significant decrease in average demand compared to the initial periods. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. For Period 21, the mean demand of the last 5 periods is 55.8, while the standard deviation is notably higher due to the extreme outlier in Period 17 (demand of 6). Using a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture this new, lower demand regime while accounting for the increased volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0, so 'default' (promised lead time 0) is suitable. This approach ensures base stock calculation reflects current localized trends while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked significantly to 171 units, leading to a complete stockout (ending inventory 0, on-hand 0). This contradicts the previously noted downward trend. The average demand across all historical data (P1-P21) is approximately 96, while the recent 3-period average is 98.7 and the recent 5-period average is 77.8. Given the high stockout cost (Profit $4.0 vs Holding $1.0), I am shifting back to a more robust demand estimate. I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend while being responsive to the recent spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high; a significant spike in P21 (171 units) reversed a short-term downward trend (P17-P20 avg ~55). Average demand has reverted closer to the historical mean of 95-100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the demand was 47 units, following a massive spike to 171 units in Period 21. This confirms my previous assessment of extreme volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 86 units, which is close to the long-term historical mean (~95) but reflects the recent wild swings. Given that the lead time is 0, the order arrives and is used to satisfy demand within the same period. Since on-hand (83) is close to the recent average demand (86), I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the drop in P17 and the subsequent volatility) to allow the OR engine to stabilize. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=10) to properly capture the high variance seen recently (6 to 171), ensuring the base stock level accounts for these spikes without over-ordering excessively due to the high holding cost ratio (1:4).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility in recent periods (P17-P23), ranging from 6 to 171. The most recent demand (P23) was very low at 12 units, following local cycles of high and low demand. Promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the on-hand inventory is 99 units and recent volatility makes a simple long-term mean unreliable, I am using a recent_N approach. I'll set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-variance behavior of the last 'regime' (P17 onwards), which includes both the massive spike and the deep troughs. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current instability while recognizing the high on-hand balance.

Demand has been highly volatile recently: after a massive spike in Period 21 (171), demand dropped significantly in Period 23 (12) and Period 24 (56). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is approximately 78, while the mean over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 73.6. Given the extreme volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 59 over the last 5 periods), a cautious approach is needed to handle potential spikes without overstocking during lulls. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the localized mean of approximately 78, and for sigma_hat I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock (safety stock) to account for the erratic demand swings seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified from Period 21-24: following a spike of 171, demand recorded 47, 12, and 56, indicating a highly unstable regime requiring higher safety stock.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), demand values have been [6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12, 56, 59]. The mean of these 9 periods is approximately 62.7, which is significantly lower than the long-term historical mean (~95), yet the period-to-period swings (standard deviation) are very high. Period 25's demand was 59, continuing a more moderate trend following the P21 spike. Given this instability, I am using a recent window of N=9 to capture this lower but highly variable demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. By using recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR engine will better account for the current lower mean and the elevated risk of another high-demand spike like the one seen in P21, ensuring sufficient safety stock while acknowledging the overall lower average demand levels observed since Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift (P17-P25): Average demand decreased to ~63 (was ~95) but with increased volatility (CV > 0.7) and occasional extreme peaks (e.g., P21=171).

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the system recorded a demand of 132 units, exceeding the available inventory and confirming that the 'lower demand' regime (avg ~63) is plagued by high-impact spikes (similar to Period 21's 171 units). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit, making this a critical ordering period. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), I must ensure the order covers both the expected mean and the significant volatility to avoid stockouts. I will use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the shift that started around Period 17, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to 55 to protect against the frequent spikes (standard deviation for the last 10 periods is approximately 50-55). This approach balances the lower average demand with the high risk of stockouts during unpredictable peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed stockout (demand 132 vs 104 available). High volatility regime (P17-P26) persists; mean has decreased but coefficient of variation remains high due to sudden spikes (171 in P21, 132 in P26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand was 111 units, which is high but consistent with the volatility noticed since Period 21. We are currently in a high-variance regime where demand fluctuates between low values (12, 56) and significant spikes (171, 132, 111). The average demand over the last 11 periods (P17-P27) is approximately 73, but recent spikes suggest the lower 'mean' inferred in earlier periods (63) was an underestimate for this volatile period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To account for this instability and prevent stockouts seen in P21 and P26, I am using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the window from the 171 spike onwards) and N=11 for sigma_hat to capture the full range of recent volatility. This provides a balance between the lower demand periods and the sudden high-demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with three significant spikes (>110) in the last 7 periods (P21, P26, P27). The regime since Period 17 demonstrates an unstable mean with a high coefficient of variation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P26-P28) shows a significant upward shift and continued high volatility with values of 132, 111, and 157. This suggests the prior regime shift (Period 17-25, avg ~63) has been superseded by a higher demand phase or severe volatility spikes. The recent 3-period average is ~133, significantly higher than the long-term historical mean (~95). To capture this surge and maintain service levels despite the volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3. This focuses the OR engine on the most immediate demand level. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed Period 26-28: Recent 3-period average demand is 133, versus the previous regime's average of 63. Volatility remains high, requiring responsive safety stock configuration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demand values of 132, 111, 157, and 133, following a period of much lower and unstable demand (P17-P25 avg ~61). This recent 4-period average is approximately 133 units, representing a significant upward level shift. Despite a zero promised lead time, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. However, recent stockouts in P26 and P28 highlight the need for a higher base stock to accommodate this new demand level and its associated volatility. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this latest demand surge for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory level (20 on hand) is replenished to cover the expected demand of ~133 plus safety stock in the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P26-P29): 4-period average demand is 133.25, significantly higher than the P17-P25 average of 61. Volatility remains high, with demand exceeding 130 in 3 of the last 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. While Period 30 saw a dip to 81, the preceding sequence (132, 111, 157, 133) confirms a significantly higher mean compared to early periods. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 122.8 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maximize reward, I must ensure high availability to capture this high demand while managing the risk of stockouts seen in P26 and P28. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize this recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the current ~123 unit mean and its associated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 26, entering a high-volume, high-volatility phase. The last 6 periods (P26-P31) show demands of [132, 111, 157, 133, 81, 163], averaging 129.5 units. Period 31 resulted in a stockout (163 demand vs 147 available). This volatility (CV approx 0.24 in the new regime) combined with frequent stockouts (P26, P28, P31) necessitates using a recent window for demand estimation to remain responsive. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover these frequent spikes over 130 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P26-P31): 6-period average demand is 129.5, with frequent spikes exceeding 150 units leading to stockouts in P28 and P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 118 units over the last 7 periods (P26-P32). While the initial phase of this surge (P26-P29) averaged ~133, a very low demand in P32 (33 units) following a stockout in P31 (demand 163) suggests extreme variance. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. Current on-hand inventory is 123. To handle this instability and the risk of spikes exceeding 150 (as seen in P28 and P31), I will use a recent_N window for both mean and sigma calculation. I choose N=7 to capture the entirety of this high-demand, high-volatility regime (P26-P32), which balances the high recent peaks with the latest low dip. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected high mean while providing enough safety stock for the frequent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: High-demand regime (P26-P32) shows extreme instability; even though average is ~118, individual periods fluctuate between 33 and 163. CV is significantly higher than earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile phase since Period 26, characterized by alternating spikes (e.g., P31 demand=163) and deep troughs (e.g., P33 demand=5). The most recent regime (P26-P33) has an average demand of approximately 102 units, but with a standard deviation significantly higher than the earlier periods. Period 33 specifically showed a massive drop in demand (5 units), leaving me with 150 units on hand for Period 34. Given that the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (suggesting an 80% service level target), and the lead time is consistently 0, I need to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover potential spikes without excessive overstocking. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the high-volatility regime starting at P26) to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately while smoothing the most recent outlier of 5. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme demand instability continues in the P26-P33 regime; while the average is ~102, demand ranges from 5 to 163, requiring high sigma settings despite intermittent low-demand periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P32-P34: 33, 5, 18) marks a significant drop compared to the high-demand regime of P26-P31 (avg ~130). We are currently in a highly volatile period where demand swings between extreme highs (>150) and extreme lows (<20). With on-hand inventory at 133 and the current trend showing low demand, I will use a recent window (N=9, covering P26-P34) to capture the overall volatility of this current regime while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the low demand seen in the last three periods. The profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio suggests a critical ratio of 0.8, which requires maintaining sufficient safety stock to protect against the sudden spikes observed previously in this regime (e.g., P26, P28, P31).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme within the P26-P34 regime; following a high-demand phase (avg ~130), the last 3 periods (P32-P34) have averaged only ~19 units, indicating a possible secondary shift or internal cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a 3-period low (P32-P34 avg ~19), Period 35 saw a massive spike back to 144 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). This confirms my previous assessment that we are in a high-instability regime (P26-P35) where demand fluctuates between near-zero and >150. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical priority is capturing these sudden spikes. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to encompass this volatile regime (P26-P35), which averages ~108 units per period but with a high standard deviation. Lead time remains stable at 0. This configuration ensures the base stock is high enough to cover significant demand surges while acknowledging the intermittent nature of the demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Rebounds from low-demand phase with a spike of 144, cementing the P26-P35 regime as one of extreme oscillation (range 5-163, mean ~108).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the regime starting at Period 26. Since P26, the demand sequence has been: 132, 111, 157, 133, 81, 163, 33, 5, 18, 144, 92. This averages roughly 88 units but with a range from 5 to 163 and a high coefficient of variation. The most recent demand (P36) was 92, following a spike of 144. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 (the length of the current high-volatility regime starting at P26) to capture the trend while allowing for the extreme swings. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to ensure a high safety stock buffer against the frequent spikes that have previously caused stockouts (P26, P28, P31, P35). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting around Period 26) is characterized by extreme oscillation and high volatility (ranging from 5 to 163). In the most recent periods (P35-P37), demand went from 144 to 92 to 32, suggesting we are currently in a downward swing of this volatile cycle. However, given the profit of $4 versus a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio (q = 0.8) favors maintaining a high service level to capture sudden spikes (like P35's 144). I will use a 12-period window (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of this unstable regime (P26-P37), ensuring the OR engine accounts for the high variance in its base stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P26-P38) continues to exhibit extreme oscillation and high volatility, with demand ranging from 5 to 163. The most recent demand (P38) was 100, following 32 and 92, suggesting the volatility isn't dampening. Since lead time remains stable at 0 periods, I will focus on capturing the high variance of the current regime. I am setting N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the entirety of the current volatile regime (P26-P38), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for both the high spikes and the intermittent low periods. The backend's critical ratio (4/5 = 0.8) and the high sigma from the recent_N method will provide the necessary safety stock to buffer against another potential 150+ unit spike while avoiding excessive overstock during low-demand troughs.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the current regime (starting Period 26). Recent demand values (P35-P39: 144, 92, 32, 100, 30) demonstrate a sequence of sharp oscillations with a mean of 79.6, but individual periods vary from 30 to 144. This reflects the same pattern of instability noted in the carry-over insights since P26 (range 5-163). Because the oscillations are significant and unpredictable, I will use a recent_N window (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full breadth of the current high-volatility regime (P26-P39) to ensure the OR backend accounts for both the lower average demand observed in the last few periods and the ever-present risk of another triple-digit spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime (P26-P39) confirmed as highly oscillatory with a mean of ~98 and a standard deviation of ~53, characterized by frequent swings between <35 and >130 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand spiked to 139 units, resulting in a stockout (starting inventory 135 was depleted). This continues the highly oscillatory pattern identified in the P26-P40 regime, where demand swings between extreme lows (<30) and highs (>130). The mean for this regime (P26-P40) is approximately 98.7 with a high standard deviation (approx 53.6). Given the zero on-hand inventory entering Period 41 and the pattern of immediate rebounds after high-demand periods (though inconsistent), I will maintain the base stock to cover this higher volatility. Using recent_N with N=15 captures the start of this specific regime (Period 26). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand regime (P26-P40) remains highly oscillatory (mean ~99, \u03c3 ~54) with frequent stockouts (P26, P28, P31, P35, P40) when inventory falls below 140 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 remains highly oscillatory with a mean of approximately 99 and a standard deviation of 54. The most recent demand was 89 in Period 41, following a stockout in Period 40 (demand of 139). Our on-hand inventory is 49 units. Given the profit ($4.0) to holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the critical fractile is 0.8, which mandates a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=16, spanning Period 26 to 41) to capture this high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the frequent spikes (up to 163) observed in this period range while maintaining a base stock level sufficient to prevent the frequent stockouts observed whenever inventory drops below 140.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the highly oscillatory regime identified around Period 26. In the most recent period (P42), demand was 76, which is consistent with the oscillatory pattern (mean ~99 since P26). The inventory position is currently 60 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we need to ensure the order covers the potential for a high-demand spike in Period 43, which has frequently exceeded 130-150 units in this regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering P26 to P42) to capture the current regime's mean (approx 89.5). For sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' with a value of 55 to account for the high volatility observed (standard deviation is roughly 50-55 in this period range), ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P40.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P26-P43) remains highly oscillatory but shows a slight reduction in mean demand over the last three periods (89, 76, 60). However, the history of this regime is characterized by sudden spikes (e.g., 144 in P35, 139 in P40), meaning that reducing inventory targets too drastically based on a short window could lead to stockouts. The mean demand for the entire oscillatory regime (P26-P43) is approximately 91.5 with a high standard deviation (approx 52). Given that profit ($4.0) is much higher than holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio (q = 0.8) favors maintaining a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 18 (covering the entire oscillatory period from P26 onwards) to capture both the mean shifts and the sustained high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $499.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the highly oscillatory regime established around Period 26, characterized by a mean of approximately 100 units and a high standard deviation (\u03c3 \u2248 54). Recent demand in Period 44 was 126 units, confirming that spikes above 120 are still frequent. The current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) with no units in-transit. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will maintain L=0. To ensure high service level and prevent stockouts during this volatile end-of-game phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (P26-P44) to capture the full breadth of the current oscillatory regime. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the average demand (~95) and the significant variance (\u03c3 ~56), aiming for a target inventory level that can absorb the frequent spikes seen in the history.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 continues to be highly oscillatory but has shown a relatively stable mean around 90-100 units over the long term, with a more recent 5-period average (P41-P45) of 84.6. However, the standard deviation remains high (approx. 54 based on previous analysis), and the product 'chips(Regular)' frequently experiences spikes that lead to stockouts if inventory is insufficient. The current on-hand inventory is 61 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I want to ensure the target base stock (mu + z*sigma) covers this volatility. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat to capture the current regime's average while smoothing the oscillations, and recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to maintain high enough safety stock to protect against the frequent spikes (>130 units) observed in this regime. This approach balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: The current demand regime (since Period 26) remains highly oscillatory. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), demand has fluctuated between 18 and 139, with an average of 75.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 39. Although the most recent demand (P46) was low (18), the previous periods show frequent spikes (126 in P44). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility behavior while reflecting the slight downward shift in the local mean compared to the peak high-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand inventory is 113, and there are no units in-transit.

The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by high oscillation (range 5-163). In the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), demand has averaged approximately 73.4 units, but with significant swings (139 in P40, 126 in P44, versus 18 and 24 in the last two periods). Although the last two periods show low demand, the history of this regime suggests a spike is likely imminent. Given the current 89 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will use a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the recent mean shift. The critical service level required (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.80) necessitates a robust sigma estimate to prevent stockouts during the frequent peaks seen in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime (P26-P47) remains highly oscillatory but the 10-period moving average has trended lower to ~73. Frequent swings between low-demand (<30) and high-demand (>120) continue to be the primary risk.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand spiked to 192 units, the highest recorded in the entire history, resulting in a total stockout. This confirms that the 'highly oscillatory' demand regime (P26-P48) is still active and capable of extreme surges, even though the recent moving average had trended lower. With the current on-hand inventory at 0 and entering the final two periods (P49 and P50), the priority is to cover the potential for another high-demand spike to maximize profit and avoid a second consecutive stockout. The mean demand for the oscillatory regime (P26-P48) is approximately 84 with a standard deviation of 56. Given the critical need to captured any remaining demand in the final periods and the recent 192 spike, I am using an explicit mu_hat grounded in the regime average plus a buffer to handle the high volatility (z-score for 80% service level is ~0.84, so 84 + 0.84*56 \u2248 131). Sigma remains explicit at 56 to reflect the true volatility of this regime. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand volatility remains extreme; P48 recorded a record high of 192 units, re-confirming that the oscillatory regime (P26-P48) can produce massive spikes despite lower recent averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $716.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains extremely oscillatory and high-risk. Period 49 recorded demand of 182, following a record high of 192 in Period 48, both resulting in stockouts. The recent 5-period average (P45-P49) has surged to 97.6, but the extreme volatility (range 18-192) makes the simple mean an insufficient target. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=24, covering the entire oscillatory regime starting at P26) to capture the long-run average of ~96, but I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 65 (higher than the regime's standard deviation of ~54) to force the OR backend to maintain higher safety stock and protect against the frequent spikes exceeding 180 units. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme demand spikes confirmed: Period 48 (192) and Period 49 (182) represent the highest demand levels in the history of the SKU, confirming that the oscillatory regime (P26+) is currently in a hyper-peak phase.
