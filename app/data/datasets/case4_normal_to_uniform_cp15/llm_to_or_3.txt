Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 of 50. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), implying a high service level is optimal to maximize reward. Initial demand history shows a mean of 111.4 units over the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. With no prior observations of lead time drift or seasonality confirmed yet, I will use 'default' or 'calculate' methods to establish a baseline.mu_hat will be set to use all 5 historical samples to stabilize the initial order. Since the promised lead time is 0, the backend will target covering demand for the current period (L+1 = 1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time (L) of 0. The order arrived in the same period (L=0 confirmed), resulting in 107 units sold and 20 units ending on-hand inventory. The historical demand data provided [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the observed Period 1 demand of 107 gives 6 samples with a mean of 110.6 and a standard deviation of 15.6. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable, but we should maintain a buffer. Since L=0, the review+lead period is 1. The OR backend will use these stats to calculate a base stock. I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' methods to let the backend process these samples. Since there are only 6 samples total and no clear regime shift yet, 'recent_6' or 'default' is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we analyze the history of 'chips(Regular)'. In Period 1, the demand was 107 and lead time was 0. In Period 2, demand was 116 and lead time was again 0. The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will stick with the promised lead time of 0. Based on the provided demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the observed game history of [107, 116], the demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~111 with moderate volatility. I will use the 'default' method for L (L=0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage the complete historical sample size (7 samples), as no significant regime shift is yet detected in this early stage of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Periods 1 to 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). Demand has shown high variance recently, with values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64] (in-game). Period 3 saw a significant drop to 64 units, compared to the previous mean of ~112. However, with only one period of low demand, it is too early to declare a regime shift. I will use the 'default' calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which incorporates all available data points (8 total samples) to stabilize the base stock target against this latest outlier while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the high-profit margin (Profit=$4, Holding=$1, q=0.8). Pipeline inventory is currently 0, and on-hand is 60, so the OR backend will calculate a replenishment order to reach the targeted base stock level for an L=0 environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met based on historical conclude messages (P1-P4). Total demand samples observed: 107, 116, 64, 92, and the provided pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating mean demand: (112+97+116+138+94+107+116+64+92) / 9 = 104. Standard deviation is approximately 19.9. I will use the 'default' method for L since lead time has consistently been 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a stable baseline, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, though P3 seeing 64 demand was a notable dip. The OR backend will use the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat where z is determined by critical fractile 4/(4+1) = 0.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean of approximately 93.4 units (samples: 107, 116, 64, 92, 88). There are no strong seasonal signals yet, as the periods are just starting. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a service level around the 80th percentile is optimal. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use the 'default' method for lead time as it has proven reliable at 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent performance while smoothing out the outlier from Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $309.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the last 6 periods has been [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84], following historical samples of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average demand across all 11 known data points is approximately 101 units. There is a slight downward trend in the last 4 periods (64, 92, 88, 84), averaging 82 units, compared to the overall mean. However, given the variability, using a recent window of N=5 captures the most relevant current behavior (mean 88.8). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (actual observed L=0), matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to stay responsive to recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable stock level. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (service level target ~0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 7 periods has been [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93], while the pre-game history showed [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the mean of the in-game data, we see an average of approximately 92 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (12 units) with nothing in-transit, which is expected for L=0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the in-game demand level while reflecting the stabilization around 90 units, and stick with the 'default' lead time (0) and sigma calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand spiked to 137, exceeding the available inventory (107) and resulting in 30 lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders placed and arriving within the same period. The mean demand over the first 8 periods is approximately 97.6 units, but there's a recent upward trend with the last sample hitting 137. To prevent stockouts during this potential shift or spike, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and mean demand more effectively than the long-term average. Setting L to 'calculate' will confirm the 0-period lead time observed so far.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 9 periods has shown some volatility, with a mean around 95.4 units and a standard deviation around 21 units. Period 8 saw a demand spike (137) resulting in lost sales, while Period 9 slowed down (78). Given that on-hand inventory is 40 and there are no units in-transit, we need an order that covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (all available game data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, as it is more relevant than the initial pre-game samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is consistently supported by historical data (all 10 periods show lead_time=0). Demand has been somewhat volatile but stable in average (mean \u2248 98.3, recent N=5 mean \u2248 104). In Period 10, we saw a demand of 124 but could only sell 114 due to limited inventory. I will use a 0-period lead time. For demand forecasting, I've observed a slight upward shift in the last 5 periods compared to the very early data, so I will select recent_N for mu and sigma (N=5) to better capture recent volatility and prevent stockouts like those seen in Period 8 and 10.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility over the past 11 periods, with an average demand of 94.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 24.3 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages for all periods P1-P11. In periods 8 and 10, demand exceeded on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales, which suggests the need for a slightly more robust safety stock to handle peaks. Significant demand fluctuations (e.g., dropping to 58 in P11 after 124 in P10) indicate that a default approach using the full history is appropriate to capture the general mean while accounting for recent variability. I will use the 'default' method for L (maintaining the 0 lead time), mu_hat, and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical distribution for calculating the base stock level.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 94.5 over the last 12 periods (107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92). Including the 5 pre-game periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall mean is around 102. Recent demand is slightly lower but volatile. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. In-transit is 0 and on-hand is 28. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs (profit $4 vs cost $1), I will use the last 5 periods to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the most recent demand fluctuations (range 58-124). For L, I will continue with the proven 0-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms shipments arrive in the same period they are ordered (actual lead time = 0). Demand over the last 13 periods shows moderate volatility with a mean around 95-100 units. Recent demand samples are: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94 (pre-game) and 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92, 104 (game history). There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes detected in this segment. Therefore, I will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat which utilizes all available historical data to compute a stable base stock level. I will also use the default lead time (0) as it is consistently observed.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 97 units over the last 14 periods (mean=96.5, std=22.3). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to 14 arriving in the same period they were placed. This means the inventory position essentially resets every period. Given the current on-hand inventory of 4 units, I will use a default lead time estimate (L=0). For demand and volatility, I will use the recent 14-period window to capture the most relevant statistics, ensuring the backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1=1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0 periods, which has been consistently met throughout the first 15 periods. Historical demand for the last 15 periods has shown a mean of approximately 98 units (sum=1470), but several stockouts (Periods 8, 10, 15) indicate that the current base stock calculation may be failing to handle demand volatility, particularly when on-hand inventory drops to zero. I am setting L to 'default' (0) as it is reliable. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (mean of last 5: 97.4) to capture the most recent demand level. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to ensure a robust calculation of volatility that accounts for the historical spikes that led to stockouts, aiming for a higher service level to capture profits of $4.0/unit against a holding cost of $1.0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 16 periods without a clear seasonal or trend-based shift. The mean demand across all periods is approximately 95.3, with a standard deviation of 22.8. In Period 16, demand dropped to 61, while in Period 15 it was 118, indicating typical high volatility rather than a regime change. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the demand process appears stationary, I am using the 'default' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to incorporate the full historical sample (which currently provides a larger and more stable statistical base than a small recent window). The OR backend's base-stock calculation (q \u2248 0.8) will naturally target a service level that balances the profit margin ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 6 units, contrasting with the previous 16-period average of approximately 98 units. While this could be a sharp downward regime shift, it is more likely a single-period outlier or the start of a very low-demand phase. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer in case demand rebounds, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5. This includes the recent low-demand outlier but also the more typical demand levels from Periods 13-16. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a service level target of 80%), the OR engine's capped base-stock policy will still place a protective order if the calculated base stock exceeds the current on-hand inventory of 113. Observed actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and a slight downward trend compared to the initial historical samples. Specifically, Period 17 showed an anomalously low demand of 6 units, whereas other recent periods (15, 16, 18) were 118, 61, and 87 respectively. The last 10 periods (9-18) have an average demand of approximately 84 units with high variance. Given the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently being met, I will focus on standardizing the base stock around the most recent demand regime. I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the recent volatility and the mean shift from the earliest history (where mean was closer to 110) to the more recent performance (near 85-90). This will allow the OR backend to set a safety stock that accounts for the high variation seen in recent periods while preventing over-ordering due to the high holding cost relative to profit (4:1 ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted around Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~105 to ~85 units with significantly increased volatility (e.g., Period 17 demand of 6 vs Period 15 demand of 118).

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that the lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised. Demand remains highly volatile in the current regime (starting around Period 9). Recent demands show significant fluctuations: Period 15 (118), Period 16 (61), Period 17 (6), Period 18 (87), and Period 19 (43). The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P9-P19) is approximately 80.5, but the high standard deviation warrants a responsive approach. I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the statistics of this current high-volatility regime. Given the zero lead time and high inventory risk versus lost sales, this helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean while accommodating the high variance observed recently. Currently holding 72 units, which is close to the mean demand, so the OR engine will likely order a modest amount to maintain a buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 16-20 (61, 6, 87, 43, 82) shows an average of 55.8 units, which is significantly lower than the historical average (~100 in early periods). The volatility has increased markedly, particularly with the outlier demand of 6 in Period 17. The Carry-over insight suggested a regime shift around Period 9, but current data (P16-P20) indicates a further downward shift or at least high instability. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture a balance between the older higher demand periods and the most recent low demand streak, ensuring we have enough safety stock to handle the high volatility (sigma_hat) without over-ordering as the mean trends downwards.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 15 demand has weakened further, averaging ~56 units over the last 5 periods compared to the ~85 unit average noted at Period 19. Volatility remains extremely high (StdDev ~33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked to 171 units, the highest in the history of the game, resulting in an inventory stockout despite a recent trend of lower demand (~56 units). This suggests that high volatility persists (Period 17: 6, Period 21: 171). Because we are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I need to set parameters that cover the immediate demand of Period 22. Given the extreme fluctuation, I will use a recent window (N=6, covering periods 16-21) to capture the current volatility and the impact of the recent spike. The average demand for the last 6 periods is (61+6+87+43+82+171)/6 = 75 units, but the standard deviation is extremely high. By using recent_N (N=6), the mu_hat will be set to approximately 75 (for L=0, review+lead=1 period) and the sigma_hat will reflect the significant variance, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that protects against another potential spike while balancing the cost of holding inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified further in Period 21 (demand=171), following a period of relative weakness. Recent 6-period average is ~75 units, but the range is massive (6 to 171), necessitating a high safety stock buffer despite the low 0-period lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand was 47, following a massive spike to 171 in Period 21. The volatility for 'chips(Regular)' remains extremely high, even though the average demand has seemingly settled into a lower regime. The promised lead time is 0 and history confirms orders consistently arrive within the same period (L=0). Given the sharp, unpredictable swings (e.g., 171 followed by 47), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (from Period 16 to 22), which captures this high-volatility regime. This period (P16-P22) has demands of [61, 6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 71 and a very high standard deviation. Using N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that provides a sufficient safety buffer for potential spikes while accounting for the lower average demand observed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-55.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility with no clear stabilization. After a peak of 171 units in Period 21, demand plummeted to 47 in Period 22 and further to 12 in Period 23. This confirms the 'high volatility' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. With an on-hand inventory of 103 units, which is significantly higher than the average demand of the last few periods (~75), we are well-positioned for the current period. For the OR parameters, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high variance and the drop in average demand (approx. 65 units over the last 5 periods). Current inventory (103) is likely already above the calculated base stock, so the OR engine will likely place a small or zero order, minimizing holding costs while safety stock remains robust due to the high sigma_hat. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: High volatility regime continues with extreme low demand (12 units) observed in Period 23 following high periods. Last 5-period average has softened to ~65 units but with a range of 12-171.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility despite a 0-period lead time. Over the last 8 periods (since Period 17), demand has ranged from 6 to 171 units. The average demand in this high-volatility regime (P17-P24) is approximately 63.75 units. Period 24 demand was 56, which is close to this recent average. Given the massive swings (e.g., 171 in P21 followed by 47 and 12), the primary objective is to maintain a high enough base stock to capture spikes while recognizing the mean has shifted lower than the early-game average (~100). Using N=8 for mu_hat captures this recent regime average, while an explicit sigma_hat of 55 reflects the extreme standard deviation observed recently (approx. 50-60 range), ensuring the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to prevent stockouts during the next spike. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (Period 16 onwards), with demand ranging from 6 to 171 units. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is approximately 62.4 units, but the high variance necessitates a significant safety stock buffer because the service level target is high (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80). The observed lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the current regime's lower mean and higher volatility relative to the full history, I am using a N=10 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the lower average trend (~62 vs historical ~100) while respecting the recent spikes. Starting the period with 51 units on hand, the OR engine will determine the necessary order based on these updated parameters to meet the upcoming demand cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: The post-P15 period has stabilized into a lower-mean (~62 units), high-volatility regime. No further significant shifts detected in the last 3 periods (P23-P25) despite continued variance.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked significantly to 132 units, resulting in a stockout. This follows a period of extreme volatility (P21: 171, P23: 12, P26: 132). The carry-over insights correctly identified a lower mean (~62-75) but highlighted the massive range. The most recent 11 periods (P16-P26) represent the current high-volatility regime. The average demand in this period is 65.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 48.5 units. Because the lead time is 0, the OR backend's target base stock needs to account for (1+L) periods of demand, which happens after the decision phase. To prevent future stockouts in this high-variance environment, I will use recent_N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of this volatile regime while ignoring the earlier, more stable period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P15: P26 saw a spike to 132 units following several moderate periods, confirming that while the local mean is lower (~66), the potential for 100+ unit demand remains frequent.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a lower-mean regime that started around Period 16. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 111, following a demand of 132 in Period 26. These frequent spikes above 100 units, interspersed with very low demand periods (e.g., 12 units in P23), confirm that using a broad recent window is necessary to capture both the mean and the high standard deviation. The current inventory is 0 after two consecutive periods of stockouts (P26, P27). I will use a recent_N of 12 (covering Periods 16-27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full character of the current high-volatility regime (average demand ~68, but with spikes up to 171 and lows of 6). Given the 0-period lead time and high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), the OR backend will target a high service level (80%), which is appropriate given the current volatility and recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a significant upward shift in recent peaks. Period 28 saw a demand of 157, following 111 in Period 27 and 132 in Period 26. While the earlier post-P15 average was lower, the last three periods (P26-P28) average 133 units, suggesting a potential new high-demand regime or a temporary seasonal rally. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently realized as 0), the OR backend's single-period base stock logic will target a service level based on the profit/holding ratio (q = 4/5 = 80%). Given the current extreme volatility and the stockouts in the last three consecutive periods (P26, P27, P28), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this local high-demand/high-variance spike specifically. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the possibility of 150+ unit demand, mitigating frequent stockouts while acknowledging the inventory resets to zero each period due to 0-day lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Activity has spiked significantly from the previous ~65 average to a 3-period average of 133 units (P26: 132, P27: 111, P28: 157), resulting in consecutive stockouts despite high starting inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly starting at Period 26. The last four periods (P26-P29) have seen demands of 132, 111, 157, and 133, resulting in an average of approximately 133 units. This is a sharp increase from the previous 'low-mean' regime of ~65 units. Consecutive stockouts in P26, P27, and P28 demonstrate that the system was under-stocking for this new level of demand. I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new average of 133 units across the review+lead period (L+1=1). Lead time remains consistent at 0. Given the extreme volatility observed throughout the game (ranges from 6 to 171), I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to ensure a robust safety buffer, as the recent demand spike is sustained and high-volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high-mean (~133 units) from Period 26 onwards, replacing the previous low-mean (~65 units) regime. Volatility remains high.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-activity regime starting at Period 26. While the previous 3-period average (P26-P28) was ~133 units, the most recent two periods (P29-P30) show a slight cooling or high variance (133 and 81). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 123 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 29 units. The actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime while being responsive to the most recent fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean and the significant risk of stockouts observed in earlier periods of this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-mean, high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. Since the shift, demand observations have been 132, 111, 157, 133, 81, and 163. This averages approximately 129.5 units over the last 6 periods, with significant upward spikes (Period 28: 157, Period 31: 163). Despite a 0-period lead time, the system is stockout-prone because the current base stock logic is underestimating the required inventory level to cover this high-variance period. To stabilize service levels and capture the current demand mean, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 (capturing the regime from P26-P31). I am also using N=6 for sigma_hat to accurately account for the heightened volatility observed in this specific regime. Lead time (L) remains 0 (default) as same-period delivery is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed as sustained: post-P26 mean is ~130 units (up from previous ~65) with high volatility and peak demands reaching 160-170 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 26 to a high-mean, high-volatility regime. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged approximately 115.7 units (132, 111, 157, 133, 81, 163, 33) with very high variance (ranging from 33 to 163). In Period 32, demand dropped significantly to 33, leaving us with a healthy on-hand inventory of 123. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's mean while respecting the established high volatility, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the high-demand spikes (up to 163) observed since P26, preventing stockouts if demand rebounds, while recognizing the current inventory buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-mean regime that started around Period 26. After a multi-period stretch of high demand (averaging ~130 units), the last two periods (P32 and P33) have seen a dramatic but characteristic dip (33 and 5 units respectively). Given the 0-period lead time, the strategy is to maintain a high base stock to capture the inevitable spikes (which have reached up to 171 units) while minimizing holding costs during the troughs. The recent 8-period mean (P26-P33) is approximately 102 units, but this includes the current sharp dip. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to account for this recent high-volatility regime and the potential for a quick return to 130+ unit demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor post-P26: although the 8-period mean is ~102 units, the range is extreme (5 to 163), suggesting the high-mean regime (~130) is prone to temporary 1-2 period collapses before surging back.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a high-mean, high-volatility regime that started at Period 26, characterized by high peaks (up to 163 units) followed by sharp 2nd-order collapses (e.g., Periods 32-34 saw demands of 33, 5, and 18). Despite this recent lull, history (Periods 26-31) shows that surges back to >130 units are frequent and sudden. Current on-hand inventory is 133 units. Using a 9-period window (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entire post-P25 regime, encompassing both the high-demand spikes and the recent collapses. This results in a mu_hat reflective of the average (~92 units) but with a high sigma_hat due to the extreme variance (range 5-163). The L=0 lead time is stable. The OR backend will likely order a small replenishment if the base stock calculation exceeds the current 133 units, protecting against a return to the 150+ unit demand levels seen earlier in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 26 regime (P26-P34) shows a mean of ~92 units but extreme instability: demand cycles between surges (>130) and deep lulls (<35).

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 26 regime. Period 35 saw a massive spike to 144 units, perfectly utilizing all available stock and confirming that the 'deep lulls' (Periods 33-34) are temporary and followed by significant surges. The current mean since Period 26 is approximately 97 units, but the standard deviation remains very high (~57) due to the range of 5 to 163 units. With a 0-period lead time and a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 0.8), the goal is to set a base stock that covers these frequent surges. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (covering P26-P35) to capture this high-volatility, high-mean regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand data. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level closer to the 160-unit peak demand seen recently.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 26 regime. Period 36 demand was 92 units, following a spike of 144 in Period 35. The 11-period mean (P26-P36) is approximately 106 units, but the range (5 to 163) and high variance (StdDev ~55) are the primary challenges. Since the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (L=0 confirmed by all 'conclude' messages), the inventory needs to primarily cover the immediate period's demand. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the high-variance behavior of this current regime (P26-P36). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the frequent spikes while acknowledging the slightly lower average compared to the initial P26-P29 surge.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 26 regime (P26-P36) mean is ~106 units with extreme volatility (Standard Deviation ~55), characterized by swings between <20 and >160 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 26 regime. Recent demand values include a high of 144 (P35) followed by relatively lower values of 92 (P36) and 32 (P37). The 12-period average since P26 is approximately 100 units, but with a standard deviation exceeding 50. Given the 0-period lead time and the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the primary risk is stockouts during unexpected surges. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this high-volatility regime starting at Period 26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for both the ~100 unit mean and the significant variance (sigma), ensuring sufficient safety stock for potential spikes while minimizing holding costs for the currently inventory-rich position (113 on hand).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the sustained regime identified since Period 26. Recent demand observations (P35: 144, P36: 92, P37: 32, P38: 100) maintain an average of approximately 92 units over the last 4 periods, which align with the broader post-P26 mean of ~102-106 units noted in previous insights. The product has a 0-period lead time, meaning orders arrive within the current cycle to satisfy demand. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 80%. I am selecting a recent_N window of 13 (covering P26 to P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the full breadth of the current high-volatility regime, ensuring the base stock level accounts for both the mean (~102) and the high standard deviation (~55) to protect against spikes while minimizing excess holding costs during frequent lulls.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 26 regime. Recent demand values include 100 (P38) and 30 (P39), maintaining a pattern of large swings. The mean demand since the P26 regime shift (P26-P39) is approximately 101 units, but with a range of 5 to 163 and a high standard deviation (approx 52). Current on-hand inventory is 109 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock level that covers the potential for a high-demand spike (up to 160-170 units) to avoid stockouts, which have been frequent. Using a recent_N of 14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of this current high-volatility regime, allowing the OR backend to calculate a safety stock buffer appropriate for the observed variance while centering on the regime's average demand of ~101.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 26 regime. Period 40 demand spiked to 139 units, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. Over the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the mean demand is approximately 95 units, but the standard deviation is very high (~53 units) due to frequent swings between near-zero and >160 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the characteristics of this current high-volatility regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect both the moderate mean and the extreme variance. L remains 'default' (0).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since the regime shift at Period 26. In the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been [32, 100, 30, 139, 89], with a mean of 78 and a standard deviation of approximately 47. While the 'post-P26 average' was previously estimated higher (~106), the most recent window shows high fluctuations that can quickly drain inventory (e.g., P40 demand was 139 units leading to a stockout). Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, we need to maintain a base stock level that covers the high-end potential of this volatile demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the full picture of the post-P26 volatile regime (starting from Period 26 to 41), as this provides a stable mean and standard deviation estimate for the OR backend to set a sufficient safety buffer. This ensures we can satisfy the frequent surges (>130 units) while managing holding costs during the deep lulls.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the post-Period 26 regime. For the last 14 periods (P29-P42), the mean demand is approximately 84 units, but the range is massive (5 to 163). Recent demand in P40-P42 (139, 89, 76) shows a slight upward trend compared to the deep lulls seen in P33-P34. Given a 0-period lead time and high holding costs relative to profit (Ratio 1:4), we need to maintain a high enough base stock to cover frequent spikes above 130 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the mean of this current high-volatility regime (~84 units), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=14 to account for the high standard deviation (~48) observed in this period, ensuring the OR engine calculates an appropriate safety stock for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 26 regime (P26-P42) confirmed with lower mean than initially thought (~84 units) but sustained extreme volatility (Standard Deviation ~48), with demand frequently swinging between <35 and >130 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 remains characterized by a moderate mean (approximately 84 units) but extreme volatility, with demand frequently swinging between <20 and >160 units. As of Period 44, we are starting with 65 units on-hand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while balancing the holding cost (which is 25% of the unit profit), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 18 periods (P26-P43) which define the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance observed in this specific window.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the extreme volatility documented since Period 26. Period 44 saw a demand spike to 126 units, following several periods of moderate demand (~60-90 units). Since the promised lead time is 0, and actual lead times have consistently been 0, I will maintain L=0. For demand parameters, I am using the the last 19 periods (since the major regime shift in Period 26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the 'high-mean, high-volatility' nature of the current market state while smoothing out the extreme individual swings (ranging from 5 to 163). The mean for this period (P26-P44) is approximately 86 units with a standard deviation of approximately 49. By using these values, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will provide sufficient safety stock to cover frequent spikes above 130 units while minimizing holding costs during the occasional deep lulls.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the regime established around Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized near 85 units, but the variance is massive, with values ranging from 5 to 163. In the most recent five periods (P41-P45), demand was [89, 76, 60, 126, 72], averaging 84.6 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maximize reward while managing high volatility and a 0-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-P26 average and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient safety stock buffer (z-score for 80% service level) to cover frequent demand spikes without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues to exhibit the 'post-Period 26' regime characteristics: a Moderate mean (~85-90) coupled with extreme volatility. Period 46 demand was very low (18), which follows a period of moderate demand (72, 126). This confirms the pattern of sharp swings mentioned in Carry-Over Insights. Since the lead time is 0 periods, the OR engine needs to cover only the upcoming period's demand (L+1=1). However, the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) translates to a target service level of 80%, meaning we must buffer against the frequent spikes (often exceeding 130 units). I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the current regime mean which has stabilized around 84, and a similar recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the sustained high standard deviation (~48-50). The 'calculate' method for L is appropriate as lead time has been consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 26 regime. Recent demand values include P44: 126, P45: 72, P46: 18, and P47: 24. While the last few periods show a dip, the history of this regime suggests a sudden surge back to >130 units is highly probable. The 0-period lead time allows for responsive ordering, but the high volatility (Standard Deviation ~48-55) requires a significant buffer. I am using a recent_N approach with N=21 (the length of the current regime from P26 to P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance behavior while acknowledging the average demand has settled lower than the initial spike. Specifically, the mean of the P26-P47 regime is approximately 80-85 units, and N=21 provides the most accurate statistical footprint of the current distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. The current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit, following a significant stockout in Period 48 where demand reached a record high of 192 units against a starting inventory of 124. This confirms the 'extreme volatility' noted in the Carry-over Insights (Period 43), where demand swings between deep lulls (<25) and massive surges (>130). Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the goal is to stock for the immediate period. Given the recent average (approx. 84 units) but the high probability of another surge (max 192), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Balancing the service level (profit $4 vs holding cost $1, implying an 80% service level), I need to set mu_hat to cover the expected mean of the current volatile regime and sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance observed. The recent regime (P26-P48) has a mean of ~86 and a standard deviation of ~49. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the post-P26 regime) to capture this high-volatility behavior for the final periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another high-volatility phase. The last two periods (P48 and P49) saw massive spikes of 192 and 182 units, the highest in the entire history, resulting in stockouts. The inventory currently stands at 0. Since the lead time remains 0, I must order enough to cover the immediate demand of Period 50. Given the recent surge, a recent_N approach (N=7 to capture the run-up and recent spikes) is best for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the significantly increasing volatility (Standard Deviation has increased with these 180+ unit observations). This strategy aims to prevent another stockout during this current demand peak while recognizing the 0-period lead time allows for rapid adjustment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 48: Demand reached historical highs (192 and 182 units) back-to-back, significantly exceeding the previous 'high-mean' regime average of ~100-130 units. This indicates a new surge or further increased variance requiring higher base stock levels.
