Historical demand samples are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], which gives an average demand of approximately 111.4 units with a standard deviation of 17.1 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during Period 1 and be available for Period 1 demand (visible in Period 2 start). The OR recommendation is 127 units, calculated using the formula: base_stock (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) - pipeline. With Profit=$4.0 and Holding=$1.0, the critical fractile is 0.8, resulting in a safety factor z* \u2248 0.84.

This is intended to cover the immediate period's demand.\n4. **Final Strategy**: While the average is lower, the spike of 171 in P21 suggests that a stock level of 122 (OR's target) might be insufficient if another high-demand period occurs. However, because holding costs are $1 and profit is $4, the critical fractile is 0.8. Historical data shows demand exceeds 122 in about 14% of periods (3/22).

The average demand over the last three periods (P36-P38) is approximately 75 units, but the long-term historical mean remains higher (~94). The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all concluded transactions. Currently, on-hand inventory is 26 units. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 99 units, aiming for a base-stock level around 125 units (99 + 26). Given the profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), the critical fractile is 0.8, which justifies maintaining a robust safety stock to prevent stockouts during high-demand spikes (like the 144 units seen in P35 or 100 in P38).

My analysis of the last 6 periods (P36-P41) shows a 'high-low' demand oscillation: 92, 32, 100, 30, 139, 89. This yields an average of 80.3 units per period, with a specific pattern of large spikes (100+) followed by moderate to low demand. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is currently 0 after a significant demand spike of 192 units in Period 48. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available in the same period they are placed. The OR algorithm recommends 126 units based on historical data. Recent demand has been highly volatile: P45 (72), P46 (18), P47 (24), and P48 (192). The average demand over these last four periods is 76.5, but the spike in P48 is the highest recorded in the entire history. Given that this is Period 49 out of 50, the objective is to satisfy the final 2 periods of demand while minimizing ending inventory in Period 50. Since the order placed now will arrive immediately for Period 49 demand, and I can place another order in Period 50 for that period's demand, I should order enough to cover any reasonable spike in Period 49. The OR recommendation of 126 is sensible as it covers the long-term average plus a safety buffer, though it is lower than the recent spike. I will follow the OR recommendation of 126 units.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and a significant demand surge in recent periods. Demand for P48 and P49 reached 192 and 182 units respectively, which are the highest recordings in the history of this game. The carry-over insights confirm this upward shift and volatility. The OR recommendation of 129 units is based on a longer historical average and fails to account for this recent step-change in demand volume. Given the lead time is reliably 0 periods, I must ensure that the total available stock (on-hand + current order) is sufficient to cover these new peaks without incurring excessive holding costs if demand mean-reverts. With on-hand inventory currently at 0, ordering significantly above the OR recommendation is necessary to prevent a stockout. I will order 185 units, aligning with the actual demand observed over the last two periods.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increasing OR's 129 to 185 units to match the recent significant demand surge (192 and 182 units in P48-P49) and prevent stockouts.",
