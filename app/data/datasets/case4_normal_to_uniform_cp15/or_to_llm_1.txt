However, the cost of a stockout ($4 profit) vs. holding cost ($1) justifies a relatively high service level.

Given the massive spike in P48 (192) and the stockout, the OR recommendation of 126 is a safe middle-ground that balances potential high demand with the risk of high holding costs if demand returns to the low 20s. I will follow the OR recommendation of 126.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "In Period 50, 'chips(Regular)' has 0 on-hand inventory following two consecutive periods of very high demand (192 and 182). The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time for this period's demand. The OR baseline recommends 129 units, based on long-term historical averages. However, recent demand (P48-P49) has averaged 187 units, significantly higher than the OR's expected mean. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the penalty for a stockout is much higher than for carrying excess inventory. I will override the OR recommendation and order 180 units to cover the current high-demand spike while being mindful of the 126-unit cap usually suggested by recent ordering patterns.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR recommendation from 129 to 180 units to address the recent surge in demand (averaging 187 over the last 2 periods) and replenish empty on-hand inventory.",

    "chips(Regular)": 180
