Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no inventory on hand or in transit. The product description is 'chips(Regular)' and the initial history provided contains 5 demand points: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean demand is 111.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.9. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period and are available for demand resolution. To maximize reward, we need to cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline using all available historical data (5 samples). This will calculate a base stock level that accounts for the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) to satisfy expected demand while managing inventory risk.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 108. Combined with historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand is approximately 110.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.9. Since Period 1 demand (108) is consistent with this historical regime, I will use all 6 available samples (5 historical + 1 game period) to set the base stock parameters. With L=0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period (1+0 reviews). The current on-hand inventory is 19, and there are no units in transit. Using the full history (N=6) provides the most stable estimate given no evidence of a regime shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 5 historical samples was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean=111.4). In the first two game periods, demand was 108 and 74. While 74 is a bit lower, it's only one data point. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent history (including the game periods and the most recent pre-game samples) to capture current demand levels. Since lead time is consistently 0, I will use the 'default' method for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility, with samples of 108, 74, and 119 in the first three periods. The historical data (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) combined with observed demand suggests a mean demand of approximately 107.25 units per period. The observed actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is low at 8 units, necessitating a replenishing order. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (incorporating the 5 historical and 3 observed data points) to capture the current demand regime. L is set to 'default' as lead time is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-4 confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game data) has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with mean 111.4 and standard deviation 17.6. For the in-game periods 1-4, demand was [108, 74, 119, 124], which shows higher volatility. Period 4 ended with 0 inventory after satisfying all demand, so there is no carry-over. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as history matches the promise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (incorporating the most recent demand points) to capture the current volatility while maintaining a stable base stock calculation, ensuring we meet approximately 110-120 units of demand expected for Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout the first 5 periods (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51]. While Period 5 demand was lower (51 units), it follows a high-demand period (124). Given the limited history and lack of a clear sustained trend or seasonal signal (dates are generic Period_X), I will use the 'default' method for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5. This allows the backend to capture the most recent local average and standard deviation while smoothing out the outlier observed in Period 5. The base stock policy will inherently adjust for the current on-hand inventory of 70 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the product 'chips(Regular)' has a observed actual lead time of 0 periods across the first 6 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand data (including past demands: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and observed demand in the game: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67]) shows a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. However, demand in the last two periods (51 and 67) has been significantly lower than the historical average (approx. 110-120). This suggests a possible downward shift or high volatility. Given the 0-period lead time, the system is highly responsive. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the recent game performance while balancing the long-term history. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility observed in the last few periods (dropping from 124 to 51). L will remain at 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 7 periods, the average demand is 78.0 and the standard deviation is 27.6. Combined with the pre-game history (112, 97, 116, 138, 94; mean 111.4), we see a recent downward shift in demand mean starting from Period 2. The most recent three periods (P5-P7) show demands of 51, 67, and 103 (average 73.6), while the promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding. I will use recent_N (N=7 to capture the game history regime) for demand and standard deviation to better track the current variability and mean while the L=0 remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has shifted lower since the start of the game compared to pre-game history, averaging approximately 78 units per period over the last 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 1-8) shows a mean of 92.25 units, which is significantly lower than the pre-game data (mean ~111). However, Period 8 saw an uptick to 92 units from the previous regime average. Given the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently being met (observed lead time is always 0), I will continue using L=0. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full game history mean, as the pre-game samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) seem to represent a higher-demand state not currently present. Sigma_hat will also use the last 8 periods to reflect the current volatility of this lower-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 1-9) averages 93.1 units per period, which is lower than the pre-game history average of 111.4. Although Period 8 carry-over insights suggested a lower average of 78, the last three periods (Periods 7, 8, 9) have shown a return to higher demand levels (103, 92, 100, average = 98.3). Given the promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding true (confirmed through Period 9), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent stabilization around the 90-100 range while reacting to the lower mean observed earlier in the game compared to pre-game data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers expected demand for the current period without over-ordering based on older, higher data points.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized over the last 3 periods (P7-P9) at an average of 98.3 units, correcting the previous downward trend seen in Periods 5-6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 23 units with nothing in transit. Reviewing the lead time history from Periods 1-10, every order has arrived with an actual lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand history shows significant fluctuations: an initial high (P1-P4 avg: 106.25), a dip (P5-P6 avg: 59), and a recent recovery and stabilization (P7-P10 avg: 93.5). The last period (P10) demand was 79, while P9 was 100, and P8 was 92. Given the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights and the recent 4-period average of 93.5, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current stable demand level while ignoring the earlier extreme dip. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect current volatility. L remains default (0) as verified by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand was 122 units, which exceeded the total available stock (103 units), resulting in stockouts and an ending inventory of 0. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), demand has averaged 99.2 units, which is significantly higher than the average observed in P5-P6 (~59 units). This confirms that demand has returned to and slightly exceeded the level noted in the P10 Carry-Over Insight. Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 0 periods (which has been consistently accurate), I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the current period. I am using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime and ensure sufficient stock to meet the current demand uptick and avoid further stockouts. L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand has shifted back to a higher regime: the last 5 periods (P7-P11) average 99.2 units per period, compared to the lower regime (P5-P6) of ~59 units.

Daily Profit: $452.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 119 and we had a stockout (sold only 113), following a stockout in Period 11 as well. The last 6 periods (P7-P12) show a mean demand of 102.5 units (103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119). This is significantly higher than the previous low regime of ~59 in P5-P6. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture this stabilized higher demand level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 100+ units since Period 7, with the last 2 periods (P11-P12) showing peak demands (122, 119) leading to stockouts.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time (L) is consistently 0, which is confirmed by all previous 13 periods. Analysis of recent demand shows a clear regime shift since Period 7. While Periods 5-6 were low (avg 59), Periods 7-13 have averaged 102.8 units (103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119, 102). Stockouts occurred in Period 11 and 12, indicating that demand was potentially higher than the recorded sales. The latest Period 13 demand was 102. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stabilized higher demand regime (P7-P13), which provides a mean of ~102.8 per period. Since L=0, the target base stock (mu_hat) covers one period of demand (1+L=1). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the capture of recent volatility and mean without being skewed by the exceptionally low Period 5-6 dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high and stable: Period 7-13 mean is 102.8 units per period, consistently higher than the P5-P6 dip of ~59. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we experienced a stockout (demand 128, sold 115) resulting in an ending inventory of 0 for Period 15. The demand regime has clearly shifted higher since Period 7. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P7-P14) average 106.1 units per period, with a recent 4-period average (P11-P14) of 117.75 units. The lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the recent high-demand regime since P7 (N=8) to set my mean and standard deviation, ensuring mu_hat covers at least 106 units per period to prevent further stockouts. Using N=8 provides a robust sample size while excluding the earlier low-demand dip in P5-P6.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 7 has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 106.1 units per period compared to previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized higher regime since Period 7, with a mean of 106.6 units (P7-P15). Period 14 saw a peak demand of 128, which led to a stockout, and P15 demand remained high at 112. The historical promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by 'conclude' messages. To capture this sustained higher demand level while accounting for recent volatility (including the P11, P12, and P14 stockouts/peaks), I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9, covering the stable regime from P7 to P15. sigma_hat will also use N=9 to capture the variability from this same period. No evidence suggests a change in the lead time L=0, so the 'default' method is retained for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 7 to 15 has stabilized at a higher mean of 106.6 units, up from the early game average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 170 units, the highest recorded in the game, resulting in a stockout. The demand regime since Period 7 had stabilized around 106.6 units, but the last few periods (P14: 128, P15: 112, P16: 170) suggest an increasing trend or higher volatility. Given the stockout and the recent jump, I will calculate mu_hat using N=10 to capture the higher regime established since Period 7 (mean of P7-P16 is approximately 113.8). I will use N=10 for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation is significantly higher due to the 170 peak). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike confirmed: Period 16 reached 170 units, the highest in history. The average demand from Period 7 to 16 has increased to 112.8 units (compared to 106.6 reported previously).

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout due to a massive and sudden surge in demand. Period 16 demand was 170, and Period 17 demand spiked to 213, resulting in stockouts for both periods (sold=120 and 134 respectively). The demand regime has shifted significantly from the Period 7-15 average of ~107 units to a much higher level (avg of last 2 periods is 191.5). I will use a high forecast to capture this momentum and recover service levels. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' forecast based on the most recent demand spike (213) to ensure the base stock calculation targets a level capable of fulfilling these new peak demands, while maintaining L as 'default' (0) as verified by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked from an average of ~107 (P7-P15) to 170 (P16) and 213 (P17), indicating a potential new peak season or structural shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $579.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 170, 213, and 166 units, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~107. The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. To capture this surge and maintain service levels while accounting for the recent slight drop from 213 to 166, I am using a recent_N approach. I've chosen N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus exclusively on this new high-demand regime (P16, P17, P18). This prevents the lower historical demand from pulling down our base stock calculation, which is critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (recommending a 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime since Period 16 confirmed: mean demand over P16-P18 is 183 units, significantly higher than the P7-P15 average of 107 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $820.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting at Period 16. The demand values for P16 to P19 are 170, 213, 166, and 231, resulting in a mean of 195 units per period for this 4-period window. This is a dramatic increase from the P7-P15 average of ~107. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. To avoid stockouts and capture the profit from this high-demand surge, I am setting L to default (0). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the mean of 195 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to account for the increased volatility in this new high-demand regime. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current market behavior while the backend's internal logic handles the units needed to reach that target.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-19 mean demand is 195.0 units, compared to the previous Period 7-15 mean of 106.6 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a distinct high-volume regime starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent periods (P16 to P20), demand values are 170, 213, 166, 231, and 198. The mean of these last 5 periods is 195.6, which is vastly higher than the pre-P16 average of ~107. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the high demand volatility in this new regime (std dev approx 26.5), the OR engine needs to set a higher base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in periods 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 19. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior specifically. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+0)*195.6 = 195.6 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1)*std(P16-P20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 20 has stabilized at a high levels, averaging 195.6 units per period, compared to the previously established mean of 106.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $745.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant structural shift starting around Period 16. In the most recent period (P21), demand was 193, following a sequence of 198, 231, 166, 213, and 170. This confirms a high-demand regime. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 21 (N=6) is approximately 195.1 units, with a standard deviation indicating heightened volatility (approx 23 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders placed today arrive immediately to satisfy today's demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-demand regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the current peak and mitigate frequent stockouts observed earlier in this regime. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock using these parameters to balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P21) mean confirmed at 195.1 units per period, representing a ~83% increase over the previous stable mean of 106.6 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand is 192.4 units, which is significantly higher than the previous stable average of 106.6 units observed between Periods 7 and 15. The recent demand samples are [170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176]. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (order and arrival occur in the same period). To capture this sustained regime shift and ensure sufficient base stock to cover demand (1+L where L=0), I will use the recent_N method based on the last 7 periods (N=7). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock using the mean and standard deviation of this high-demand era, optimizing for the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P22) mean recalculated at 192.4 units per period across the last 7 periods; lead time remains 0.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting from Period 16. In the most recent period (P23), demand spiked to 243 units, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), the mean demand is approximately 198.75 units, significantly higher than the earlier game average. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this increased volume and volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this specific high-demand regime. Using N=8 (the exact length of the high-demand period) ensures the OR system uses the most relevant mean and standard deviation. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0, so the 'default' method is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) mean recalculated at 198.8 units per period across the last 8 periods; volatility remains high with a peak of 243 units in P23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent period (P16 to P24), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 198.3 units per period (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195). Prior to Period 16, demand was consistently much lower (approx. 107 units). The current period (P25) starts with 28 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this high-demand regime while accounting for the significant volatility (standard deviation remains high with peaks up to 243), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to encompass the entire current high-demand regime (P16-P24). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the elevated mean and variance observed over these 9 periods, ensuring sufficient stock for the next high-demand realization while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P24) mean stabilized at 198.3 units per period, a 86% increase over the previous stable mean (P7-P15) of 106.6 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 198.0 units per period. The most recent demand (P25) was 185 units, following a sequence of high demands (170, 213, 166, 231, 198, 193, 176, 243, 195, 185). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime while accounting for the significant volatility (ranging from 166 to 243 in this regime), I will use the last 10 samples (representing the high regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to cover the elevated demand mean and its associated variance, minimizing stockouts which have occurred recently (P16, P17, P19, P23).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P25) mean is 198.0 units per period, with a standard deviation significantly higher than early-game periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains significantly higher (averaging 198.3 units) than the previous periods, with recent demand in Period 26 at 188 units. I will continue to focus on the last 11 samples (P16-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captured the shift. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. The profit/holding cost ratio suggests a service level (q) of 0.8, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters to maintain sufficient inventory while minimizing holding costs. On-hand inventory is currently at 31 units with no in-transit units, and the backend order logic will aim to bring this to the targeted base stock.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 199.1 units over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). Period 27 demand of 219 units resulted in a stockout, ending with 0 inventory. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the current high demand and prevent further stockouts while accounting for volatility (standard deviation is roughly 25 units in this regime), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time (L) is set to 0 to match observed behavior.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P27) mean is 199.1 units per period, with sustained high volatility; lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is approximately 199.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8 units. The most recent demand observations (P27: 219, P28: 213) suggest that demand remains at the upper end of this regime. Lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To minimize stockouts given the low on-hand inventory (6 units) and the high volatility observed in this regime, I will use a conservative recent_N approach. I'll set N=13 to cover the entire high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current mean (approx. 199) and volatility (approx. 23). This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the expected 200+ units of same-period demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting at Period 16. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 199.3 units, significantly higher than the early game average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 29, the demand was 215 units, following a string of high demand values (219, 213, 215). I will use a recent window (N=14) to capture this stable 'high' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=14 covers the entire high-demand period, providing a solid mean and capturing the increased volatility (standard deviation) seen recently to maintain an appropriate service level. Lead time L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P29) mean is 199.3 units per period; volatility remains elevated compared to early game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently high-demand regime since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 15 periods (P16-P30) calculated at 201.3 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been even more stable and slightly higher, averaging 210 units (188, 219, 213, 215, 215). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is approximately 80%, but with a same-period arrival (L=0), the critical priority is having enough stock to meet the immediate period's demand. To capture the recent stability around the 210-215 unit mark and account for the high volatility observed within this regime (standard deviation ~20-25), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained peak levels while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in earlier periods of this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P30) mean is 201.3 units, with a more recent stabilization (P26-P30) at 210.0 units per period. Volatility remains high but consistent within this peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift starting at Period 16, which has been sustained through Period 31. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 30 was approximately 201 units, but Period 31 saw a record high demand of 276 units, leading to a stockout. This indicates that while the regime is stable at a high level, the volatility is increasing or we are entering an even higher demand peak. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize reward and prevent further stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility environment, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 16 periods (P16-P31) to capture this elevated regime while effectively budgeting for the increased variance seen in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 31 averages 206.0 units per period. Period 31 reached a new peak of 276 units, indicating increasing volatility within the high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $699.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 16-32 is confirmed as high and volatile, with a mean of approximately 206 units. Historically, the demand peaked at 276 in Period 31, followed by a decrease to 186 in Period 32. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0, critical ratio q = 0.8), the backend will naturally aim for a higher service level. I will use the last 17 periods (P16-P32) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. By providing the statistics for the entire high-demand regime, the OR backend can better estimate the variance needed to cover potential spikes like the one seen in P31.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained in a high-demand state since Period 16, averaging approximately 205.7 units per period from P16 to P33. Recent demand (P31-P33) shows continued volatility, with a significant peak of 276 units in P31 followed by a return to approximately 184 units in P32-P33. Given the Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the goal is to set mu_hat to cover the current period's expected high demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent volatility observed (last 5 periods mean is ~214, but last 18 periods mean is ~206). I will use recent_N with N=18 (the start of the high-demand regime at P16) to provide a stable yet elevated mean estimate, and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance seen in this same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift that began around Period 16. In the most recent block (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 199.5 units. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34), demand shows some stabilization/slight easing with values [215, 276, 186, 182, 171], averaging 206.0. The volatility remains significant (standard deviation is high), justifying a decent buffer to prevent stockouts, especially considering the peak of 276 in P31. I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture the entire high-demand regime since Period 16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the current structural environment better than the full history or just the last few volatile periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P34) mean is 199.5 units; recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is 206.0 units despite a slight downward trend in the last 3 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of 199.5 units. Over the most recent 10-period window (P26-P35), demand has averaged approximately 205.3 units. While there was a slight dip between P32-P34 (averaging ~180), Period 35 saw demand jump back to 222 units, suggesting the high-demand regime remains intact though volatile. Since the profit ($4) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal to avoid stockouts, which have occurred twice in the last 10 periods (P27, P31). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages. I will use the recent 20-period demand history (N=20) to capture the high-demand regime statistics since its onset around P16, while allowing for the natural volatility observed (e.g., the 276 peak in P31).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains active through Period 35: 10-period average (P26-P35) is 205.3 units, maintaining the structural shift observed since Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $908.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established since Period 16 remains active. Recent demand history shows significant volatility: Period 31 (276), Period 35 (222), and Period 36 (240) indicate that demand continues to fluctuate between 170 and 270+ units. The last period (P36) resulted in a stockout (demand 240 vs on-hand 227). Based on the 21-period high-demand regime (P16-P36), the mean is approximately 201 units. However, looking at the most recent 6 periods (P31-P36) which include the recent peaks, the mean is 212.8. To ensure sufficient service levels in the face of this high volatility and recent stockout, I will use recent_N with N=21 to capture the full scope of the high-demand regime for mu_hat, while using default sigma_hat to account for the increased standard deviation observed in this period range. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains active through Period 36. The average demand from P16 to P36 is 201.2 units per period, with significant peaks (e.g., P31: 276, P36: 240) causing recurring stockouts when inventory is not set aggressively.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains active. Calculating stats since this structural shift (P16-P37), the mean demand is approximately 201.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.8. Recent periods (P31-P37) show continued high volatility, with demand peaking at 276. In Period 37, demand was 196, leaving 33 units on hand. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently actualized (confirmed by Period 37 conclude). I will use recent_N with N=22 to capture the entire high-demand regime since Period 16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the overall high mean with the observed volatility to maintain a high service level, which is optimal given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the high-regime established at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units since that shift. Recently, periods 31-38 have shown a mix of high peaks (276, 240) and moderate results (170, 171, 182), maintaining a high mean with significant volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 58 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. To maximize reward while avoiding the stockouts seen in Periods 31 and 36, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 23 periods (P16-P38) to capture the full scope of this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected high mean and volatility. Historical lead time has consistently been 0, so L is set to 'calculate'.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a high-demand regime since Period 16, following a structural shift from the early-game average (~107) to a significantly higher mean. Examining the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 201.7 units, despite some fluctuations (min 170, max 276). The last three periods (P37-P39) show a slight cooling with demands of 196, 170, and 171 respectively, but volatility remains high enough to warrant a robust safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as confirmed by every conclude message. I will use recent_N (N=24, matching the length of the high-demand regime from P16 to P39) to capture the current mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained high-demand period while remaining sensitive to the extreme peaks (like P31's 276) that have caused stockouts in the past. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains stable from P16 through P39, with a 24-period mean of 200.2 units. Recent periods (P37-P39) show a slight decrease in demand volume (avg 179) compared to the regime average, but variance remains high.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for chips(Regular) remains in the high demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 through Period 40 is approximately 199.1 units. While there was a slight dip in demand between Periods 37-39 (averaging 179 units), Period 40 saw a return to higher demand at 223 units, suggesting the regime is still active and volatile. On-hand inventory is nearly zero (2 units), necessitating a full restock. Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 (covering the regime from P16-P40) to capture the average and volatility of this structural shift while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean around 200 units and significant variance. Period 41 concluded with a demand of 226 units, resulting in zero ending inventory. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 194.7 units, and over the the longer high-regime window (P16-P41), it is 201.2 units. Given the high volatility (peaks like P31 at 276 and P36 at 240), an aggressive base stock is required to prevent lost sales, which carry a higher penalty ($4.0 profit) than the $1.0 holding cost. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the last 26 periods (the entire high-demand regime starting from Period 16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR engine captures the full breadth of the current structural shift and its associated volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean around 200 units. Recent demand (P41-P42) of 226 and 219 confirms this trend remains strong. Since the profit is $4.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which justifies holding enough safety stock to cover demand peaks (like the 276 units seen in P31 or 240 in P36). The lead time is consistently 0. I will use the most recent 27 periods (P16 to P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this entire high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand noise. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that minimizes stockouts while managing the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P42) remains stable with a mean of 200.7 units and high volatility; lead time is strictly 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a confirmed mean of approximately 200.7 units (P16-P42). Recent demand (P40-P43) remains consistent with this regime (223, 226, 219, 176). The promised and actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. To maximize reward given the $4 profit and $1 holding cost, a service level of 80% (4 / (4+1)) is the theoretical target, but the OR backend's capped policy and the high volatility (e.g., peak demand of 276 in P31) suggest using a demand window that captures this high-regime behavior without over-reacting to single-period dips. I will use 'recent_N' with N=28 (covering the start of the regime shift at P16 to the most recent period P43) to provide a stable estimate of the current high-demand mean and variance, ensuring the 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the structural shift while the lead time remains at the default (0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains active. Calculating the recent demand statistics from this regime (P16-P44) shows a mean of approximately 201 units. Recent history (P40-P44) shows demand fluctuations between 176 and 226, with an average of 210 over the last 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (18 units). Given the lead time is consistently 0, the backend OR logic will target the base stock level immediately. To capture the full magnitude of the high-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach with N=29 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16 to P44) to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained structural shift and elevated variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P44) maintained with a mean of 200.8 units per period; volatility remains high with frequent demand spikes exceeding 220 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and significant volatility (spikes up to 276 units). Within this regime, the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45) show a mean of 203.3 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying an 80% service level target), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average to capture the current stabilization. I will use the recent_N method for sigma_hat with N=30 (covering the high-demand regime) to adequately capture the observed volatility and prevent stockouts during demand spikes.

chips(Regular): ordered=204, arrived=204 units (ordered on Period 46, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=226, demand=208, sold=208, ending on-hand inventory=18
Daily Profit: $832.00, Daily Holding Cost: $18.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a high level with an average of approximately 201 units. Period 46 demand was 208 units, which aligns with this high-demand regime. Inventory levels are currently low (on-hand: 18), but lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To manage the high volatility (recent peak of 276 in P31 and consistent spikes above 220), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=31 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime starting from P16. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a sufficient safety buffer to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $900.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a long-term mean of 200.7 (P16-P47). Recent demand (P45-P47) has stayed high at 204, 208, and 231, resulting in a stockout in Period 47. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this high but volatile demand and restore inventory levels after the Period 47 stockout, I will use a recent_N window of 32 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16-P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable estimate of the high mean and the elevated variance required to manage demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime remains stable from P16 through P47, with a 32-period mean of 201.6 units and high volatility (peak 276).

Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the high-demand regime that started at Period 16. The demand remains stable but volatile, with a 33-period mean (P16-P48) of 201.8 units and a recent 5-period average (P44-P48) of 211.8 units. The last period (P48) saw a demand of 208 units, which is consistent with this regime. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high service level target (critical ratio ~0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 33 periods (N=33) to capture the full volatility and level of this sustained high-demand regime (since P16). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and protects against stockouts as we enter the final two periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $894.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50 (the final period), we are managing chips(Regular). The demand history since Period 16 has established a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 201.6 units and high volatility (standard deviation remains significant with peaks up to 276). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P46-P49) have seen demands of 208, 231, 208, and 224, averaging 217.75 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. The current on-hand inventory is 2 units. Since this is the final decision phase, the objective is to maximize profit for the final demand realization occurring after this decision. I will set the lead time L to 0 (promised). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent window of 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand level and volatility accurately, as the high-demand regime is stable but contains significant variance. This will ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet Period 50 demand while accounting for the high service level (80% based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost).
