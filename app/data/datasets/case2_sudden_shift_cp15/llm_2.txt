  "rationale": "In Period 1, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to meet demand within this same period. Based on the historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the average demand is approximately 111.4 units per period. Since this is 'Regular' chips, demand is likely stable barring specific calendar events. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs, I need to cover the current period's demand (since arrivals happen before demand resolution). I will target the higher end of the historical range to avoid stockouts on the first day, especially since I start with zero inventory. Ordering 125 units provides a buffer above the average to capture potential demand spikes while keeping holding costs manageable.",

Lead time is reliably 0, as confirmed by 17 consecutive periods of same-day arrivals.

To meet Period 18 demand and prevent a third consecutive stockout, I will order 250 units.
