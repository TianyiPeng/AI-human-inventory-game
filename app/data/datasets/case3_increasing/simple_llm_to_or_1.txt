Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand data provided for chips(Regular) shows values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average of these five periods is 111.4, with a standard deviation of approximately 17.0. No specific calendar dates or seasonal events are provided for 'Period 1', so the forecast relies on the central tendency of the historical data. The most recent observation (94) is lower than the average, but there is no confirmed downward trend yet (the previous value was a peak of 138). Given the volatility, a forecast close to the historical mean is most appropriate to minimize error.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for chips(Regular) shows a mean demand of approximately 111 units with a standard deviation of about 17. The most recent training observation was 94. However, the first period of the test phase (Period 1) recorded a demand of 91 units, which is slightly below the historical average but within the expected range. Given the relative stability and slight decline in the last two observations (94 and 91), the forecast for Period 2 will stay near this recent baseline while accounting for the historical mean. No significant seasonal or calendar drivers are currently identified for 'Period 2'.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for chips(Regular) showed a stable average of approximately 111.4 units (range 94-138). However, observed demand in the testing phase shows a massive surge in Period 2 (246 units) compared to Period 1 (91 units). This represents a 170% increase. While the training mean was around 111, Period 2 suggests a significant regime shift or a specific event-driven spike. Without specific calendar context (like a major holiday or sporting event frequently associated with chips), I must weigh the most recent observation heavily while acknowledging the volatility. I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially regress slightly from the Period 2 peak toward a new higher mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for chips(Regular) showed a stable demand mean around 111. However, the observed demand in the test phase (Periods 1-3) reveals a significant regime shift. Period 1 started at 91, but Periods 2 and 3 saw a massive jump to 246 and 285 respectively. This suggests either a new baseline (average ~265 over the last two periods) or a sharp upward trend. Given the product 'chips(Regular)' and the lack of specific calendar event names, I am treating this as a sustained shift in demand level. The forecast for Period 4 leans toward the recent high-demand level, assuming the new regime persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: avg demand increased from ~111 to ~265 (+138%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1416.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) showed a stable baseline around 100-112 in training, but the test phase reveals a significant upward shift. Following Period 1 (91 units), demand escalated to 246 (P2), 285 (P3), and spiked to 437 (P4). This indicates a strong upward trend or an accelerating demand regime shift. The average of the last three periods is approximately 322, but the most recent jump from 285 to 437 (+53%) suggests momentum. While the Carry-over Insight from Period 4 noted a shift to ~265, the subsequent 437 reading suggests the peak has not yet stabilized. I will forecast a slight cooling from the massive spike in P4 but maintain a high level consistent with the new growth trajectory, targeting the upper range of recent activity.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed accelerating upward trend: average demand increased from ~100 to ~322 over the last 3 periods, with a significant peak of 437 in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1754.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear and sustained upward regime shift starting in Period 2. After initial stable demand around 91-112 units (historical vs Period 1), the demand jumped to the mid-200s and has since accelerated. Specifically, the last two periods (Period 4 and 5) have stabilized at a much higher level (437 and 448 units), representing a New Normal compared to the early stages. The growth rate between Period 4 and 5 has slowed (from 285->437 previously), suggesting the trend might be leveling off at this new high plateau. I will forecast a slight continued increase to account for the momentum, centering the prediction around the 450-460 range.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed at Period 5: Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime (avg ~442 over last 2 periods), up significantly from the Period 2-3 average of ~265.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong, accelerating upward trend. Historically, the demand started at 91 (Period 1), jumped to a mid-200s range (Periods 2-3), then surged to the mid-400s (Periods 4-5), and most recently hit 587 (Period 6). The increase from Period 5 to 6 (+139 units) is the largest absolute jump yet. Given the consistent momentum and lack of evidence for a ceiling, I expect the demand to continue its upward trajectory. Applying a growth factor similar to recent steps while accounting for potential stabilization, I forecast the next period around 650.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth trend confirmed through Period 6: Demand has increased for five consecutive periods, with the average jumping from ~442 (P4-5) to 587 (P6), representing a ~33% increase in the most recent period.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong, sustained upward trend over the last seven periods. Starting from 91 units in Period 1, the demand has increased consecutively every single week. Specifically, the growth in the most recent periods has been: P4(437), P5(448), P6(587), and P7(637). The absolute increase between P6 and P7 was 50 units (~8.5%). Given the consistent momentum and the Carry-over Insights confirming a hyper-growth trend, the forecast for Period 8 should reflect a continuation of this trajectory. I am projecting a similar absolute increase to the previous period, placing the estimate around 685-690 units.

Carry-over insight: Consistent hyper-growth confirmed through Period 7: Demand has increased for seven consecutive periods, with the average of the last three periods (557) being significantly higher than the previous three (390), a 42.8% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3020.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and powerful upward trend for eight consecutive periods. Analyzing the recent growth: Period 5 (448), Period 6 (587, +31%), Period 7 (637, +8.5%), and Period 8 (776, +21.8%). The average absolute increase over the last three periods is approximately 109 units per period. The last observation of 776 shows no signs of saturation or mean reversion. Given that demand has almost tripled from Period 3 to Period 8, I am projecting a continuation of this hyper-growth. Applying a growth increment consistent with the recent moving average of increases (~105-115 units), the forecast for Period 9 is set at 890 units.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth trajectory sustained through Period 8: Demand has increased for eight consecutive periods, with the average of the last three periods (666) representing a 35% increase over the preceding three (490). Recent absolute weekly growth is averaging ~110 units.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a clear, sustained hyper-growth phase. Over the last 9 periods, demand has increased consistently every single week. Specifically, looking at the most recent periods: P6 (587), P7 (637), P8 (776), and P9 (963). The absolute increases between these periods have been 50, 139, and 187 units respectively, showing an accelerating growth curve rather than a linear one. The growth rate from P8 to P9 alone was ~24%. Given this acceleration, I expect demand to break the 1000-unit mark. Applying a slightly more conservative growth increment than the most recent surge (around +150-160 units) leads to a forecast in the 1120 range.

Carry-over insight: Accelerating hyper-growth confirmed: Demand has increased for 9 consecutive periods, with the growth rate itself increasing; the most recent jump (P8 to P9) was 187 units (+24%), compared to the previous average growth of ~110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2947.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained and aggressive hyper-growth trend for nine consecutive periods, peaking at 963 in Period 9. However, Period 10 shows the first sign of a deceleration or correction, with demand dropping to 863 (-10.3%). This break in the consecutive growth streak suggests either a seasonal peak has been passed or the system is entering a high-volume stabilization phase. Given the historical volatility and the magnitude of the recent drop, the forecast assumes a slight stabilization or partial recovery rather than a return to hyper-growth. I am weighting the most recent decline significantly, expecting demand to hover around the 850-900 range.

Carry-over insight: End of 9-period growth streak at Period 10: Demand decreased for the first time since Period 1, dropping from 963 to 863 (-10%), signaling a potential transition from hyper-growth to a high-volume plateau.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown unprecedented growth from Period 1 through 9.

The drop in Period 10 appears to have been a temporary variance rather than a permanent regime shift or plateau. Given the historical pattern of 50-150 unit increases during growth phases, and the strong momentum from the Period 11 peak, I am forecasting a continued upward trajectory while acknowledging the inherent volatility at these high volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth resumption at Period 11: After a single-period dip in Period 10, demand reached a new all-time high of 1136, confirming that the upward trend remains intact with the current average of the last 3 periods (988) being 31% higher than the avg of Periods 6-8 (666).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory. Following a brief correction in Period 10 (863 units), demand rebounded sharply in Period 11 (1136) and reached a new record high in Period 12 (1221). The trend analysis shows that excluding the Period 10 dip, recent growth cycles have averaged increases of approximately 100-180 units per period. The jump from P11 to P12 was 85 units (+7%). Given the momentum and the product type (snack food), which often sees compounding growth once a market foothold is established, I expect another increase. I am forecasting a moderated growth step of approximately 100 units above the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-velocity growth confirmed: Demand has recovered from the Period 10 dip to set two consecutive all-time highs, with the average of Period 11-12 (1178) being 32% higher than the Period 8-10 average (867).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained hyper-growth phase. Since the brief correction in Period 10 (863 units), demand has reached three consecutive all-time highs: Period 11 (1136), Period 12 (1221), and Period 13 (1246). While the growth rate is decelerating slightly (P11-P12 jumped 85 units, P12-P13 jumped 25 units), the trend remains clearly positive. Over the last three periods, the average demand is 1201 units, significantly higher than the previous three-period average of 867 (P8-P10). Given the consistent upward momentum and the standard behavior of chips as a staple snack product during a growth phase, I expect a continued but more moderate increase for Period 14, targeting a slight increment over the last peak.

Carry-over insight: Continued growth trajectory post-correction: Demand has reached three consecutive all-time highs since Period 10, with the Period 11-13 average (1201) being 38% higher than the Period 8-10 average (867).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent long-term upward trajectory. Following a brief dip in Period 10 (863 units), demand resumed its growth, hitting successive all-time highs from Period 11 to Period 14 (1136, 1221, 1246, 1265). However, the rate of growth is decelerating: the period-over-period increases have slowed from 7.5% (P11 to P12) to 2.0% (P12 to P13) and finally to 1.5% (P13 to P14). This suggests the product is transitioning from a 'hyper-growth' phase into a high-volume steady state or a mature growth phase. Given the recent average absolute increment of ~19 units over the last two periods, I expect a modest increase for Period 15, aligning with the current trend of diminishing marginal returns.

Carry-over insight: Growth deceleration phase confirmed: The Period 12-14 period-over-period growth rate has slowed from ~7.5% to ~1.5%, indicating a transition from hyper-growth to a high-volume steady state near the 1250-1300 unit range.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term upward trajectory. While Period 15 showed a significant jump to 1507 units (+19% over Period 14), recent trends from Periods 12-14 suggested a 'growth deceleration' and stabilization phase around the 1200-1300 range. However, the unexpected spike in Period 15 breaks that stabilization, potentially indicating a new growth spurt or a localized peak. Looking at the sequence, demand has historically shown strong momentum, but the sharp increase from 1265 to 1507 is the largest absolute period-over-period increase (242 units) since Period 11. Given the historical pattern of growth followed by slight moderation or plateaus (e.g., Period 10), it is likely that Period 16 will see a slight pullback or stabilization rather than another massive jump, though it should stay well above the old 1250 plateau due to the established momentum.

Carry-over insight: Momentum shift at Period 15: Demand broke out of the 1200-1300 plateau, reaching 1507 (+19%), signaling that the previously identified 'growth deceleration' has been overridden by a new surge in volume.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant long-term upward trend throughout the 16 periods. After a brief plateau between Periods 12-14 (ranging 1221-1265), there was a major breakout in Period 15 to 1507 units. Recent demand shows Period 15 at 1507 units and Period 16 at 1547 units, an increase of 40 units (+2.6%). This suggests that while the hyper-growth rate of earlier periods has moderated, momentum remains positive within a new high-volume regime. The forecast for Period 17 expects a continuation of this steady growth, projecting a similar absolute increase to match the most recent period-over-period change.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a 1200-1300 plateau to a 1500+ regime starting Period 15, with an average of 1527 over the last 2 periods (+22% vs previous 3-period average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6606.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a continuation of an aggressive upward trend. Period 17 saw a demand of 1724 units, which is a significant jump (+11.4%) from Period 16 (1547). This follows a 'Period 15' breakout from the previous 1200-1300 plateau. Analyzing the last 5 periods (1246, 1265, 1507, 1547, 1724), there is a clear acceleration. The average period-over-period growth for the last three periods is approximately 11%. However, the absolute increases in units (+242, +40, +177) suggest a volatile but sustained upward movement. Given the momentum and the confirmed shift to a 1500+ regime, I expect demand to continue rising. I am forecasting a moderated increase to account for potential saturation or natural variance, targeting the ~1800-1850 range.

Carry-over insight: Acceleration of high-volume regime confirmed: Moving from a 1500+ regime to a potential 1700+ regime, with Period 17 average weekly demand increasing 13% over the Period 15-16 average (1527 to 1724).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained hyper-growth pattern. Following a brief plateau around Periods 12-14 (avg ~1244), demand broke out into a new 1500+ regime at Period 15 and has accelerated further in recent periods. The last four periods (P15-P18) have shown consistent growth (1507 -> 1547 -> 1724 -> 1802). The most recent period-over-period growth was ~4.5% (increase of 78 units). Given the carry-over insights confirming an accelerating high-volume regime and the lack of structural evidence for a slowdown, I am forecasting a continuation of this trend. Calculating based on the recent moving average growth rate (~5%) and absolute volume increases (~80 units), the projected demand for Period 19 is approximately 1880.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth in high-volume regime: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P15-P18), rising from 1507 to 1802, with the avg of the last two periods (1763) being 15% higher than the preceding two (1527).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive hyper-growth trajectory. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has grown from 1507 to 2075 units without a single downward correction. The most recent jump from Period 18 (1802) to Period 19 (2075) represents a significant +15.1% increase (+273 units), which is much higher than the average growth rate of the previous three periods (~9%). This suggests that the 'high-volume regime' identified in previous insights is not just sustaining but accelerating again. Given the historical pattern of 5-15% weekly increases during growth phases, I am forecasting a continued upward movement. A conservative growth estimate of ~10% on the last observation (2075) leads to a forecast of approximately 2282.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth acceleration at Period 19: Demand exceeded the 2000-unit threshold for the first time, with a 15% WoW increase (from 1802 to 2075), significantly higher than the 6-7% growth seen in the preceding two periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has followed a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, with demand increasing nearly 22x from Period 1 to Period 19. Recently, Period 20 showed a demand of 1973, which is a -4.9% decline relative to Period 19's peak of 2075. Looking back at the historical pattern, a similar correction occurred at Period 10 (falling -10% after 9 periods of growth), which was immediately followed by a resumption of the upward trend. Currently, the average of the last 3 periods is 1950, and the demand appears to be consolidating in the 1950-2100 range after the Period 19 surge. Given the product is a staple snack ('chips'), and the historical behavior shows growth often resumes shortly after a minor correction, I anticipate the demand will stabilize or slightly recover as it finds a new support level above 2000.

Carry-over insight: Minor correction at Period 20 (-5%) following a 5-period growth streak (P15-P19), mirroring the Period 10 correction. Demand remains in a high-volume regime with an average of 1950 over the last three periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a long-term upward trajectory with periodic consolidation phases. After reaching a peak of 2075 in Period 19, demand underwent a minor correction in Period 20 (1973) and transitioned into a stabilization phase in Period 21 (1983). Historically, such corrections (similar to Period 10) have been brief pauses before the broader growth trend resumes. The current 2-period moving average is 1978, while the 3-period average is 2010. Given the slight uptick in Period 21 from Period 20, I forecast a moderate return toward the 2000-unit mark as the product resumes its upward momentum.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, characterized by periodic corrections followed by new all-time highs. Following the 'minor correction' period observed between Periods 20 and 21 (where demand stabilized around 1970-1980 units), Period 22 saw a significant breakout to a new record of 2221 units, representing a 12% WoW increase. This pattern of consolidation followed by a jump mirrors previous shifts seen in Periods 10-12 and 14-16. Given the current momentum and the historical trend where a breakout usually leads to at least one further consecutive increase or a sustained higher plateau, I expect demand to grow further. Calculating the recent growth slope (approx. 10-12% post-consolidation), a forecast in the 2350-2450 range is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth breakout at Period 22: Demand exited the ~1980 unit plateau with a 12% increase to 2221, confirming the upward trend remains intact despite the Period 20-21 correction.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and sustained hyper-growth trend. Following the Period 20-21 correction (avg ~1978), the last two periods (Period 22 and 23) have shown a significant resumption of growth, rising from 2221 to 2326 units. This represents a period-over-period growth rate of approximately 4.7%. Historical patterns for this SKU frequently show multi-period growth streaks followed by brief one-to-two period plateaus or minor corrections. Given the momentum from the last two periods and the consistent long-term upward trajectory, I expect demand to follow the current growth vector. Projecting a similar 4-5% increase from Period 23 results in a forecast of approximately 2430 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-correction growth: Following the Period 20-21 stabilization, demand has entered a new growth phase (P22-P23), increasing from ~1980 to an average of 2273 (+14.8%), confirming the long-term hyper-growth trajectory remains active.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a sustained hyper-growth trajectory. Following the minor stabilization period at P20-P21 (~1980 units), demand has accelerated again over the last three periods (P22-P24), reaching a new all-time high of 2566 in P24. The absolute growth in the most recent period was 240 units (+10.3%), while the average growth over the last three periods is approximately 194 units. Given that historical growth streaks typically last 4-9 periods before a minor correction (as seen in P10 and P20), and we are currently on the third consecutive period of the current surge, I expect the upward momentum to continue. Applying the average recent growth of ~194-240 units to the P24 base suggests a forecast in the 2760-2800 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth acceleration confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P22-P24) with an average period-over-period growth of ~194 units (+8.9%), significantly exceeding the previous 1980-unit plateau.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term hyper-growth trajectory. Historically, the product has exhibited multi-period growth streaks followed by brief 1-2 period consolidations (e.g., Periods 10, 20-21). Following the correction at Period 21, demand has entered a new acceleration phase: P22 (2221), P23 (2326), P24 (2566), and P25 (2604). While the growth between the most recent two periods slowed from +10.3% (P23-P24) to +1.5% (P24-P25), the overall series suggests a continued upward momentum toward a higher plateau. The moving average of the last three periods is 2498, and the trend over the last four periods shows an average increase of ~127 units per period. I expect a modest increase in Period 26 as the growth rate likely stabilizes before a potential plateau, following the pattern seen in Periods 12-14.

Carry-over insight: Extended hyper-growth phase confirmed: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P22-P25), rising from 1983 to 2604, representing a 31% increase over the last five periods and establishing a new volume floor above 2500 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its long-term hyper-growth trajectory, recently entering a new volume regime above 2500 units. After a significant jump in Period 24 (+240 units), the last two periods (P25 and P26) have shown a clear deceleration in growth, with WoW increases of 38 and 41 units respectively (approx. +1.5%). This pattern of 'stair-step' growth followed by a brief consolidation phase is characteristic of the historical data (e.g., Periods 12-14). I expect the current consolidation to persist for at least one more period, maintaining the recent steady increment of approximately 40-45 units.

Carry-over insight: Growth deceleration phase confirmed at Period 26: After the breakout to 2500+ units, period-over-period growth slowed from ~10% (P24) to ~1.5% (P25-P26), indicating a temporary stabilization similar to the Period 12-14 plateau.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term hyper-growth trajectory with periodic plateaus followed by significant breakouts. Analyzing the recent trend: Period 24 (2566), Period 25 (2604), and Period 26 (2645) showed a stabilization near the 2600-unit level (average growth ~1.5%). However, Period 27 (2890) represents a sharp +9.3% breakout, similar to previous expansion phases (e.g., Period 15 and Period 22). Historically, these breakouts are followed by continued upward momentum or minor consolidation at the new high. Given the strength of the move in Period 27 and the consistent historical pattern of demand doubling roughly every 10-12 periods, I anticipate a follow-through toward the 3000-unit threshold. I will project a moderate increase, accounting for potential deceleration after the large Period 27 jump.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume breakout at Period 27: Demand exited the ~2600 unit plateau with a 9.3% increase to 2890, signaling the end of the P24-26 deceleration phase and the start of a new expansionary leg toward the 3000-unit level.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of chips(Regular) shows a consistent long-term hyper-growth trajectory punctuated by periodic corrections of 5-10% (e.g., Period 10, Period 20). Period 28 shows a correction of 8.5% (from 2890 to 2643), which aligns closely with these historical patterns. In previous instances, these dips were immediately followed by a recovery that either returned to the previous peak or established a new high. Demand in the expansionary phases typically grows between 5-10% WoW. Given the current drop-back to the Period 24-26 plateau (avg ~2600), a recovery is anticipated for Period 29. Applying a conservative growth factor to the current corrected base (2643 * ~1.08) suggests a return toward the 2850-2900 range, consistent with historical recovery velocities seen after Period 10 and Period 21.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) exhibits a clear long-term hyper-growth trend characterized by a pattern of 'step-ups' followed by brief corrections or plateaus. Most recently, demand peaked at 2890 (P27), underwent a characteristic correction to 2643 (P28), and has begun a recovery phase at 2814 (P29). Historically, as seen in the cycles at Period 11 and Period 22, the second period after a correction typically surpasses the previous peak. Given the recovery from P28 to P29 (+171 units), and the previous breakout magnitudes (P11 was +18% over the P9 peak, P22 was +7% over the P19 peak), I expect Period 30 to break the 2890 ceiling. A forecast in the 3000-3050 range aligns with the established growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated high-volume regime at Period 29: Following the Period 27 breakout and Period 28 correction, demand has stabilized in a new 2600-2900 range, with the 3-period average (2782) representing a 6.8% increase over the Period 24-26 plateau (2605).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained long-term hyper-growth trajectory with intermittent consolidation phases. Period 24-26 saw a plateau around the 2600 level, followed by a breakout in Period 27 (2890). After a minor correction in Period 28 (2643), the last two periods (2814 and 2873) indicate a return to growth and a new stabilization range between 2800 and 2900. Specifically, Period 30 saw a +2% increase over Period 29. Given the pattern of growth followed by short plateaus observed in Carry-over Insights for Periods 15, 20, and 26, the current phase (P29-P30) suggests a steady climb within this new high-volume regime. My forecast projects a continuation of this modest positive momentum.

Carry-over insight: New 2800-2900 volume floor established: Following the Period 28 correction, demand has stabilized above 2800 for two consecutive periods, marking a 7-8% increase over the previous Period 24-26 floor.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term hyper-growth trajectory. After establishing a volume floor in the 2800-2900 range (Periods 29-30), Period 31 saw a significant breakout to a new all-time high of 3046 (+6% WoW). Historically, following a breakout from a plateau (similar to Period 27 or Period 22), the product often sustains growth for at least two periods before experiencing a minor correction. Given the recent momentum of +173 units in the last period, I project a continued but slightly moderated increase for Period 32, targeting the low 3100s as the trend attempts to establish a new regime above the 3000-unit mark.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume breakout at Period 31: Demand exceeded the 3000-unit threshold for the first time, signaling a potential shift from the 2800-2900 plateau to a 3100+ regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a multi-phase hyper-growth trajectory, recently transitioning from a 2600-2800 unit plateau to a new floor above 3000 units. Since Period 29, demand has significantly strengthened, moving from 2814 to an average of 3025.5 over the last two periods (P31-P32). While Period 32 showed a minor 1.3% dip compared to the Period 31 peak (3005 vs 3046), this behavior mirrors previous consolidation patterns (like Periods 20-21 and 28) that preceded further expansion. Given the historical average weekly growth rate during expansionary phases and the stabilization above the 3000-unit mark, the forecast anticipates a return to growth or a high-level consolidation near the recent peak.

Carry-over insight: New 3000-unit volume floor confirmed: Demand has averaged 3025 over the last two periods, representing a 7% increase over the Period 28-30 average (2776).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term hyper-growth trend characterized by periodic breakouts followed by short stabilization phases. Period 33 showed a significant breakout of +12.8% (to 3391 units) from the previous 3000-unit plateau. Historically, such large surges are often followed by either a slight correction (e.g., Period 10, 20, 28) or a period of slower growth as the new volume is absorbed (e.g., Periods 12-14, 24-26). Given the strength of the recent breakout, I anticipate demand will consolidate near this new high, potentially continuing the upward trajectory but at a more moderate pace than the jump seen in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth breakout confirmed at Period 33: Demand increased 12.8% to 3391 units, establishing a new high-volume regime above the previous 3000-unit resistance level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, characterized by periods of rapid expansion followed by short stabilization plateaus. Recently, the demand broke above the 3000-unit mark at Period 31 and surged to a new high-volume regime around 3350-3400 units in Periods 33-34. Historically, when the product reaches a new peak, it tends to stabilize or slightly correct before the next leg up (similar to Periods 12-14, 24-26, and 29-30). Given that Period 33 (3391) and Period 34 (3368) show a minor 0.7% variance, the demand is currently in a stabilization phase. I expect the demand to remain within this 3350-3400 range for the immediate next period as the market absorbs the recent ~13% jump from the previous 3000-unit level.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated high-volume regime at Period 34: Following the breakout at Period 33, demand has stabilized in the 3350-3400 range, with the 2-period average (3380) being 11.7% higher than the Period 31-32 average (3025).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' is in a long-term hyper-growth phase characterized by distinct breakouts followed by brief stabilization periods. Historical data reveals a pattern of 2-3 periods of stabilization after a major spike before an eventual correction or new breakout. Most recently, demand spiked to 3391 (P33) and has since stabilized at 3368 (P34) and 3282 (P35), showing a slight 2.5% decrease in the last observed period. This mirroring of the Period 27-30 behavior (2890 followed by 2643, 2814, 2873) suggests we are currently in a high-volume consolidation phase. Given the most recent dip and the historical tendency for demand to move sideways for 3-4 periods after reaching a new level, a slight recovery or continued stabilization within the 3250-3350 range is expected. I am forecasting a marginal rebound toward the recent average of the current plateau.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, characterized by sharp breakouts followed by brief consolidations or minor corrections. Recently, demand established a floor above 3000 units (P31-P32) before breaking out to a new high-volume regime in Period 33 (3391). After a minor correction in Period 35 (3282), Period 36 recovered strongly to reach a new all-time high of 3448. This sequence follows the historical pattern of temporary dips preceding new peaks. Given the jump of ~166 units in the most recent period and the overall upward momentum, I forecast a continuation of this growth towards the next psychological threshold, while accounting for the volatile nature of these weekly jumps.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term hyper-growth trajectory. Recently, demand broke out of the 3300-3400 range identified in Period 35, reaching a new all-time high of 3748 in Period 37. This represents an 8.7% increase from Period 36 (3448) and a 14.2% increase over the Period 33-35 average (3347). Historically, when this product breaks into a new volume regime (e.g., the jumps at P15, P19, P22, P27, and P33), the initial surge is often followed by a secondary expansion or a slight stabilization at the new level. Given the 300-unit jump in the most recent period and the lack of immediate corrective signals, I anticipate continued upward momentum towards the 4000-unit threshold. Based on a projected growth rate of approximately 5-7% from the current high, the forecast is set at 3985.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume breakout confirmed at Period 37: Demand exceeded the 3700-unit mark for the first time, marking an 8.7% WoW increase and ending the Period 33-35 stabilization phase. The current 2-period average (3598) is 7.5% higher than the previous 3-period average (3347).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term hyper-growth trajectory. After a stabilization phase between Periods 33-36 (averaging ~3370 units), demand has aggressively broken out to the upside in the last two periods (Period 37: 3748; Period 38: 3929). This represents a 4.8% WoW increase in the most recent period and an 8.7% jump when the breakout began. Historically, these breakouts tend to sustain for 2-4 periods before hitting a new plateau. The average growth over the last two periods is ~180 units per period. Following this momentum, a forecast near 4100 units is appropriate, reflecting continued expansion within the current high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-velocity breakout confirmed at Period 38: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P36-P38), rising from 3448 to 3929 (+14%), confirming the end of the P33-35 plateau and establishing a new growth leg toward the 4000-unit threshold.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained long-term hyper-growth trajectory, recently accelerating through another breakout phase. Historical patterns show that demand frequently enters a multi-period growth streak (e.g., Periods 15-19, 22-25, 36-39) before a temporary stabilization or correction. Currently, demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P36-P39), rising from 3448 to 4212. The most recent period-over-period growth was ~7.2% (283 units). Given that previous growth phases often peak at 4-5 periods of consistent increases followed by a minor correction (as seen in Period 10, Period 20, and Period 28), and that demand has just crossed the significant 4000-unit psychological threshold, I anticipate a modest continued increase as the momentum persists, projected at a slightly decelerated rate of ~4-5% compared to the previous jump.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth trajectory sustained through Period 39: Demand has crossed the 4000-unit threshold for the first time, marking a 22% increase over the Period 33-35 average (3347). This confirms a new expansionary leg following the stabilization observed in early Period 30s.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained hyper-growth trajectory. Historical data shows that since Period 36, demand has increased for five consecutive periods (3448, 3748, 3929, 4212, 4461). The last three periods (P38-P40) show an average WoW growth rate of approximately 6.5% (approx +250 units per period). Specifically, the jump from Period 39 to 40 was 249 units (+5.9%). Given that the product is entering a high-velocity phase (crossing the 4000-unit threshold in Period 39 and accelerating in Period 40), I expect the upward trend to persist. Applying the recent absolute growth trend (~250 units) to the Period 40 base of 4461 suggests a forecast in the 4700 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-velocity growth through Period 40: Demand has increased for five consecutive periods, rising from 3448 to 4461 (+29%). The 3-period average (4200) is 15.1% higher than the preceding 3-period average (3649), confirming the hyper-growth regime is continuing to scale beyond the 4000-unit mark.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a persistent hyper-growth trajectory that has recently crossed the 4000-unit threshold. From Period 36 to Period 40, demand increased consecutively for five periods, rising from 3448 to 4461. Period 41 saw a decrease to 4166 (-6.6%). This pattern of a minor correction (5-10% drop) following a multi-period growth streak has been observed twice before: at Period 10 (-10.3%) and Period 20 (-4.9%). Historically, these corrections have been followed by immediate rebounds or stabilization before a new growth leg. Specifically, after the Period 10 dip, demand grew 31% in the next period; after the Period 20 dip, demand stabilized (+0.5% in P21) then grew 12% in P22. Given the strong momentum of the current regime (the Period 39-41 average of 4279 is 17% higher than the Period 36-38 average), the Period 41 dip is interpreted as a temporary consolidation. I expect demand to rebound toward the previous high-water mark of ~4400-4500 units.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation phase at Period 41: Following a 5-period growth streak to 4461, demand corrected to 4166 (-6.6%), mirroring previous corrections at Period 10 and Period 20. The current 3-period average remains at 4279 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for chips(Regular) shows a long-term hyper-growth trend punctuated by periodic corrections (e.g., Period 10, Period 20, Period 28). Currently, demand is in a correction phase following the Period 40 peak of 4461. Demand dropped to 4166 (Period 41) and 4040 (Period 42). Historically, these corrections last 1-2 periods before stabilizing or rebounding. The decline rate decreased from -6.6% (P40 to P41) to -3.0% (P41 to P42), suggesting the floor is near. Based on previous recovery patterns, I expect demand to stabilize and potentially start a modest recovery towards the 4200 level.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significant corrective phase following the peak of 4461 in Period 40. Demand has decreased for three consecutive periods: Period 41 (4166), Period 42 (4040), and Period 43 (3950). This behavior mirrors previous cyclical corrections (e.g., Periods 10, 20, and 28) where rapid hyper-growth is followed by a period of stabilization or mild decline. The current average of the last three periods (4052) is down from the peak but remains within a high-volume regime. Given that the decline from P42 to P43 (-90 units) was less than the decline from P40 to P41 (-295 units), there is evidence that the downward momentum is beginning to decelerate as demand approaches the previous 3900-4000 support level established in Period 38/39. I forecast a slight further softening as demand stabilizes around the 3900 mark.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak correction confirmed at Period 43: Demand has decreased for three consecutive periods since Period 40, falling from 4461 to 3950 (-11.5%). This confirms a shift from hyper-growth to a consolidation/correction phase similar to Period 28-30.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been in a long-term hyper-growth phase, with periodic corrections and consolidations. Following the peak at Period 40 (4461 units), the product underwent a 3-period correction (P41-P43), dropping to 3950 units. However, Period 44 saw a sharp rebound to 4444 units (+12.5% WoW), nearly returning to the all-time high. This suggests the correction phase is over and the upward trajectory has resumed. Historically, after similar corrections at P10, P20, and P28, demand typically stabilized or hit new highs within 2-3 periods. Given the strong momentum in Period 44 and the pattern of growth resuming after a dip, I expect demand to follow this trend and approach or slightly exceed the recent high.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth recovery at Period 44: After a 3-period correction from 4461 to 3950 (-11.5%), demand surged back to 4444 (+12.5%), signaling the end of the consolidation phase and the resumption of the long-term upward trend.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recovery from a three-period correction (P41-P43) where demand fell from 4461 to 3950. Period 44 saw a sharp rebound to 4444, followed by a slight consolidation in Period 45 at 4364 (-1.8%). Historically, this pattern fits a 'stair-step' growth model seen at Periods 10, 20, and 28, where a peak is followed by a brief correction and then a stabilization or new breakout. The average demand of the last two periods (4404) is significantly higher than the correction floor (3950) and aligns with the previous all-time high of 4461. Given the slight dip in Period 45 after the Period 44 surge, a stabilization or minor growth towards the 4400-4500 range is expected as the product establishes a new volume floor. Forecast is set near the recent two-period average.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new expansionary leg following the Period 41-43 correction (which saw demand drop from 4461 to 3950). In Period 46, demand reached a new all-time high of 4530, surpassing the previous Period 40 peak. Over the last three periods (P44-P46), the average demand has settled at 4446 units, representing a 12.5% recovery from the recent trough. Historically, breakouts into new territory for this SKU involve initial volatility followed by sustained upward momentum. Given the recent +3.8% increase from P45 to P46 and the recurring historical pattern of growth streaks lasting 3-5 periods post-correction, a continued moderate increase is expected as the demand establishes a new floor above 4500.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak established at Period 46: Demand reached an all-time high of 4530, confirming the end of the Period 41-43 correction and signaling a shift into a 4500+ volume regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17075.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, characterized by periods of rapid expansion followed by brief stabilization or minor corrections. Recently, demand has shifted into a new 4500+ volume regime. After recovering from a correction phase (Periods 41-43), demand set a new peak at Period 46 (4530) and followed through with another increase at Period 47 (4595). The last three periods (P45-P47) show a consistent upward trend with an average of 4496 units. Comparing Period 46 and 47, there is a WoW growth of 1.4%. Given this momentum and the historical pattern of sustained growth legs following breakouts, I expect demand to continue its ascent towards the 4700-4800 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-correction growth phase: Following the recovery at Period 45, demand has achieved two consecutive all-time highs (P46-P47), confirming a new volume floor above 4500 units and the resumption of the primary upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17932.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained hyper-growth phase. Since the recovery at Period 44 (4444 units), demand has set three consecutive higher prints, culminating in a new all-time high of 4776 in Period 48 (+3.9% WoW). Over the last three periods (P46-P48), the average growth rate has been approximately 2.7% per period. Given the momentum observed in the most recent period (+181 units) and the historical pattern of 3-5 period growth bursts before correction (as seen in P36-40), I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory toward the 5000-unit threshold. I am forecasting a growth of approximately 3% over the Period 48 value.

Carry-over insight: New expansionary leg confirmed starting Period 46: Demand has achieved three consecutive gains, rising from 4364 to 4776 (+9.4%), confirming the 4500-unit level as the new volume floor and indicating momentum toward the 5000-unit mark.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, characterized by periods of rapid expansion followed by short consolidation phases. Recently, demand has achieved a new milestone by breaking the 5000-unit threshold in Period 49 (5087 units). This follows four consecutive periods of growth from Period 45 (4364 units), representing a 16.6% increase in just four weeks. The moving average of the last three periods (Period 47-49) is 4819 units, which is 9.5% higher than the preceding three-period average (Period 44-46) of 4446 units. Historically, similar breakouts (e.g., Period 19, Period 33, Period 40) often lead to a short-term continuation of momentum or a subtle deceleration. Given the current velocity of the 500-unit jump over the last three weeks, a forecast of 5250 accounts for continued upward momentum while anticipating a potential slight moderation in the rate of growth as the product settles into the 5000+ volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth breakout at Period 49: Demand exceeded the 5000-unit threshold for the first time, marking a 14% increase over the Period 44-46 average (4446). This confirms the 4500-4700 range as the previous floor and establishes a new expansionary leg.
