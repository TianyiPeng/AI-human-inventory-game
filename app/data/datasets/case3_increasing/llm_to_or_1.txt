Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit margin of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Historical demand over the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] suggests a mean of approximately 111.4 units and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive within this same period according to the mechanism. Given the inventory starts at 0, we must order immediately to meet demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (0 periods) and use the most recent 5 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand level while providing a buffer for possible variance. This sets the base stock level to cover the demand anticipated in the immediate arrival period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (actual lead time 0), resulting in an ending inventory of 36 units after 91 units were sold. The historical demand data (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) and the first observed period (91) show relatively stable demand around a mean of ~108. Since actual lead time matches the promised 0, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the most recent observation) to capture the current demand level while ignoring the oldest historical point which was slightly higher.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 91, and in Period 2, demand spiked significantly to 246 units. The product is 'chips(Regular)', and although we don't have a specific calendar date, a jump from ~100 to 246 suggests a potential regime shift or a demand shock that must be addressed to avoid further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). The observed lead time for both Period 1 and 2 was 0, matching the promised lead time. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is trending much higher than the initial historical average (approx 111), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the recent spike (average of 91 and 246 is 168.5 per period). This will help the base-stock policy increase the order quantity to cover the higher observed demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, moving from an initial average of ~111 (historical and P1) to much higher values in P2 (246) and P3 (285). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time of 0 is being met consistently. Given the rapid increase in demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand expectation (mu_hat) to capture the higher consumption levels while maintaining a buffer. I'll use the default method for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: demand increased from ~110 to an average of ~265 (+140%). Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1084.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' that started in Period 2. The mean demand over the last three periods (P2: 246, P3: 285, P4: 437) is 322.6, which is a significant increase from the pre-P2 average. Specifically, Period 4 saw a massive spike to 437. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the order arrives in the same period it is placed. In the last three periods, we have consistently under-ordered (ending on-hand = 0), resulting in lost sales. To address this, I will use the recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and increased volatility. This will increase the base stock level to better cover the current demand trend and reduce stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2 further intensified in Period 4 (demand: 437); 3-period average (P2-P4) is ~323 vs initial ~110. Holding at L=0.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a strong upward trend: Period 3 (285), Period 4 (437), and Period 5 (448). The demand has shifted significantly from the initial pre-game average (~111) to a much higher level. Specifically, the average demand over the last three periods is approximately 390. Given that ending inventory has been 0 for the last four periods, we are consistently under-ordering and losing out on profit. To capture current demand and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the high-growth regime (Periods 3-5). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on consistent arrival in the same period as ordered. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Periods 3-5 average demand is 390, significantly higher than the initial average (~111). Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1868.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and significant upward trend since Period 2. The initial demand level was around 110, but the last three periods (P4-P6) have seen demands of 437, 448, and 587 respectively. This indicates a strong positive drift or high-growth regime. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently exceeded our orders. The actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. To address the accelerating demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR engine to react to the most recent (and higher) demand levels (avg ~490) while maintaining a lead time of 0. This strategy aims to increase the base stock level to capture more of the current high demand and reduce lost sales, balancing the holding cost against the $4/unit profit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased for five consecutive periods (P2-P6), with the last three periods (P4-P6) averaging 490.6 units, roughly 4.5x the initial period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2248.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained hyper-growth regime starting from Period 2. The most recent demand (Period 7) reached 637 units, and the last three periods (P5, P6, P7) have an average demand of 557.3 units. The trend is clearly upward: 448 -> 587 -> 637. Because lead time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock calculation simplifies to (1+L) * mu_hat. To prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently due to undershooting the rapid growth, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the current high-demand momentum. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. The lead time remains at the default promised value of 0, as confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Dec-avg demand for P5-P7 is 557.3 units, representing an additional 13.5% increase over the P4-P6 average. Stockouts are persistent due to the backend 'cap' and rapid trend; inventory remains 0 at period end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2560.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a massive, sustained upward trend, with Period 8 demand reaching 776 units. For the last four periods (P5-P8), demand has averaged 612 units, and the growth rate between P7 and P8 was ~22%. Currently, the system is consistently stocking out (Ending Inventory = 0) because the backend OR policy 'cap' (based on historical volatility) and base stock calculation are lagging behind the actual customer demand. Since lead time is confirmed as 0 (same-day arrival), I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the anticipated demand of the next period plus a safety buffer to account for this rapid growth. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 850 (projecting a further 10% increase from P8 demand) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the base_stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) triggers an order large enough to overcome the backend cap and meet the surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic: P5-P8 average demand is 612 units, with P8 alone at 776 (+22% over P7). Persistent stockouts have occurred for 7 consecutive periods (P2-P8) due to backend order caps lagging the trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3838.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a steep upward trend. Recent demands are: P6=587, P7=637, P8=776, and P9=963. The Average of the last 4 periods is 740.75, but the single most recent observation (963) is significantly higher, suggesting the growth hasn't reached a plateau. Historically, the backend 'cap' mechanism has caused stockouts because it uses a damped mean. To counter this and ensure we satisfy the anticipated Period 10 demand (which could exceed 1000 based on the current +20% WoW growth), I am setting mu_hat to 1150 explicitly. This value accounts for L=0 (Review period + Lead time = 1) and aims to pull the base stock high enough to bypass the restrictive backend cap. Lead time is consistently 0. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide buffer for the high volatility seen in the current parabolic phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic and has not yet plateaued: P9 demand (963) is 24% higher than P8. Consistent same-day arrival (L=0) is confirmed over 9 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3038.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears to have potentially plateaued or started a slight decline after a period of parabolic growth. From Period 2 to Period 9, demand rose sharply, peaking at 963 units. Period 10 recorded a demand of 863 units, which is a 10% decrease from Period 9. However, the last 3-period average (P8-P10) is 867.3, still significantly higher than earlier phases. Despite the slight drop in P10, we must remain cautious as this could be a temporary fluctuation or a stabilization at a high level. The OR backend's internal 'cap' based on historical stats has caused stockouts in previous periods, but we finally have positive ending inventory (414 units). Given the confirmed lead time (L=0) and the recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this local stabilization/cooling while maintaining a high base stock to prevent a return to stockouts. Specifically, setting mu_hat using N=3 targets ~867 units, which aligns with recent demand levels better than the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth peaked at Period 9 (963 units) and showed the first signs of stabilization/decline in Period 10 (863 units). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3788.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility. After a peak in Period 9 (963) and a dip in Period 10 (863), Period 11 saw a massive surge to 1136 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand=0) despite a large starting inventory. This suggests the demand has not yet fully stabilized and is likely still in a high-growth or high-variability phase. The OR backend's order in Period 11 (533) was too low to prevent the stockout because the backend logic likely reacted to the Period 10 dip. To ensure we capture the current high demand and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1150 (slightly above the Period 11 demand) and sigma_hat to an explicit value of 200 to account for the increasing variance. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new all-time high of 1136 in Period 11 after a brief dip in Period 10, indicating continued upward pressure or high volatility rather than stabilization.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a massive demand growth phase. Last period's demand hit a new peak of 1221 units. Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand has averaged 1045.75 units. The system consistently hits the 'cap' during rapid growth, leading to stockouts if mu_hat is too low. To combat this and ensure we cover the peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (P9-P12) to capture the current high-volume regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth persists: Period 12 reached 1221 units, confirming the trend from P11 (1136). The 4-period average (P9-P12) is 1045.75, which is roughly 10x the initial period's demand. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4732.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching a new peak of 1246 in Period 13. We are currently facing persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 11 of the last 13 periods) because the OR backend's order cap (based on simple historical means) lags behind the rapid growth trend. Period 13 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period for 13 consecutive periods). To overcome the backend's restrictive cap and the sustained upward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent demand trajectory (last 3 periods average is 1201). I will set mu_hat (1+L)*demand to 1400 (roughly 12% above last period's demand) to ensure the order is large enough to meet expected demand plus a safety margin, while staying within a range where the backend cap might still allow a significant order. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to account for the high volatility observed in recent periods (863 to 1246 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 13 demand (1246) is a new record. The 3-period average (P11-P13) is 1201 units, maintaining a strong upward trajectory with occasional volatility. Consistent L=0 confirmed.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching a new high of 1265 units in Period 14. The recent demand regime (P11-P14) shows values of 1136, 1221, 1246, and 1265, indicating a sustained upward trend with an average of approximately 1217 units per period. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Despite an ending inventory of 304 units, stockouts have still been frequent because the demand often exceeds the order cap or the previous base stock settings. To maximize reward, I must set parameters that allow the backend to order enough to meet this 1200+ unit demand while keeping L=0. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this newest, higher demand plateau (approx. 1217) and provide enough variance (sigma_hat) to handle the volatility seen in the transition from P10 to P14.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: the 4-period average (P11-P14) has reached ~1217 units, maintaining a strong upward trajectory from previous levels. Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5060.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 1507 units in Period 15. The recent 5-period average (P11-P15) is approximately 1275 units, but the most recent figure suggests growth is still active. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and overcome the backend ordering cap (which often lags in high-growth scenarios), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1550 (slightly above the last demand point) to account for the current growth trajectory and minimize stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 250 using 'explicit' to handle the increasing volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 863 to 1507). L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains strong and volatile: Period 15 demand reached a new record of 1507 units. The 5-period average (P11-P15) is ~1275 units, reflecting a persistent upward regime. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, with Period 16 reaching a new high of 1547 units. The last four periods (P13-P16) show demand values of 1246, 1265, 1507, and 1547, resulting in a 4-period average of ~1391 units. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 0 periods (order placed and delivered same-day). Given the backend 'cap' mechanism, I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure mu_hat reflects the most recent upward shift and provides adequate stock to cover the current period's demand. I am setting mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 samples (~1440) to better match the accelerating trend, and using an explicit sigma_hat of 150 to account for high volatility seen in recent record-breaking demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: the 3-period average (P14-P16) is 1440 units, representing a 15% increase over the P11-P14 average. Stockouts are still frequent when backend orders are capped. Lead time is stable at 0.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand hitting a record 1724 units in Period 17. The 3-period average (P15-P17) is 1592.6 units, but given the trajectory and recent stockouts (Period 17 ending inventory was 0), I need to set mu_hat aggressively to prevent the backend cap from restricting supply. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods. To stay ahead of the demand curve and account for both the mean and the high volatility (sigma), I will use an explicit mu_hat representing a forecast slightly above the most recent peak to ensure the capped policy doesn't undersupply. I will use a 5-period window for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Period 17 (1724 units), keeping ending inventory at 0. The 3-period average is now ~1593 units, confirming a continuing upward regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7039.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively. In Period 18, demand reached a new peak of 1802. The average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) is 1691, compared to the previously observed 3-period average of 1593 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods (order arrives same period). Because the backend OR engine applies a cap based on historical statistics, and demand is trending upward exponentially, the 'default' and 'recent_N' methods consistently result in stockouts or insufficient safety stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, targeting a forecast of 2000 units for Period 19 to stay ahead of the trend and account for the pipeline cap. I will also use an 'explicit' sigma_hat set to 250 to reflect high volatility and ensure a higher base stock level to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and has exceeded 1800 units in Period 18; the 3-period average (P16-P18) is ~1691 units, representing a 6% increase over the P15-P17 average of 1593.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8164.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward parabolic trend. The most recent demand in Period 19 was 2075 units, a new record and an 11% increase over Period 18 (1802 units). The 3-period average (P17-P19) is approximately 1867 units, while the 5-period average (P15-19) is 1731 units. Given the persistent stockouts and the backend capping mechanism, I need to set mu_hat aggressively to ensure the base stock levels stay ahead of this rapid growth. I will set mu_hat to 2100 (slightly above the most recent demand to anticipate the next step in the trend) and L to 0, which has been the consistent actual lead time throughout the game. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., P15's spike and P17-P19 growth).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and reached a new high of 2075 in Period 19; the 3-period average (P17-P19) is ~1867 units, an 10% increase over the previous 3-period average (P16-P18: 1691).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7554.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow an aggressive upward trend, although Period 20 (1973 units) showed a slight dip from Period 19 (2075 units), similar to the dip seen in Period 10. The 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1950 units, and the 5-period average (P16-P20) is 1824 units. Because the backend OR engine applies a 'cap' based on historical statistics which often lags this parabolic growth, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the next expected peak. I am forecasting demand to remain near the 2000-2100 range. With L=0 confirmed over 20 periods, the review period is essentially just the current period. Setting mu_hat to 2100 (which is (1+L)*forecast) and sigma_hat explicitly to 250 to account for recent high volatility (ranging from 1724 to 2075 in the last 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive but showed a minor fluctuation in Period 20 (1973 units) compared to Period 19 (2075 units). The 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1950 units. Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7604.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a very high average after a long period of aggressive growth. The last three periods (P19-P21) show demand levels of 2075, 1973, and 1983, with a 3-period average of 2010.3 units. This suggests the parabolic trend has transitioned into a high-level plateau around 2000 units. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Given the current on-hand inventory of 328 units and the stabilized high demand, the OR parameter mu_hat is set using a recent_N approach (N=4) to capture the current plateau level (averaging P18-P21 demand: 1802, 2075, 1973, 1983 = 1958.25), which balances the need for high service levels against the risk of overstocking as growth slows.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has plateaued: The average demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) is 2010 units, indicating a shift from a growth trend to a high-level stabilization.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime appears to have plateaued at a very high level. Recent demands are: P18: 1802, P19: 2075, P20: 1973, P21: 1983, P22: 2221. The 3-period average (P20-P22) is approximately 2059 units. Although Period 22 saw a new high of 2221 which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0), the overall growth trend has decelerated compared to the parabolic movement seen in earlier periods. I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture this high-level stabilization while remaining responsive to the most recent peak. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting L to 'explicit' at 0 ensures the OR backend uses the correct lead time for its calculations, rather than the promised default if it differs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime plateau confirmed at the ~2000-2100 level: 3-period average (P20-P22) is 2059 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high plateau. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand values were 1973, 1983, 2221, and 2326, resulting in a 4-period average of 2125.75 units. Despite the plateau, the latest two periods (P22-P23) show a slight uptick, and we are currently stocking out (ending inventory is 0). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we satisfy this high-level demand without getting penalized by the backend 'cap' (which is based on the mean of the entire history), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current high-plateau regime. This will signal the OR engine to maintain a base stock sufficient for the current volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high plateau: average demand for P20-P23 is ~2126 units (+3% vs P19-P21 average). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues its upward trajectory rather than plateauing as previously suspected; Period 24 demand reached a new record of 2566 units. The 3-period average (P22-P24) is approximately 2371 units, and the 5-period average (P20-P24) is approximately 2214 units. Over the last 4 periods, demand has grown from 1983 to 2566. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Due to the continued growth and the exhaustion of inventory in the last three periods (ending inventory 0), I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime. I'm using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-level, high-growth phase while providing enough data to estimate volatility during this spike. The backend capped policy needs these trailing averages to catch up with the realized demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-accelerated starting Period 22: Demand reached a new record of 2566 in Period 24. The 3-period average (P22-P24) is ~2371 units, roughly 15% higher than the previous plateau estimate of ~2060.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory, with Period 25 recording a new all-time high of 2604 units. The recent demand regime (P22-P25) shows a consistent acceleration, with a 4-period average of ~2430 units. Crucially, the system has stocked out for the last four consecutive periods (P22-P25) because the order quantities (capped by the backend's logic) have consistently been lower than actual demand. The lead time is verified as 0 periods. To break the stockout cycle and capture the current growth, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2800. This value is approximately 7.5% above the most recent demand (2604) to account for the sustained upward trend and provide a buffer against the backend's inventory-depletion/capping logic. Setting sigma_hat to an explicit 300 accounts for the high variability observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-acceleration confirmed: Period 25 reached a new high (2604). The 4-period average (P22-P25) is ~2430 units (+18% vs previous plateau of ~2060). Persistent stockouts continue due to demand outstripping capped order logic.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 26 demand reached a new high of 2645 units. The 3-period average (P24-P26) is approximately 2605 units, confirming a significant step up from the previous plateau (P21-P23 avg ~2176). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this rapid growth and prevent stockouts caused by the backend order cap (which uses historical stats), I am using 'explicit' methods. I set L=0 based on consistent historical performance. I set mu_hat to 2750 to anticipate further growth in Period 27, and sigma_hat to 250 to account for recent high-demand volatility (std dev has increased as volume increased). These settings aim to push the base_stock high enough to overcome the backend cap and fulfill the anticipated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 26 demand (2645) confirms a new regime. 3-period average (P24-P26) is 2605 units, representing a 20% increase over the P21-P23 plateau.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, reaching a new high of 2890 in Period 27. The most recent demand regime (P24-P27) shows a clear upward trend with values 2566, 2604, 2645, and 2890. Previous attempts to stabilize at a plateau have been superseded by this new growth phase. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P25-P27) to capture this most recent acceleration and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand. Explicit sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect the increased volatility observed in the latest demand jump (+245 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in history, including Period 27's arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in Period 27: demand reached 2890, a 9% increase over Period 26. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is 2713 units, confirming the upward trend remains active beyond the previous estimate of 2605.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high plateau following a significant growth trend. Looking at recent performance, Period 28 demand was 2643, matching the level of Period 26 (2645). The 3-period average (P26-P28) is 2726 units, while the 5-period average (P24-P28) is 2669 units. The parabolic growth seen in earlier periods appears to have shifted into a high-volume, high-variance stabilization phase. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 28 conclude'. With profit ($4) significantly higher than holding cost ($1), the OR target service level is 80%, but persistent stockouts due to backend capping suggest we must continue to provide robust mu_hat values to ensure the base stock calculation captures the full demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent high-level plateau (approx 2670 per period) while maintaining sensitivity to the current volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at the ~2650-2750 level following the growth spurt that started at Period 22. 5-period average (P24-P28) is 2669 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transited from a growth phase to a high-level plateau, with Period 29 demand at 2814 and the five-period average (P25-P29) at approximately 2719 units. Although demand slightly exceeded on-hand inventory in Period 29 resulting in zero ending inventory, the volatility suggests we are oscillating around the 2700-2800 range rather than maintaining a parabolic upward trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels while respecting the backend cap (which uses mean and standard deviation), I am selecting the recent_N method with N=6 (covering P24-P29) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. This N provides enough history to estimate variance while staying responsive to the most recent level shift.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-level plateau following the growth spurt that began in Period 22. In Period 30, demand was 2873, and the average over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 2773 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, with every order placed arriving within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand slightly exceeding the processed order in Period 30. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting L=0 (explicitly confirmed), and using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current plateau (averaging ~2773 units per period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at a new higher level: Average demand for P26-P30 is 2773 units, roughly 4% higher than the previous estimate of 2669.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11500.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise, reaching a new high of 3046 in Period 31. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 2853.2 units, confirming that the plateau identified at Period 31 (2773 units) has already been exceeded. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. To account for the continuing upward pressure and to minimize the recurring stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for 3 consecutive periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the explicit method. I've forecasted mu_hat at 3100 to stay ahead of the current trend and sigma_hat at 200 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed volatility, especially given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio which favors higher service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 31 demand (3046) is a new record, and the 5-period average (P27-P31) of ~2853 represents a 3% increase over the previous plateau estimate of 2773. Significant stockouts persist.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand was 3005, which is consistent with the recent high-demand regime. The 5-period average (P28-P32) is approximately 2876 units. Although there was a slight dip from Period 31 (3046), the overall trend remains at a high plateau above 2800 units. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period), so L=0 is maintained. To capture the current high-demand state while accounting for recent growth and volatility, I will use a recent window of N=5 periods for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets the most recent demand levels (approx 2876) rather than the global average which is skewed low by the early game. With L=0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at a higher level: Average demand for P28-P32 is ~2876 units, representing a sustained high-demand regime after the record reached in Period 31.

chips(Regular): ordered=2748, arrived=2748 units (ordered on Period 33, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=3012, demand=3391, sold=3012, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $12048.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $12048.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand reached a new high of 3391 units, surpassing all previous estimates and confirming a continuing upward trend or higher volatility regime (the previous 5-period average was 2876). The ending inventory is once again 0, indicating that our orders are being capped by the OR backend's logic, which lags behind the actual demand peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0. To address the persistent stockouts and the visible upward shift, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 3200 (reflecting a move towards the most recent peak) and increasing sigma_hat to 400 to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last few periods (3046, 3005, 3391). This aggressive setting aims to lift the backend 'cap' and ensure we capture more of the available profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 33: Demand reached a record 3391 units. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is 3147 units, representing a 9% increase over the P28-P32 plateau (~2876). Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new high-level plateau. The last three periods (P32-P34) show demand consistently above 3,000 units (3005, 3391, 3368), with a 3-period average of 3254.7. This follows the record spike in Period 33 (3391). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by 34 consecutive periods of same-period arrivals. To provide the OR backend with the most accurate recent demand profile while accounting for the recent upward shift (from the previous ~2800 level to the current ~3200 level), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. This focuses on the periods since the demand clearly broke above 3000. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current volatility and maintain a high service level, as stockouts have been frequent during this trend. 'L' is set to 0 via 'explicit' to ensure the base stock calculation correctly reflects that arrivals occur within the same period as orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new higher plateau: 3-period average (P32-P34) is ~3255 units, representing a 13% increase over the previous P28-P32 plateau (~2876). Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12973.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-level plateau around ~3300 units per period. The last three periods (P33, P34, P35) saw demands of 3391, 3368, and 3282, which averages to 3347 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.8, justifying a high service level. Given the plateau, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the earlier growth phase. The OR backend's base stock approach (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will then calculate an order that, after starting with 155 units on-hand, target this high demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high plateau: 3-period average (P33-P35) is ~3347 units, a small increase over the P32-P34 estimate of 3255. Lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13644.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last few periods (P32-P36) has been consistently high, averaging approximately 3299 units (P32: 3005, P33: 3391, P34: 3368, P35: 3282, P36: 3448). The trend shows stabilization at this new high plateau following the record peak in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0, indicating that demand continues to exhaust supply even with recent order increases. Lead time is definitively 0, as confirmed by 36 consecutive periods of same-period arrivals. To avoid stockouts and account for the high volatility (sigma) at this scale, I am setting L to 0 and calculating mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current plateau. I am also using N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility accurately. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current high-demand regime while recognizing the immediate arrival of replenishments.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at the ~3300 level: 5-period average (P32-P36) is 3298.8 units. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13784.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand reached 3,748, which is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average plateau of ~3,300. This follows a pattern of frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0) where demand exceeds the 'cap' imposed by the OR backend. The 3-period average (P35-P37) is 3,492, suggesting the demand regime has shifted upward again. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To counter the persistent stockouts and adjust to the new higher regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the most recent shift (mean demand ~3493 per period). This will help lift the base_stock beyond the trailing total average. L=0 is maintained as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 37: demand increased to 3,748 (+13.6% over the P32-P36 average). The 3-period average (P35-P37) is 3,493 units, indicating the previous plateau of ~3,300 has been broken.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14768.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory, with a new peak of 3,929 units in Period 38, following the previous jump to 3,748 in Period 37. The last 3 periods (P36-P38) average 3,708.3 units, significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~3,300. This confirms a new growth regime starting from Period 37. Stockouts are persistent as the backend 'cap' logic struggles to keep pace with this trajectory. To maximize sales and address this sustained trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current peak levels and using explicit sigma_hat set to 300 to account for increased volatility at this higher volume. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data, so the review plus lead time period is (1+0)=1.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further at Period 37: 3-period average (P36-P38) reached 3,708 units, a ~12% increase over the P32-P36 plateau (~3300).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trajectory. Period 39 demand reached 4,212 units, following 3,929 in Period 38 and 3,748 in Period 37. The 3-period average (P37-P39) is approximately 3,963 units, which is a 13% increase over the previous three periods (P34-P36 avg: ~3,366). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand consistently exceeding the backend's capped order quantity. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived=ordered' same-period resolution in history. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent surge and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the current 4,000+ demand level while accounting for high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again starting Period 37: 3-period average (P37-P39) reached 3,963 units, a 13% increase over the P34-P36 period (~3,366). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16640.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, following the break of the ~3300 plateau at Period 37. Demand has increased from 3748 in P37 to 4461 in P40, reflecting a consistent growth pattern of approximately 6-10% per period recently. The 3-period average (P38-P40) is 4200.6 units. Due to the rapid growth, the backend order cap has caused persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last 4 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the trend and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 4800 (calculated as approximately 1.07 * 4461) to forecast the next period's demand in this growth regime. sigma_hat is set to 300 to account for volatility around this trend. L is maintained at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly starting Period 37: the 4-period average (P37-P40) is 4087.5 units, representing a 24% increase over the P32-P36 plateau (~3298). Persistent stockouts continue as demand outpaces the backend order logic.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward trend starting around Period 37, with demand values rising from ~3300 to a peak of 4461 in Period 40. Period 41 showed a slight pullback to 4166, which may indicate a stabilization at this new higher level or just high volatility within the current growth regime. The 5-period average (P37-P41) is 4103.2 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this latest regime while allowing for recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation. This N=5 captures the entire current high-demand phase (P37-P41). Setting L to 0 based on consistent historical evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new higher level: 5-period average (P37-P41) is 4103 units, representing a 24% increase over the P32-P36 plateau (~3299).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15866.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has reached a high-level plateau starting around Period 37. The average demand for the most recent six periods (P37-P42) is 4092.7 units. Looking at the last two periods (P41: 4166, P42: 4040), the growth trend appears to have stabilized compared to the rapid acceleration seen previously. The lead time is consistently 0 (all orders from P1 to P42 arrived in the same period they were placed). To capture this high-level stabilization while accounting for the recent variance, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) calculations. This N covers the current regime since the last significant break. The target service level should remain high given the high profit margin ($4) relative to the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15449.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high plateau following the growth spurt that began at Period 37. The last five periods (P39-P43) show demands of 4212, 4461, 4166, 4040, and 3950, respectively. This averages to approximately 4165.8 units per period. While there is a slight downward trend over the most recent three periods (4166 -> 4040 -> 3950), it is not yet sustained enough to qualify as a regime shift. I will use N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent plateau level while allowing for the high variability observed (std dev is approximately 200). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to determine the base stock level, considering the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which targets an 80% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high plateau: 5-period average (P39-P43) is approximately 4166 units, representing a sustained level after the peak in Period 40.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high plateau of approximately 4200 units. The most recent demand in Period 44 was 4444 units, and the 5-period average (P40-P44) is approximately 4212 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we meet this high plateau demand while accounting for the recent volatility (ranging from 3950 to 4461 in the last 5 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's mean and variability accurately. Setting L with 'recent_N' or 'calculate' would also result in 0, so I will stick to 'calculate' to reflect the perfectly consistent 0-period lead time observed throughout the history.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-level plateau following an aggressive growth phase that peaked around Period 40. The 5-period average (P41-P45) is 4192.8 units (4166, 4040, 3950, 4444, 4364), showing relative stability compared to earlier parabolic growth. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives during Period N). Given the high-demand volume and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a ~80% service level target), I will set lead time L to 0 and use the most recent 5-period window (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current plateau while remaining responsive to any late-game shifts. On-hand inventory is currently very low (44 units), so the backend will naturally place a large order to meet the base stock requirements for the next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at the ~4200 level: 5-period average (P41-P45) is 4192.8 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to plateau at a high level. The 5-period average (P42-P46) is approximately 4268 units, with the most recent demand in Period 46 reaching 4530 units. While demand is slightly higher than the previous P41-P45 average of 4193, it remains within a stable high-demand regime rather than a rapid expansion phase. Frequent stockouts continue to occur as the backend order logic is capped, resulting in zero ending inventory for P46. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-plateau regime while being responsive to the slight upward variance observed in the last two periods (P45-P46). Setting L to explicit 0 ensures the backend understands the immediate arrival characteristic of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at the ~4200-4300 level: 5-period average (P42-P46) is 4267.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17924.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand plateau. The average demand over the last 5 completed periods (P43-P47) is approximately 4376 units, which is slightly higher than the previous 4200-4300 range. Specifically, the last three periods (P45-P47) show demand values of 4364, 4530, and 4595, indicating a steady but slow upward creep or high-level volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To prevent stockouts (ending inventory was 0 in P46 and P47), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this most recent plateau level (P43-P47). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~4376) and standard deviation of this stable but high regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at a higher level: 5-period average (P43-P47) is approximately 4377 units, representing a minor increase from the ~4200-4300 level previously observed.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent upward trajectory throughout the game, recently stabilizing into a high-level plateau that continues to experience minor growth. The 5-period average (P44-P48) is approximately 4541.8 units, which is higher than the previously identified ~4377 level from Period 47. Period 48 demand recorded 4776 units, the highest in the sequence. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arriving same-period), which has been stable for 48 periods. To address the persistent stockouts (inventory ending at 0 for the last 3 periods), I will set mu_hat to be slightly aggressive using an explicit value based on the most recent demand (4776) and the average growth trend, approximately 4800, to ensure the backend OR logic doesn't cap the order below actual demand needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau continues to rise slightly: the 5-period average (P44-P48) is 4541.8 units, a ~4% increase over the P43-P47 average (~4377).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new high of 5,087 units in Period 49. The 5-period average (P45-P49) is now 4,670 units, reflecting a clear increase from the previous plateau of ~4,377 units. Stockouts persist as demand consistently outstrips inventory levels. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-day arrival) throughout the game's history. To address the rapid growth and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime, and keeping L at its promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated starting Period 47: the 3-period average (P47-P49) is 4,819 units, an 8% increase over the P44-P46 average of 4,446 units.
