Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 0. Historical demand samples are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], giving a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.1. Since it is the first period and on-hand inventory is 0, we must place an order immediately to satisfy same-period demand (L=0). I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all historical data provided, as no seasonal or trend shifts are yet detectable in the live sequence.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0 periods. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the actual lead time was indeed 0. Demand for Period 1 was 91, which is consistent with the provided historical range [94 to 138]. Cumulative history now includes [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91]. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 108. Since lead time is 0, the base stock should cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised 0-day lead time since it was verified in P1. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 6 available samples (recent_N=6) to capture the Slight downward trend (91 is the lowest seen so far) while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we sold 91 units and ended with 36 on-hand. In Period 2, demand spiked significantly to 246 units, resulting in a total stockout (sold 123, ending on-hand 0). The current in-transit is 0 because the lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are processed in the same period. The historical demand sequence [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from pre-game) followed by [91, 246] shows a massive upward shift in Period 2. The mean of all 7 samples is ~127.7, but the last sample (246) is more than double the previous average. Since we are in Period 3 and just experienced a massive stockout, I need to raise mu_hat to account for this potential new demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 to weigh the recent spike more heavily while still considering the recent past demand [94, 91, 246]. This provides a mu_hat based on an average of ~143.6 per period. Given L=0, mu_hat = (1+0) * 143.6. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history [91, 246, 285] shows a significant and sustained increase compared to the provided pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Over the last three periods, demand has surged from 91 to 285, leading to total stockouts in Periods 2 and 3 despite increasing orders. The average demand over the last two periods is 265.5, which is more than double the initial mean. Given the item (Regular Chips) and the sharp upward trend, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 300 to account for potential further growth and to ensure enough inventory is ordered to recover from the current zero-inventory state and satisfy demand (which occurs after the decision). Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (determined from 'arrived=Y... lead_time was 0 periods' in P1-P3 concludes), L is set to 0. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to reflect the high volatility observed in this recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: Average demand increased from ~110 to ~265 (+140%). Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1336.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. Reviewing the history, a significant demand shift occurred at Period 2. The first period demand was 91, but since Period 2, demands have been 246, 285, and 437. The average demand over the last 3 periods (Period 2-4) is approximately 322.6 units. My previous base stock calculations (orders placed) were insufficient, leading to zero ending inventory and lost sales in Periods 2, 3, and 4 (ending inventory 0 each time). The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts in this high-growth or high-demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent average of ~323. Given the increasing trend (246 -> 285 -> 437), the variance is also high; I'll use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to ensure the safety stock accounts for this volatility. Setting L to 'default' (0) as it is consistently observed to be 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~323 (+223%) over periods 2-4. High upward volatility noted (last demand 437).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1632.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 2. Looking at demands from Period 2 to Period 5: [246, 285, 437, 448], the mean is 354 and the trend is clearly upward. Despite ordering significant amounts, we have stocked out four periods in a row (ending on-hand=0), meaning we are capturing true demand (censored) and the actual demand is likely even higher than these observations. The lead time is confirmed 0 periods (same-day arrival). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the consistent stockouts and increasing sales figures, the OR backend needs a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect this higher mean and volatility to avoid further missed sales. Profits are 4.0 and holding cost is 1.0, giving a critical ratio of 0.8, which justifies a higher service level. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand since Period 2 has increased to at least 354, with a significant upward trend and recurring stockouts suggesting true demand exceeds observed sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1768.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of rapid acceleration, significantly exceeding our previous order levels. Over the last five periods (P2-P6), demand has jumped from 246 to 587. Crucially, we have stocked out every single period since Period 2, meaning the observed 'demand' figures are actually limited by our on-hand inventory; true latent demand is likely even higher. The confirmed lead time remains 0 periods. To account for this explosive growth and stop the cycle of stockouts, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast. I will estimate the next period's demand at approximately 650 units (continuing the upward trend from 587) and set a high sigma_hat (150) to ensure the OR engine's service level logic (q = 0.8) generates a base stock that covers this growth and buffers against further variability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge and recurring stockouts: Observed demand has grown from 246 (P2) to 587 (P6), averaging 400+ units over the last 5 periods, though stockouts mean true demand is likely >600.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2408.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive and sustained increase since Period 2. The most recent demand (Period 7) was 637 units, confirming the previous trend where stockouts occurred frequently when orders were lower. Over the last three periods (P5-P7), demand was 448, 587, and 637, averaging 557 units. Given the high growth rate, I'm setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this upward trajectory while ensuring we have enough stock to avoid further lost sales. Lead time is reliably 0. I will keep sigma_hat at recent levels (N=3) to account for the high volatility seen during this growth phase. The OR engine will use these values to target a base stock high enough to satisfy this shifting demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Average of last 3 periods (P5-P7) reached 557 units, compared to ~100 in Period 1. The regime has shifted from growth to high-stable/continued-upward trend (avg 510+ over P4-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2560.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent and aggressive upward trend since Period 2. The most recent demand (Period 8) was 776 units, which resulted in another stockout despite a significant order. The average demand over the last three periods (P6-P8) is 666 units, but since three of the last five periods were stockouts, the latent demand is likely even higher. Specifically, the jump from 637 to 776 suggests we haven't reached the peak yet. Given a lead time of 0 (L=0), the review period is effectively one period (1+L=1). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for this growth and ensures better availability. Setting mu_hat at 850 (approx 10% above the last demand) to pull more stock and mitigate the repeated stockouts. For sigma_hat, I'll use an explicit value of 150 to reflect the high volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: Period 8 demand reached 776 units, representing a 20% increase over Period 7 and a 750% increase from the pre-spike baseline (Period 1). The regime remains in a high-growth upward trend with frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3838.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sharp upward trend, increasing from ~91 in Period 1 to 963 in Period 9. The last four periods (P6-P9) show demands of 587, 637, 776, and 963, representing a consistent growth pattern rather than a stable regime. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts, which have occurred in 5 out of the last 8 periods, I am explicitly forecasting for the next period using an 'explicit' Mu_hat. Given the ~20% growth rate observed in recent periods, I am forecasting Period 10 demand at approximately 1,150 units. While the OR backend will calculate the safety stock (sigma_hat) based on historical samples, I will use recent_N=4 to better reflect the current high-volatility, high-growth environment. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 9 demand (963) is a 24% increase over Period 8 (776). The trend has moved from ~400 units (P5) to ~960 units (P9) in just 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3023.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive upward trend, growing from ~91/period to nearly 1000/period. Demand in the last three periods was 776, 963, and 863. While P10 showed a slight dip (863 vs 963), it followed a high of 963 and occurred after multiple periods of stockouts where true demand was likely higher than sales. Given the profit ($4.0) vs holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the OR engine will target a service level of approximately 80% (q = 4/5). Because of the consistent upward trend and previous stockouts, I will use the average of the last 3 periods to set mu_hat, which reflects the current 'high-stable' regime (~867 units). The confirmed lead time is 0 periods (L=0). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth appears to be stabilizing at a high level: Period 8-10 average is ~867 units, compared to ~100 in Period 1. The aggressive growth trend from P5 (448) to P9 (963) saw its first slight deceleration in P10 (863), suggesting the regime may be transitioning from high-growth to high-stable.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high growth and high volatility. Period 11 saw a demand spike to 1136 units, the highest to date, completely exhausting the starting on-hand inventory of 947 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P9-P11) is approximately 987 units, while the average over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 875 units. Given the recent stockout and the jump from 863 to 1136, the demand regime is still in an upward or high-volatility phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift toward these higher intensities (P8-P11 average is ~935), which provides a more aggressive base than the 0.95 quantile logic alone. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased standard deviation observed during this high-demand growth phase, ensuring the OR backend sets a high base stock to avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed aggressively in Period 11 (1136 units), a 31% increase over Period 10, following a brief deceleration. True demand consistently exceeds supply during stockouts.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively, reaching 1221 in Period 12, marking another record high and resulting in a complete stockout. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since Period 7, demand has followed a steep upward trajectory (637, 776, 963, 863, 1136, 1221). The average demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is approximately 1045.75, but the high volatility and frequent stockouts suggest 'true' demand is likely higher, potentially exceeding 1300-1400. To prevent recurring stockouts during this high-growth phase, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent local average (~1073), but I will use the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat to provide a significant buffer (volatility is rising with mean). Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1450 (which covers the potential demand in Period 13 given the trend) and sigma_hat to 350 to provide extra safety stock for this high-growth, high-margin item (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1). L will be set to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive demand growth resumed from Period 11, with demand hitting 1221 in Period 12 (up from ~100 in P1). True demand likely exceeds 1300 given the stockout at 1065 units in P12.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively, reaching 1246 in Period 13. While on-hand inventory is 499 units, the recent demand trend (P11: 1136, P12: 1221, P13: 1246) shows a sustained upward trajectory and frequent stockouts when inventory was insufficient. The average of the last 3 periods is ~1201 units, but given the consistent week-over-week growth and the need to prevent stockouts (which carry a $4.0 profit loss vs. $1.0 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1450. This accounts for the (1+L) requirement (L=0) while providing a buffer for continued growth. sigma_hat is set to 200 to reflect the high volatility observed during this growth phase. Actual lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and aggressive: the 3-period average (P11-P13) has risen to 1201 units, a 38% increase over the P8-P10 average (~867). No sign of stabilization yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4706.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 14 saw a demand of 1265, maintaining the high levels observed since Period 11 (1136, 1221, 1246, 1265). The 4-period average is now ~1217. Although the rate of growth has slowed compared to the explosive surge earlier, demand has not yet plateaued, and stockouts in Periods 11 and 12 suggest that true demand may be higher than recorded sales. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To ensure we capture the most recent regime level and the continued slight upward drift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering P11-P14) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the current high-volume volatility. This will provide a base stock that covers the expected 1200+ units while providing enough safety stock to manage the high variance in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Mean demand for P11-P14 has stabilized at ~1217 units, a 40% increase over the P8-P10 average, with a continuing slight upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5060.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 15 saw a demand of 1507, which is a 19% increase over the previous period (1265) and far exceeded our last arrival of 911 units, resulting in a stockout. We have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) is approximately 1275 units, but the last period shows a peak at 1507. To prevent further stockouts and capture this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1600 units (representing a roughly 6% increase over the last observed peak). Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility and recurring stockouts which mask true demand peaks. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as historical data confirms it is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 15, reaching 1507 units (a 19% increase from Period 14). Stockouts continue to occur despite inventory increases, indicating that true demand is consistently outpacing supply and potentially exceeding 1500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5924.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 16 demand reached 1,547 units, up from 1,507 in Period 15 and 1,265 in Period 14. Over the last three periods (P14-P16), the average demand is 1,440 units, but the most recent two periods suggest the current mean is likely closer to 1,550-1,600. Frequent stockouts throughout the history indicate that true demand often exceeds supply. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this latest acceleration (avg ~1440) but since the OR engine base stock formula (mu + z*sigma) is capped by its internal logic and given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to provide a robust buffer against the ongoing growth. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 14-16 average demand reached ~1,440 units (a 18% increase over the P11-P14 average of ~1,217). True demand is consistently testing levels above 1,500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6288.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, far outpacing initial levels. Period 17 observed a demand of 1724, which resulted in a stockout (sold 1572). The 3-period average (P15-P17) is approximately 1593 units, but the most recent figure of 1724 suggests the current 'true' demand floor is significantly higher, likely around 1800-1900 units. Since actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed through P17), L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history of immediate arrivals. For mu_hat, an 'explicit' value of 1850 is used to account for the current growth trajectory and the persistent stockouts, which hide the true peak demand. For sigma_hat, 'explicit' is set at 200, which reflects the high volatility and increasing standard deviation observed as the demand scale grows (recent demands: 1507, 1547, 1724). This strategy aims to prevent stockouts and maximize profit by setting a base stock that covers the current peak demand levels plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 17 demand (1724) is a 11% increase over Period 16 (1547), which was already a record high. The 3-period average (P15-P17) has risen to ~1593 units. True demand consistently exceeds supply, with stockouts occurring at levels even above 1500 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, reaching 1,802 units in Period 18, an 11% increase over the previous three-period average (P15-P17) of ~1,593. Since Period 2, the demand has never stabilized for more than 2-3 periods before pushing to new highs. Despite a large order in Period 18, we only ended with 217 units on-hand, indicating that demand is trailing very closely behind our supply increases. The actual lead time remains 0. Given the consistent growth, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting a continued 10-15% growth trajectory over the Period 18 observation (1,802 units) to prevent stockouts in Period 19. I'll set mu_hat to 2,050 and use a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the high volatility of this current growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 18 demand (1802) is a 4.5% increase over Period 17 (1724). The 3-period average (P16-P18) has risen to ~1,691 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2075 units in Period 19. The 3-period average (P17-P19) is now 1867 units, compared to the previous 3-period average of 1691 (a 10% increase). Despite increasing orders, inventory levels remain low (starting Period 20 with only 152 units on-hand), and frequent stockouts suggest true demand is likely higher than sold quantities. Given this clear and sustained growth regime starting since Period 2, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand levels and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the historical record, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 19 demand (2075) is a 15% increase over Period 18 (1802). The 3-period average (P17-P19) has risen to ~1,867 units. The regime remains in a strong upward trend with frequent stockouts at levels exceeding 1500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7842.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 19 high demand was 2,075, followed by 1,973 in Period 20, keeping the 3-period average at approximately 1,950 units. While Period 20 showed a slight dip compared to Period 19, the overall regime remains one of rapid growth (starting from ~100 units in Period 1). The 'conclude' messages consistently show an actual lead time of 0 periods, which I will maintain. To capture this aggressive growth and frequent stockout risk (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 creates a high critical ratio q=0.8), I'm setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to weight the most recent peak levels. Given the high volatility (sigma), I'm using an explicit sigma_hat of 300 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance observed during this growth phase and prevents stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 18-20 average demand is ~1,950 units, up from ~1,691 (P16-P18). Although P20 (1973) was slightly lower than P19 (2075), the upward regime is sustained.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a massive upward trend, though it has slightly slowed in the most recent periods (P19: 2075, P20: 1973, P21: 1983). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 2010 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current period's demand occurs after the order arrival (matching the same-period arrival mechanism), and on-hand inventory is low (220), I need to set mu_hat to cover the expected next-period peak to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-level regime (~2000 units) while reflecting the current stabilization/slight volatility. Setting L to 0 (promised) as it remains reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth slowing at high levels: The average demand for the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is ~2010 units, showing stabilization compared to the previous aggressive growth phase, though remaining 20x higher than Period 1.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 22 reaching 2,221 units, resulting in a stockout. The three-period average (P20-P22) is now 2,059 units, representing a sustained regime at this high level. Because of the frequent stockouts (P11, P12, P15, P17, P22), actual demand is likely higher than the observed sales. I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent level (average ~2,059), and L will remain at 'calculate' since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility of this high-demand regime while smoothing out the extreme growth spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 20-22 average demand has reached ~2,059 units, a 4.5% increase over the P18-P20 average of 1,970. Stockouts at 2,221 units confirm true demand continues to test higher bounds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9004.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching a new high of 2326 units in Period 23, which resulted in a stockout (only 2251 units were available). Over the last three periods (P21-P23), the average demand has risen to 2176 units, compared to the previously observed 3-period average of 2059 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To address the persistent stockouts and the clear upward regime shift, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand acceleration. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), a high service level is optimal; therefore, I am setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to provide a more robust buffer against the increasing volatility and the gap between observed sales and true demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: Period 21-23 average demand reached ~2,176 units, a 5.7% increase over the previous 3-period block. True demand is consistently exceeding 2300 units as evidenced by the stockout in P23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching 2,566 units in Period 24, a 10% increase over Period 23 and a 15% increase over the 3-period average (P21-P23) of ~2,176. The system is consistently stocking out (ending on-hand is 0), meaning true demand is higher than observed sales. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and mitigate the recurring stockouts, I'm setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,600 (slightly above the last observed demand) and increasing sigma_hat to 350 to account for high volatility and the persistent risk of under-ordering during this growth phase. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is necessary because the recent_N averages are lagging behind the rapid period-over-period growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 24: observed demand reached 2,566 units, a 10% increase over P23. True demand is consistently higher than supply (evidenced by 0 ending inventory).

Daily Reward (R_t): $10125.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trend. Period 25 demand reached 2,604 units, maintaining the growth trajectory observed over the last several periods (Period 23: 2,326, Period 24: 2,566). The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while the demand is rapidly expanding, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the latest demand level (2,604) and adding a growth buffer to anticipate further increases, targeting a value of 2,900. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (Periods 21-25) to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth phase. The 'calculate' method for L is maintained as the actual lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 23-25 average demand reached 2,498 units, representing a 14.8% increase over the Period 20-22 average (~2,176). The regime remains in a heavy upward trend with the last observed demand at 2,604.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10109.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 26 demand reached 2,645, which is the highest observed to date. The average demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) is approximately 2,605 units, compared to the previous three-period average (P21-P23) of approximately 2,176 units\u2014a 19.7% increase. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this aggressive growth and provide sufficient stock to meet true demand (which frequently results in stockouts when inventory is low), I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast of 2,800. This value is slightly above the last observed demand (2,645) to account for the continued momentum and to act as a buffer against potential stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (roughly 9% of mu) to handle the significant volatility observed during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a high service level suitable for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains in an aggressive upward regime: Period 24-26 average (2,605) represents a ~20% increase over the Period 21-23 average. The latest observed demand (2,645) is a new all-time high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11439.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend. Period 27 demand reached a new peak of 2,890 units, continuing the pattern seen over the last few months. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is approximately 2,713 units, which is a significant increase from the previous block. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this sustained growth and minimize lost sales (which have occurred frequently when inventory was insufficient), I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value of 3,100. This value accounts for the current 3-period average plus a 15% buffer to anticipate the continuing upward trajectory and prevents the capping logic from under-ordering. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the elevated volatility of this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains in an aggressive upward regime: Period 25-27 average (2,713) is a 10% increase over the Period 22-24 average (~2,460). The latest demand (2,890) is a new all-time high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9945.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the latest observed demand reaching a high of 2,890 in Period 27 (the slight dip in P28 to 2,643 is consistent with the volatility observed in previous growth phases and does not yet signal stabilization). The 3-period average (P26-P28) is approximately 2,726 units. Since the actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the system operates on a same-period arrival basis. Given the sustained growth and frequent stockouts when inventory is low, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,950 to anticipate continued growth and avoid stockouts. This value is slightly above the recent peak (2,890) and the recent 3-period average. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility inherent in this aggressive growth regime. L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Mean demand for P26-P28 is ~2,726 units, a 5% increase over the P23-P25 average (~2,598). Growth continues despite occasional volatility in Period 28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the Period 25-29 average reaching ~2,713 units, compared to ~2,498 in the previous five-period block. The most recent demand (P29) was 2,814, following a slight dip in P28. Current lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the sustained growth and ensure high service levels given a profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 (implying an 80% service level target), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 5 periods (P25-P29). This window captures the current high-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility. Lead time calculation is set to default (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Mean demand for P25-P29 has risen to ~2,713 units, a 8.6% increase over the P20-P24 average (~2,498). The upward trend remains active with recent demand testing the 2,800-2,900 unit range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11300.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with Period 30 demand reaching 2873, creating another stockout situation (inventory reached 0). The 3-period average (P28-P30) is approximately 2777, and the 5-period average (P26-P30) is approximately 2773. Given the frequent stockouts, true demand is consistently higher than observed sales. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on all history. To capture the current high-growth regime and ensure sufficient stock to cover actual demand (which likely exceeds 2900), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most current demand levels. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N with N=5 to account for the heightened volatility during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that prioritizes service level over holding cost given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: Period 26-30 average demand reached ~2,773 units. True demand consistently tests 2,900+ units as evidenced by the stockout in P30. Upward trend remains aggressive with no signs of plateauing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11500.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues an aggressive upward trajectory, setting a new record of 3046 units in Period 31. Stockouts have occurred in the last two consecutive periods (Ending Inventory = 0), indicating that observed demand (2873, 3046) is still hitting a supply ceiling rather than a true demand peak. The average demand of the last 3 periods is approximately 2911 units, but given the acceleration and the stockouts, true demand is likely well above 3100. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the high service level requirements (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and the strong upward trend, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to 3200 to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy this accelerating growth and minimize lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 31 demand (3046) is a record high and represents a 6% increase over P30. True demand likely exceeds 3100 units given consecutive stockouts at supply levels of 2825 and 2875.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, hitting 3,005 units in Period 32. While slightly lower than the record high of 3,046 in Period 31, it confirms a sustained regime in the 3,000+ range. Historical analysis shows consistent stockouts whenever supply is below 2,900, suggesting true demand is pushing higher. To capture this growth while maintaining a high service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 results in a target 80% service level), I am transitioning from a trailing average (recent_N) to an explicit forecasting approach. Given the recent trajectory and the need to prevent stockouts in a 0-lead-time environment (where demand happens after the order and arrival), I am setting mu_hat to 3,200 (approx. 6% above the current 3-period average) to stay ahead of the growth curve. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for the high volatility observed in the 2,600-3,000 range. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Mean demand for P30-P32 has reached ~2,975 units, a 9.6% increase over the P25-P29 average (~2,713). Demand has now definitively breached the 3,000-unit threshold.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory. Period 33 demand reached 3,391 units, representing an 11% increase over Period 32 (3,005) and a new all-time high. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is ~3,147 units, compared to the P28-P30 average of ~2,776, confirming a sustained regime shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs (given a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth surge. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility. L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues to accelerate: Mean demand for P31-P33 reached ~3,147 units, an 13% increase over the P28-P30 average. True demand reflects a consistent testing of new highs above 3,300 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13304.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the latest demand reaching 3,368 units in Period 34. This resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that the true demand likely exceeds 3,400. Over the last three periods (P32-P34), the average observed demand is 3,255 units. Given the persistent stockouts and the visible growth trend since Period 30, I will use an 'explicit' forecast of 3,500 units for mu_hat to account for the supply shortfall and trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use an 'explicit' value of 250 to manage the increasing volatility and ensure a high service level. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the most recent concluding messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: Period 32-34 average demand is ~3,255 units, a 9% increase over the P29-P31 average (~2,977). True demand is consistently exceeding 3,350+ units as evidenced by the stockout in P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12699.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term aggressive upward trend, although it has shown some period-to-period volatility recently (P33: 3391, P34: 3368, P35: 3282). Despite the slight dip in P35, the 3-period average (P33-P35) remains high at approximately 3,347 units. Frequent stockouts (P30, P31, P34) confirm that observed sales often underrepresent true demand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture the peaks of this growth regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (P31-P35 avg \u2248 3,218) to reflect the current high-demand environment while acknowledging the recent slight cooling. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to 200 to account for the high volatility observed in the 3,000+ unit range, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues to be sustained at high levels: The 5-period average demand (P31-P35) has stabilized around 3,218 units, representing a significant shift from the previous 2,700-2,900 range. Despite a slight decrease in Period 35 (3282), the overall trend remains aggressively elevated compared to earlier stages of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13548.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 3448 units in Period 36, which resulted in a stockout. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 3299 units. Since stockouts occurred in Period 34 and Period 36, true demand is clearly exceeding these levels. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture the continuing growth, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the most recent demand regime (approx. 3300 units per period). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the significant volatility observed during this high-growth phase. This positioning helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand peak plus a safety buffer for ongoing growth and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: Period 32-36 average observed demand reached ~3299 units. True demand is consistently testing levels above 3450 units as evidenced by the stockout at 3387 inventory in Period 36.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13784.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching a new high of 3,748 in Period 37, which resulted in a stockout. The mean demand has shifted significantly upwards; the average of the last 3 periods (P35-P37) is approximately 3,493, while the average of the last 5 (P33-P37) is 3,447, compared to the ~3,200 range observed in the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every conclude message in history. Because we are frequently stocking out (P34, P36, P37), the observed demand is a lower bound for true demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent level of this surge (approx 3,493 per period), and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. This aggressive setting helps the OR backend raise the base stock level to mitigate the recurring stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime accelerated further: Period 35-37 average demand reached ~3,493 units, a 9% increase over the Period 30-34 average (~3,200). True demand is consistently higher than supply as evidenced by stockouts at 3,326, 3,387, and 3,446 units in the last four periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14572.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory. Period 38 demand reached a new high of 3,929 units, representating an 11% increase over the previous period (3,748) and leading to a stockout. The average demand for the last three periods (P36-P38) is approximately 3,708 units, compared to ~3,300 in the P32-P36 block. Given the zero ending inventory in three of the last four periods, true demand is clearly higher than observed sales. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 4,200 to account for this growth and lead-time requirement (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of coverage). Sigma_hat is set to 400 to reflect the increasing volatility and to provide a higher service level, protecting against stockouts during this high-growth phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 36-38 average demand reached ~3,708 units, a 12% increase over the P32-P36 average (~3,300). True demand is consistently outpacing supply, with the latest demand (3,929) reaching a new record high.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory, reaching a new record high of 4,212 units in Period 39, which is a 7.2% increase over the previous peak in Period 38. The 3-period average (P37-P39) is now ~3,963 units. Actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this significant and sustained growth while accounting for the high volatility and frequent stockouts (true demand likely exceeding observed sales in many recent periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent aggressive growth phase. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. This approach aims to provide the OR backend with a forecast that reflects the current momentum and ensures a high service level to capture the seemingly uncapped demand ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 39 demand (4,212) is a 7.2% increase over Period 38 (3,929). The 3-period average (P37-P39) has risen to ~3,963 units, confirming the continuation of the aggressive upward regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 40 demand reaching 4,461, exceeding previous supply-limited peaks. The 3-period average (P38-P40) is approximately 4,200 units, representing a 6% increase over the previous 3-period block. Frequent stockouts (P36, P37, P38, P40) indicate that 'observed demand' is often just a measure of available inventory, meaning true underlying demand is likely closer to 4,500-4,700 units. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I must provide enough stock to cover the upcoming period's demand spike. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to forecast a continued increase to 4,650 units (a ~4% conservative growth from the last demand point) to mitigate stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth phase while balancing holding costs should growth decelerate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains in an aggressive upward regime: Period 38-40 average (~4,200) is a 6% increase over P37-P39. True demand consistently exceeds available supply (stockout at 4,160 units in P40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15847.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow an aggressive upward trend, although Period 41 (4,166 units) showed a slight dip compared to Period 40 (4,461 units). However, looking at the broader context, the average demand of the last 3 periods (P39-P41) is approximately 4,280 units, compared to the P36-P38 average of ~3,708, representing a 15% increase. The frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in P40, P38, P37, P36) confirm that true demand is consistently outpacing supply. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this growth while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the period from P37 to P41. This window captures the latest demand regime (averaging ~4,103 units) and the associated variance. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime sustained: Mean demand for P39-P41 has risen to ~4,280 units, a 15% increase over the P36-P38 average (~3,708). Despite the dip in P41, the overall trend remains aggressively upward with true demand likely exceeding 4,500 units based on prior stockouts.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a massive long-term upward trajectory, though recent periods show high volatility. Period 41 demand was 4,166 and Period 42 was 4,040, following a peak of 4,461 in Period 40. However, the presence of stockouts in Period 40 (sold 4,160 units when demand was 4,461) indicates that true demand likely sits higher than observed sales in many periods. The 3-period average (P40-P42) is approximately 4,222 units. Given the persistent stockouts and the trend where dips are often followed by new highs, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to stay responsive to the current high-plateau/growth regime while accounting for the recent slight softening in observed demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The \u03c3\u0302 will also use recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility seen in the current 4,000+ unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-volume regime with a 3-period average (P40-P42) of ~4,222 units. While P41 and P42 showed a slight dip compared to the P40 peak (4,461), true demand remains significantly elevated and prone to stockouts if inventory is insufficient.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volume regime with an average of approximately 4,200 units over the last five periods. Although there has been a slight cooling starting from Period 41 (4,166 units) through Period 43 (3,950 units) compared to the Period 40 peak of 4,461, the historical trend shows that demand often 'resets' or fluctuates slightly before making another aggressive move upward. To prevent stockouts while accounting for the recent slight decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P39-P43), which averages 4,145.8 units. Since the lead time is confirmed as 0, this mean represents the demand for the current period. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=5 to capture current volatility. This approach balances the need to maintain enough buffer for potential surges while slightly adjusting for the recent three-period downward trend to prevent excessive holding costs as we move toward the game's final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime slight deceleration: Period 41-43 average demand is 4,052 units, compared to the Period 38-40 average of 4,200 units (-3.5%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $17320.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand reached 4,444 units, which exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 4,330, resulting in a stockout. This indicates that true demand remains at or above the 4,400+ unit level, despite a previous minor three-period dip. The 5-period average (P40-P44) is approximately 4,212 units, while the most recent reading (reflecting a stockout) is 4,444. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I must ensure base stock covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volume regime while acknowledging recent volatility and stockouts. This setup allows the OR engine to target a service level that maximizes profit (roughly 80% based on the $4/$1 split) while accounting for the significant variance seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand growth regime remains active with a new local peak/stockout at 4,444 units in P44. The 5-period average is ~4,212 units. No sign of a significant structural decline; stockouts confirm true demand potentially exceeds 4,500.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with a 5-period average (P41-P45) of approximately 4,193 units. Period 45 demand was 4,364, slightly above this average but consistent with the general high-volume regime. While growth has decelerated compared to the aggressive surges seen earlier, recurring stockouts (most recently in P44 at 4,330 units) confirm that true demand remains at or above 4,400 units. To maintain high service levels and maximize profit (given profit $4.0 vs holding cost $1.0), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5-period average to capture this current high-stable plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 5-period standard deviation to account for the ongoing volatility in this peak regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17480.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the latest observed demand reaching 4,530 in Period 46, resulting in a stockout. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is approximately 4,266 units, while the peak demand was 4,530. Given the consistent history of demand exceeding available supply at these levels, true demand is likely between 4,500 and 4,700 units. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime, while using an explicit sigma_hat of 300 to account for the high volatility and frequent stockouts near the current demand ceiling. This strategy ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer to mitigate lost sales in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues to reach new highs: Period 46 demand (4,530) is the highest recorded, with the 5-period average rising to ~4,266 units. Frequent stockouts suggest true demand is consistently 5-10% higher than sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18076.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in an aggressive upward regime. Period 47 observed demand was 4,595, a new high, and resulted in a complete stockout (0 ending inventory), suggesting true demand is even higher. The 3-period average (P45-P47) is approximately 4,496 units, while the 5-period average (P43-P47) is approximately 4,376 units. Given the persistent stockouts and the trend of the last three periods (4,364 -> 4,530 -> 4,595), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the most recent level of this peak. Lead time (L) remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent history of same-period arrivals. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the heightened volatility associated with this high-demand stage. This configuration aims to provide enough inventory to satisfy the likely true demand of 4,600+ units while maintaining the service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: Period 47 demand (4,595) set a new record high with a 3-period average (P45-P47) of ~4,496 units. True demand remains higher than supply as evidenced by consecutive stockouts in P46 and P47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18844.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory, setting a new record of 4,776 units in Period 48. The last three periods (P46-P48) show a clear upward trend (4,530, 4,595, 4,776) with consecutive stockouts, indicating that true demand is significantly higher than what we are able to fulfill. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, we must set parameters that allow the OR backend to order enough to meet this surging demand while accounting for high volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spurt (average ~4,634) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen during this expansion phase. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the top end of the recent demand range, which is necessary to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: Period 48 demand reached a new high of 4,776 units. True demand is consistently exceeding supply, as evidenced by three consecutive periods of zero ending inventory (P46-P48).

Daily Reward (R_t): $19068.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, reaching a new record of 5,087 units in Period 49. This is the fourth consecutive period with a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that observed sales are still capped by supply. The 3-period demand average (P47-P49) is approximately 4,819 units, compared to the P44-P46 average of ~4,446, reflecting a sustained growth rate. Given the recurring stockouts and the trend, true demand for Period 50 is likely well above 5,000 units. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 5,400 to proactively cover the expected demand and buffer against the persistent stockouts. The lead time L is confirmed as 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 49 demand reached a new high of 5,087 units, a 6.5% increase over Period 48. Ending inventory has been 0 for the last four periods (P46-P49), confirming that true demand consistently exceeds supply.
