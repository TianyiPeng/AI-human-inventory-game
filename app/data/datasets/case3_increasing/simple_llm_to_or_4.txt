Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods shows values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average demand over this period is 111.4 units. There is no clear linear trend, as the values fluctuate significantly (Standard Deviation of ~17). The most recent value was 94, following a peak of 138. Since no specific calendar date or event info is provided for Period 1 beyond the index, I will rely on the mean of the historical window to stabilize the forecast against recent volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for 'chips(Regular)' shows a range between 94 and 138, with an average of approximately 111.4. The most recent observation (Period 1) recorded a demand of 91 units, which is slightly below the historical average but consistent with the lower end of the previous range (94). There is no specific calendar information or significant trend established yet to suggest a major departure from the baseline. I will forecast a slight recovery toward the historical mean while acknowledging the recent lower value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for chips(Regular) showed a mean of 111.4 with relatively low variance. However, the observed demand in the test phase has shifted significantly. Period 1 was slightly below the historical average (91 vs 111), but Period 2 showed a major spike to 246 units (a +120% increase over the baseline). This suggests a potential promotional event, seasonal shift, or external demand driver not explicitly defined in the dates. Given the sharp increase in Period 2, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially regress slightly from the peak as the immediate impact of a spike often tapers or stabilizes. I will forecast a value reflecting this higher demand level while awaiting more data to confirm a permanent regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for chips(Regular) showed a stable demand mean of approximately 111. However, the observed demand in the current test phase indicates a significant regime shift. Period 1 started slightly lower (91), but Periods 2 and 3 showed a dramatic and sustained increase (246 and 285 respectively). This suggests a new demand level or a specific event/seasonal driver. Given the jump from ~100 to ~260+, it is likely that demand will remain at this higher plateau for Period 4. I am forecasting a slight continued upward momentum based on the trend between Period 2 and 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: Average demand increased from baseline (~110) to a new level (~265), reflecting a potential 140% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1436.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand was stable around 110. Since Period 2, there has been a significant and sustained upward shift. Demand jumped from 91 (P1) to 246 (P2), then 285 (P3), and reached 437 in Period 4. This represents a clear upward trend and a regime change. The average over the last three periods is approximately 323, but the most recent value (437) suggests the trend is still climbing or experiencing high volatility at this new level. Given the sharp increase of 152 units between P3 and P4, I anticipate another increase, though perhaps moderated to account for potential peaking or variance. A forecast of 490 follows the trajectory established in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P2-P4), with the average shifting from ~110 to ~323, peaking at 437 in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1649.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically (Training Period and Period 1), demand was around 90-110 units. Starting from Period 2, there has been a sustained and accelerating upward trend. The last four periods (P2: 246, P3: 285, P4: 437, P5: 448) show a clear increase, though the growth rate between P4 and P5 slowed significantly (only +2.5%). Given the sharp increase followed by a potential stabilization at this higher level, I expect Period 6 to stay near the current peak, accounting for slight continued momentum while acknowledging the tapering growth rate.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization after growth spike: Growth rate slowed significantly in P5 (+2.5%) compared to P4 (+53%), suggesting demand may be plateauing at a new mean of ~440-450 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2296.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant and sustained upward trajectory since Period 2. After a period of apparent stabilization (Period 4 at 437 and Period 5 at 448), the demand jumped significantly in Period 6 to 587 units, representing a 31% increase. There is no indication of seasonal cooling yet, and the most recent trend suggests the 'plateau' identified in Period 6 was a temporary consolidation before further growth. Weighting the most recent growth and the overall momentum, I expect demand to remain high or slightly increase.

Carry-over insight: Renewed upward momentum: After a brief plateau (P4-P5), demand spiked again in P6 to 587 units (+31%), establishing a new peak and suggesting the upward trend has not yet fully stabilized.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2421.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong, sustained upward trend. Over the last seven periods, demand has grown from 91 to 637 units. Specifically, the last four periods show a sequence of 437, 448, 587, and 637. The growth from P6 to P7 was 50 units (+8.5%), following a larger jump from P5 to P6 of 139 units (+31%). While the growth rate fluctuates, the momentum remains positive. Given the recent trajectory and the most recent increase of 50 units, I expect the demand to continue climbing toward the 700-unit threshold. I will project a similar absolute increase to the most recent period to account for the ongoing trend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward trend continues: Demand has risen for 6 consecutive periods (P2-P7), moving the 3-period moving average from 390 (P3-P5) to 557 (P5-P7), a 43% increase in the mean level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3023.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and aggressive upward trajectory since Period 2. The most recent observations are 587 (P6), 637 (P7), and 776 (P8). The week-over-week increases for the last three periods are +139 (P6), +50 (P7), and +139 (P8). The average growth over the last three periods is approximately 109 units per period. While the growth rate fluctuates, there is no evidence of a plateau yet. The trend suggests a continued push upwards. Given the jump from 637 to 776 (+21.8%), I anticipate another significant increase, though I will moderate it slightly to account for potential stabilization, targeting a level near the 900 mark.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth confirmed: Demand has increased for 7 consecutive periods (P2-P8). The 3-period moving average has accelerated from 557 (P5-P7) to 667 (P6-P8), a 20% increase in the immediate short-term mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3718.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown an extraordinary and sustained upward trend since Period 2. The sequence of growth rates over the last few periods is: P6 (+31%), P7 (+8.5%), P8 (+21.8%), and P9 (+24%). This indicates that the growth is not just linear but potentially accelerating or at least maintaining strong momentum. The absolute increase in the last period (P9) was +187 units. While the growth rate fluctuates, it has not shown signs of stabilizing or reverting to a mean. Given the recent trajectory and the jump from 776 to 963, I expect the demand to break the 1000-unit threshold in Period 10. I will project a growth of approximately 15-20% over the previous period, which aligns with recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Acceleration phase confirmed: Demand has increased for 8 consecutive periods. The absolute growth magnitude has expanded significantly, with P9 seeing the largest single-period increase (+187 units) compared to the previous average growth of ~100 units/period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a strong growth phase from Period 2 through Period 9, consistently hitting new peaks. However, Period 10 marks the first significant decline in demand since the growth began, dropping from 963 to 863 (-10.4%). This suggests a potential transition from a hyper-growth regime to a stabilization or correction phase. The 3-period moving average (P8-P10) is 867.3, which aligns closely with the most recent observation. Given the sharp drop in P10, I anticipate demand will either stabilize near this new level or continue a slight downward adjustment as the previous 'acceleration phase' reaches market saturation or a seasonal peak passes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth cycle peaking: After 8 consecutive periods of growth (P2-P9), Period 10 showed the first significant downturn (-10.4%), suggesting the previous hyper-growth regime has ended and demand is beginning to stabilize or mean-revert around the 860-900 unit range.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant long-term upward trajectory from Period 1 to Period 11. After a brief contraction in Period 10 (863 units), demand surged in Period 11 to a new high of 1136 units, a 31.6% increase. This indicates that the stabilization theory mentioned in Period 11's carry-over insight was premature, and the growth regime remains active. The recent 3-period moving average (P9-P11) is 987, but the momentum suggests a higher baseline. Given the historical volatility and the magnitude of the recent jump, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially experience a minor correction or consolidation following the massive Period 11 spike.

Carry-over insight: Growth regime resumed in Period 11: The downturn in Period 10 was a temporary outlier; demand surged to 1136, establishing a new mean level above 1000 units and invalidating the stabilization theory from the previous period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a strong and sustained upward trend. Since Period 2, demand has increased in 10 out of 11 periods. Period 10 was a brief dip (-10.4%), but momentum resumed in Period 11 (+31.6%) and continued in Period 12 (+7.5%). The average growth over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is approximately 110 units per period. The three-period moving average has risen from 987 (P9-P11) to 1073 (P10-P12). Given the consistent growth and the most recent increase from 1136 to 1221, I expect the upward trend to persist into Period 13, though potentially at a slightly decelerating percentage rate as the volume scales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth regime extension: Demand has recovered from the Period 10 dip to post two consecutive new highs in P11 and P12, with the mean level shifting from ~850-900 to >1150 units (+30% shift in baseline).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong and sustained upward growth regime. Following a temporary dip in Period 10 (863 units), the last three periods have established a new baseline significantly higher than previous levels (P11: 1136, P12: 1221, P13: 1246). While demand continues to grow, the rate of growth is showing signs of deceleration: from a 7.5% increase in P12 down to a 2% increase in P13. This suggests the product is transitioning from a high-acceleration phase to a more stable growth phase or a high-volume plateau. The forecast for Period 14 accounts for this continued but moderating growth, projecting a slight increase from P13 to reflect the ongoing positive momentum while acknowledging the slowing growth rate.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization within high-growth regime: Growth has slowed for two consecutive periods (7.5% in P12 to 2% in P13), suggesting demand is settling into a new high-volume mean above 1200 units after the rapid acceleration seen in Periods 2-11.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a massive growth trend from Period 2 through Period 11. However, since Period 12, the growth rate has significantly slowed: from 7.5% (P12) to 2.0% (P13) and 1.5% (P14). This indicates the product is entering a stabilization phase at a high-volume ceiling. Absolute growth in the last cycle was +19 units. I anticipate growth will continue at a marginal but decreasing rate, forecasting a slight increase over the Period 14 value.

Carry-over insight: Growth deceleration confirmed: The rate of demand increase has declined for three consecutive periods (7.5%, 2.0%, 1.5%) since Period 12, suggesting demand is plateauing at a new ceiling between 1250 and 1300 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5887.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant shift from the plateau observed between Periods 12 and 14. After three periods of decelerating growth (7.5%, 2.0%, 1.5%), Period 15 experienced a sharp 19.1% increase (from 1265 to 1507), invalidating the previous theory that demand was topping out at 1300. This suggests a new growth spurt or a higher demand regime. Given the historical pattern of chips(Regular) frequently exceeding previous growth expectations throughout this 15-period sequence, I will forecast a moderate continuation of this new momentum while accounting for potential volatility after a large jump.

Carry-over insight: Growth ceiling invalidated: Period 15 demand (1507) broke the anticipated 1300-unit plateau with a 19% single-period jump, signaling a structural shift or renewed growth cycle after a three-period slowdown.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive upward trend since Period 2. After a temporary slowing of growth in Periods 13-14 (plateauing around 1250), the demand surged again in Period 15 to 1507 (+19%) and continued rising in Period 16 to 1547 (+2.6%). While the growth rate from P15 to P16 has slowed, the overall momentum remains positive and the product moves through successive levels of higher demand. The 3-period moving average has jumped from 1244 (P12-P14) to 1439 (P14-P16). Given the pattern of growth, followed by minor deceleration before the next level, I anticipate a modest continued increase as the demand stabilizes at this new 1500+ unit regime.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a 1250-unit plateau to a new baseline above 1500 units, representing a ~20% step-level increase since Period 15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6608.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend with significant growth acceleration in recent periods. Following a brief period of stabilization (Periods 12-14), demand jumped to over 1500 units in Period 15 and has increased steadily since. Specifically, the last three periods show counts of 1507, 1547, and 1724. Period 17 saw a substantial increase of 177 units (+11.4%), marking the third consecutive period of growth over 1500. The growth mechanism appears robust, alternating between plateaus and sharp step-up phases. Given the momentum in Period 17 and the historical trend of multi-period growth cycles, I expect demand to increase again, though potentially at a slightly moderated pace compared to the recent large jump.

Carry-over insight: Renewed growth phase confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P15-P17) above the 1500-unit mark, with the mean shifting from ~1240 (P12-P14) to ~1590 (P15-P17), a 28% increase in the current baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6701.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, non-linear upward trend. Over the last four periods (P15-P18), demand has cleared the 1500-unit mark and reached a new peak of 1802. Analyzing the recent growth increments (+242, +40, +177, +78 since P14), there appears to be an alternating cycle of high and moderate growth. Given that P18 recorded a moderate increase (+4.5%), and the average growth over the last five periods is approximately 111 units per period, I expect a continuation of this momentum. Factoring in the trend's strength, the forecast for P19 projects a growth of approximately 130 units, aligning with the sustained trajectory identified in recent Carry-Over Insights.

Carry-over insight: Growth acceleration maintains: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P15-P18), shifting the 3-period moving average from 1440 (P14-P16) to 1691 (P16-P18), a 17.4% increase in the current high-volume baseline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained and accelerating hyper-growth phase. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has surged from 1265 to 2075, representing a total increase of 64%. Specifically, Period 19 saw a significant jump of 273 units (+15.1%) from Period 18. Historical patterns show that such large spikes are typically followed by a period of slower growth or a minor consolidation (e.g., P4 to P5 saw +2.5% after +53%; P15 to P16 saw +2.6% after +19%). Given the current trend, I anticipate demand will continue to rise but at a decelerated rate compared to the P19 spike. Using a conservative growth estimate of approximately 3-5% for the next period to account for potential stabilization after the recent surge.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth phase continues: Demand has increased for five consecutive periods (P15-P19), with the 3-period moving average rising from 1691 (P16-P18) to 1867 (P17-P19), a 10.4% increase. Period 19 established a new high-volume baseline above 2000 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained growth cycle since Period 15, peaking at 2075 in Period 19. Period 20 shows a slight pullback to 1973 (a 4.9% decrease), which mimics the pattern seen in Period 10 where a sharp growth phase was interrupted by a temporary minor decline before resuming an upward trajectory. The current 3-period moving average (P18-P20) is 1950, which is significantly higher than the previous 3-period average (P17-P19) of 1867. Given the historical behavior of this SKU, where growth plateaus or dips are often followed by stabilization at a new high baseline or continued growth, I expect demand to remain strong near the 2000-unit mark. I am forecasting a slight recovery towards the most recent peak without assuming a massive breakout, settling on a value that honors the established high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization at 2000-unit baseline: Period 20 saw the first decline (-5%) after a 5-period growth streak, suggesting demand is stabilizing at the 1900-2100 unit range after the hyper-growth phase from P15 onwards.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' has exhibited a significant long-term upward trend, growing from ~100 units to a peak of 2075 in Period 19. Recently, demand has shown signs of stabilization: Period 20 decreased to 1973 (-4.9%), and Period 21 showed a marginal increase to 1983 (+0.5%). This pattern of slowing growth mirrors previous consolidation phases seen in Periods 4-5 and Periods 12-14, where demand plateaued for 2-3 cycles before finding a new baseline or resuming growth. The current 3-period average (P19-P21) is 2010 units, while the most recent 2-period average is 1978 units. Given that the decline in P20 did not continue in P21, I anticipate Period 22 will remain within the established 1970-2000 unit range as the market consolidates at this new high-volume level.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory. Historical data shows a consistent pattern of multi-period growth phases followed by short periods of stabilization or minor retracement. Most recently, demand stabilized around the 1900-2000 range (Periods 19-21) before breaking out to a new all-time high of 2221 units in Period 22 (+12% growh). This breakout signals the start of a new growth leg, consistent with previous regime shifts where demand jumps to a higher baseline. Taking the most recent momentum and the historical step-level increases into account, I expect demand to follow the current upward trend into Period 23.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase confirmed in Period 22: Demand broke the 1900-2100 stabilization range with a 12% increase to 2221 units, signaling a shift toward a new baseline above 2200 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong and consistent upward trend. Over the last four periods, demand has moved from 1973 (P20) to 2326 (P23), representing an 18% increase in the baseline within a short interval. Specifically, Period 23 saw a growth of approximately 4.7% over Period 22 (2221 units). The carry-over insights highlight a history of rapid growth followed by brief stabilization phases; however, the current movement suggests a sustained climb toward a new baseline. Unlike the temporary dip in P20, Periods 21, 22, and 23 show consecutive growth from the 1900-2000 range into the 2300+ range. Based on the immediate growth rate (avg increase of ~114 units/period over the last 3 periods), the forecast for Period 24 assumes continued momentum within the current growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth regime (P21-P23): Demand has increased for three consecutive periods, shifting the baseline from ~1980 to over 2300 (+17%), moving past the previously anticipated 2000-unit stabilization point.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend with periodic step-closures and brief stabilization phases. The historical data shows a clear pattern of growth followed by short-term plateaus at increasing baselines. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has grown from 1983 to 2566, with the most recent Period 24 showing a significant acceleration (+10.3%) from Period 23. The 3-period moving average has shifted from 2059 (P20-P22) to 2371 (P22-P24), representing a 15% increase in the current high-demand baseline. Given that Period 24 established a new record high without signs of immediate deceleration, I am forecasting a continuation of this growth, tempered slightly by a conservative growth rate expectation typical of previous long-duration trends in this series.

Carry-over insight: Acclerated growth phase (P21-P24): Demand has increased for four consecutive periods, establishing a new baseline above 2500 units. The 3-period moving average increased from 2059 to 2371 (+15%) in just three periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a strong and persistent upward trend. Since Period 21, the product has experienced five consecutive periods of growth (with one minor flat period at P21), moving from a level of ~1980 units to the current 2604 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P22-P25) show a sustained climb: 2221, 2326, 2566, and 2604. While the growth rate slowed slightly in the most recent period (+1.5% in P25 vs +10% in P24), the overall momentum remains firmly positive. Given the historical pattern of this SKU where 'plateaus' often lead to further surges, I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory into Period 26. I am forecasting a modest increase of approximately 3-4% over the P25 demand, targeting the 2700 unit range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth cycle (P21-P25): Demand has increased for five consecutive periods (effectively, as P21 was near-flat), shifting the baseline from ~2000 to >2600 units, representing a 30% increase in the current high-demand regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained growth cycle for over 25 periods. Specifically, since Period 21, demand has risen in five of the last six periods, shifting the baseline from ~1980 to ~2645. While the pace of growth has slowed slightly in the most recent two periods (1.5% and 1.6% in P25 and P26 respectively) compared to the 10% jump in P24, the trend remains consistently upward. The historical pattern suggests that 'stabilization' often precedes another leg of growth or a minor correction, but given the strong five-period upward momentum (P22-P26), a modest increase following the current trajectory is the most likely outcome. Forecast logic: Apply the recent ~1.5% growth rate to the latest demand value (2645 * 1.015) to account for the current stabilization/growth mix.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth cycle (P21-P26): Demand has increased for five consecutive periods (P22-P26), shifting the baseline from ~2000 to ~2645 units. Although the growth rate slowed to ~1.5% over the last two periods, the high-volume regime remains intact with no evidence of mean reversion yet.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and sustained upward trend. Period 27 saw a significant jump to 2,890 units (+9.3% from Period 26), following a brief period of slower growth (+1.5% and +1.6% in Periods 25 and 26). This jump breaks the minor plateau and suggests renewed growth momentum. The 3-period moving average has climbed from 2,371 to 2,713 over the last few cycles. Since the product is chips (Regular), a staple consumer snack, this pattern suggests either expanding market reach or a seasonal ramp-up that has not yet peaked. Given the trend of the last 6 periods (22-27), all of which showed increases, I will forecast a continued upward move, projecting a similar growth magnitude to the recent average (~4-5%).

Carry-over insight: Renewed growth acceleration (P27): After two periods of stabilization (~1.5% growth), demand surged by 9.3% in Period 27, establishing a new high-volume baseline approaching 2,900 units and confirming the expansion phase is still active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9408.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a consistent upward growth cycle for chips(Regular), characterized by multi-period expansion phases followed by brief 1-2 period corrections or plateaus (e.g., P10, P20, and now P28). Specifically, Period 28 saw a dip to 2643 units (-8.5% from P27), which mirrors previous structural dips in P10 and P20. In these previous instances, the 'dip' period acted as a mean reversion or a reset before demand resumed its upward trajectory. The demand in P28 (2643) essentially returned to the level established in P26 (2645), suggesting a temporary consolidation rather than a trend reversal. My forecast for P29 anticipates a rebound from this dip, consistent with the product's long-term hyper-growth pattern. I am projecting a recovery towards the 2800 range, which sits between the P28 floor and the P27 peak, following the logic of previous recovery cycles (like P11 or P22).

Carry-over insight: Recurring 'dip and surge' pattern: Period 28 identifies as a correction phase (-8.5%) similar to P10 and P20. Historically, these dips have preceded strong growth, with P11 rising 31% and P22 rising 12% after similar corrections. The high-volume regime remains intact with a support level around 2600-2650 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a long-term upward trajectory characterized by periodic corrections followed by rapid recoveries. Period 28 saw a significant dip (-8.5%) to 2643 units, which Period 29 partially recovered (+6.5%) to 2814 units. Historical 'dip and surge' patterns observed in Period 10 (corrected in P11) and Period 20 (corrected in P22) show that the recovery typically reaches or exceeds the previous peak within two periods. With Period 27 at 2890 and Period 29 at 2814, Period 30 is positioned for a return to the growth trend. The growth rate between P28 and P29 indicates strong momentum. I anticipate demand will continue to recover toward the previous high of ~2900, likely establishing a new baseline between 2950 and 3100 as per the established growth cycle.

Carry-over insight: Recovery phase confirmed: Period 29 demand (+6.5%) confirms the 'dip and surge' pattern identified in Period 28. Historical precedent (P11-P12 and P21-P23) suggests that following a correction, demand typically recovers to establish a new peak within 2-3 periods, maintaining the long-term high-growth regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' followed a structural 'dip and surge' pattern in recent periods. After a temporary correction in Period 28 (2643), demand recovered in Period 29 (2814) and continued to grow in Period 30 (2873). Historically (e.g., P10-P12 and P20-P23), such recoveries typically persist for 3-4 periods and eventually establish a new peak above the previous high (which was 2890 in P27). Given the current upward momentum of approximately 2% growth in the most recent period, I expect the next period to break the previous peak and establish a new high-volume baseline around the 2950-3000 unit range.

Carry-over insight: Post-correction recovery confirmed: After the Period 28 dip, demand has increased for two consecutive periods (P29-P30). This validates the 'dip and surge' behavior observed historically, where recovery phases lead to new peaks within 3-4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11450.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward growth regime characterized by periodic 'dip and surge' patterns. Period 31 demand (3046) represents a new all-time high, confirming the recovery from the Period 28 dip (2643). Historically, once a recovery phase breaks the previous peak (2890 in Period 27), demand typically continues to rise/stabilize at a higher level for 2-3 periods. Following the 6% increase in Period 31, I anticipate a moderate continuation of the growth trend. The growth rates in similar post-recovery phases (e.g., P11 to P12, P23 to P24) ranged from 4% to 10%. Splitting this difference, a ~5% increase from Period 31 is projected for Period 32.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume ceiling established: Period 31 (3046) confirms the breach of the 3000-unit threshold and validates the 'dip and surge' recovery pattern observed in previous historical cycles (P10/P11 and P20/P21).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term upward trend characterized by periodic 'dip and surge' cycles. Historically, after significant growth phases, the product experiences a minor correction (e.g., Period 10, 20, and 28) followed by a stabilization period before reaching new highs. The most recent sequence shows a dip in Period 28 (2643), followed by a recovery to a new peak in Period 31 (3046). Period 32 (3005) shows a slight cooling (-1.3%), which mirrors the stabilization patterns seen in Periods 12-14 and 25-26. Given the consistent historical pattern of demand settling briefly after crossing a major threshold (3000 units in this case), the forecast anticipates minor growth or consolidation. I will project a slight increase to maintain the underlying upward trajectory while accounting for the immediate short-term stabilization observed in Period 32.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation phase at 3000-unit baseline: Following the breach of the 3000-unit mark in Period 31, Period 32 shows initial signs of stabilization (-1.3%), consistent with previous regime shifts where demand plateaus for 2-3 periods before the next expansion.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established long-term upward trend, recently characterized by a 'dip and surge' pattern. Following a brief consolidation at the 3,000-unit mark in Period 32 (3,005), Period 33 saw a significant breakout to 3,391 units (+12.8%). This surge mirrors historical patterns (e.g., P11, P22, P29) where a correction or plateau is immediately followed by a new growth phase. Given that demand has increased by an average of approximately 5-10% during these expansion windows, and considering the momentum from Period 33, a continued rise is expected. However, following such a large single-period jump (+386 units), the growth rate often moderates slightly as it approaches a new temporary ceiling.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume regime confirmed in Period 33: A 12.8% surge broke the previous 3,000-unit ceiling, establishing a new baseline above 3,300 units and continuing the long-term upward trend.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trend, characterized by a 'step-and-plateau' growth pattern. Period 34 demand (3368) shows a very slight stabilization (-0.6%) after the significant surge in Period 33 (3391). This behavior mirrors previous cycles (e.g., Periods 12-14, 25-26, and 31-32), where a breakthrough to a new level is followed by a brief period of consolidation or minor oscillation before the next leg up. The 3-period moving average has shifted from 2975 (P30-P32) to 3255 (P32-P34), indicating a confirmed baseline shift of approximately 9.4%. Given the current consolidation at the 3350-3400 unit level and the historical tendency for growth to resume or stabilize briefly after a surge, I forecast Period 35 demand to remain near the current high established in Period 33, with a slight upward bias common in this product's expansion phases.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization phase confirmed at >3300 baseline: Following the Period 33 surge, demand has consolidated between 3360-3400 units, establishing the current high-demand floor similarly to the plateaus seen at 1250, 2000, and 2600 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a long-term upward trend characterized by periodic surges followed by brief stabilization/correction phases (the 'dip and surge' pattern). Recently, demand hit a new peak in Period 33 (3391 units) and has since undergone a minor correction over the last two periods (3368 in P34 and 3282 in P35, a -2.5% decrease). Historically, similar corrections (e.g., P20-P21, P28-P30, P31-P32) have lasted 1-3 periods before demand stabilizes or surges again. The current 3-period moving average (P33-P35) is 3347 units. Given the trend of finding a new floor after a breakout, P36 is likely to see demand stabilization or a slight recovery as it finds support above the previous 3000-unit ceiling. I expect demand to remain within the 3250-3350 range during this consolidation phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trend characterized by periodic surges followed by brief consolidation phases. Recently, demand established a new baseline above 3,300 units (P33-P34). Although Period 35 showed a minor dip (3,282), Period 36 recovered strongly with a 5% increase to 3,448 units, which is a new historical peak. Historically, after such a recovery from a minor dip (similar to P28-P29 or P31-P32), the next periods typically show continued momentum or stabilization at the new high level. Given the positive momentum in P36 (+166 units) and the consistent historical structural growth, I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory toward the 3,550-3,600 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volume regime (P33-P36): Demand has stabilized and then expanded within the 3,300-3,450 range, confirming a new baseline approximately 12% higher than the previous 3,000-unit plateau.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong long-term upward trend characterized by periodic 'step-ups' and brief consolidation phases. In Period 37, demand reached a new all-time high of 3,748 units, representing an 8.7% increase from Period 36. This follows the historical 'dip and surge' pattern where demand moves from a plateau (P33-P35 averaged ~3,350) into a new expansion phase. Comparing the recent 3-period moving average (P35-P37: 3,493) to the previous 3-period average (P32-P34: 3,255) shows a consistent 7.3% growth in the demand baseline. Given the momentum from the significant jump in Period 37, I expect a follow-through increase as the product establishes its presence in the 3,700-4,000 unit range.

Carry-over insight: New expansion phase confirmed in Period 37: Demand broke out of the 3,300-3,450 consolidation range with an 8.7% jump to 3,748 units, suggesting the start of a new growth cycle toward the 4,000-unit threshold.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14778.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong and consistent upward trend. Over the last two periods (P37 and P38), demand has surged from the 3,300-3,400 range to a new peak of 3,929. This follows the 'dip and surge' pattern identified in the carry-over insights (notably at P10, P20, and P28), where a correction or stabilization phase is followed by a strong expansion. In the current cycle, P37 saw an 8.7% increase and P38 saw a 4.8% increase. Given this momentum and the historical behavior of the product to reach and then slightly breach psychological thresholds (like 3,000 in P31 or 2,000 in P19), I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory toward or slightly beyond the 4,000-unit mark. A growth rate of approximately 4-5% from the current peak is consistent with recent transitions.

Carry-over insight: Sustained expansion phase (P37-P38): Demand has reached a new high-volume regime, increasing from ~3,400 to ~3,900 (+15%) in two periods, signaling the start of a growth cycle targeting the 4,000-unit threshold.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a recurring pattern of multi-period growth cycles followed by brief consolidations. Currently, the SKU is in a strong expansion phase, with demand increasing for four consecutive periods (P36-P39). The growth rates over the last three periods (8.7% in P37, 4.8% in P38, and 7.2% in P39) demonstrate accelerating momentum, successfully breaching the 4,000-unit threshold in Period 39. Given the average incremental increase of approximately 232 units over the last two periods and the lack of signals for a correction (which typically occur after a plateau or extreme volatility), the forecast anticipates continued growth. I will project a moderate increase adhering to the recent trend, positioning the next period demand around 4,450 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained expansion phase (P37-P39): Demand has increased for three consecutive periods, breaking the 4,000-unit threshold and shifting the 3-period moving average to 3,963 (+15.6% from the P34-P36 average).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong, sustained upward trend since Period 2. Most recently, Period 37 to Period 40 has seen a consecutive four-period growth streak (3748, 3929, 4212, 4461), breaking the 4,000-unit threshold. The average growth over the last three periods is approximately 237 units per period (+6.2%). Given that the most recent jump from Period 39 to 40 was 249 units (+5.9%), demand is currently in an acceleration phase. I expect this momentum to continue, though typically such steep growth eventually faces a minor correction or stabilization 'dip' (as seen in P10, P20, P28). However, without immediate evidence of a slowdown in the P40 data, the forecast follows the established expansion trend, projecting a similar absolute increase to maintain the current trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Expansion phase continues (P37-P40): Demand has increased for four consecutive periods, establishing a new high-volume regime above 4,400 units. The 3-period moving average has accelerated to 4200 units, representing a 11.5% increase over the previous 3-period block (P34-P36).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is characterized by a strong long-term upward trend punctuated by periodic 'dips' or consolidation phases (e.g., Period 10, 20, 28, 32). Period 41 shows a 6.6% decline from the peak in Period 40 (4461), which aligns with the historical 'dip and surge' pattern observed throughout the training data. In previous cycles, these corrections typically lasted 1-2 periods before demand rebounded to establish a new ceiling. Given the magnitude of the previous expansion phase (P36-P40, a ~29% increase), a minor correction is expected. Based on historical recovery behavior (such as Period 11, 22, and 29), I anticipate demand to stabilize or begin a slight recovery in Period 42 as it seeks a new baseline around the 4200-4400 range.

Carry-over insight: Post-expansion correction confirmed: Period 41 (-6.6%) follows the historical 'dip and surge' pattern observed in Periods 10, 20, and 28. This suggests a temporary cooling phase before the next potential growth cycle, with demand likely finding support above the 4100-unit level.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a correction phase following a peak of 4,461 in Period 40. Historical 'dip and surge' patterns (observed in Periods 10, 20, and 28) typically involve a 1-2 period decline followed by a stabilization or recovery phase. Periods 41 and 42 showed declines of 6.6% and 3.0% respectively. Based on the behavior after Period 20 (where demand stabilized for one period before surging) and Period 28 (where recovery began immediately), Period 43 is expected to find support around the 4,000-unit level and begin a slight recovery or stabilization. I am forecasting a modest rebound to 4,120, reflecting the start of the recovery phase seen in previous cycles.

Carry-over insight: Post-expansion correction phase extended: Demand has declined for two consecutive periods (P41-P42) after hitting the 4,400+ peak, settling into a support zone around 4,000-4,100 units, consistent with historical 'dip and surge' cycles.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a consistent long-term upward trend punctuated by periodic 'dip and surge' correction phases. Currently, the product is in its most extended correction phase to date, with three consecutive declines following the Period 40 peak of 4461 (P41: -6.6%, P42: -3.0%, P43: -2.2%). The magnitude of these declines is narrowing significantly, suggesting demand is approaching a local support floor. Historically, these dips (e.g., P10, P20, P28, and P34-35) typically last 1-3 periods before a recovery or new expansion phase begins. Given that the decline rate has decelerated to just 2.2% in Period 43 and the 4000-unit mark serves as a psychological and historical support level, I anticipate Period 44 will mark the end of the correction and the start of a recovery phase, consistent with the recurring pattern of establishing new baselines after transient pullbacks.

Carry-over insight: Post-expansion correction phase matured (P41-P43): The current three-period correction is the longest in the series, but the decelerating rate of decline (-6.6% to -2.2%) indicates stabilization near the 3950-4000 unit support level, suggesting a transition to a new growth or plateau phase is imminent.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow its established 'dip and surge' pattern. Following a technical correction between Periods 41 and 43 where demand bottomed out at 3,950 units, Period 44 showed a significant recovery of +12.5% to 4,444 units. This recovery mirrors previous cycles (e.g., Periods 11, 22, and 29) where a sharp rebound follows a 1-3 period decline. Historically, these recovery surges often lead to a new peak or a stabilization at higher levels within 1-2 periods. Given that Period 44 has almost reclaimed the previous high of 4,461, I anticipate Period 45 will continue this momentum to establish a new peak, consistent with the long-term upward trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Recovery phase confirmed: Period 44 surge (+12.5%) validates the completion of the post-expansion correction (P41-P43) and signals the start of a new growth leg, consistent with historical 'dip and surge' behavior observed at Periods 11, 22, and 29.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by periodic 'dip and surge' cycles. Following the most recent correction phase (P41-P43), demand surged in P44 to 4,444 units and softened slightly in P45 to 4,364 units (-1.8%). This pattern of a sharp recovery followed by a brief period of consolidation is consistent with previous regime shifts, specifically the post-surge plateaus observed at P12-P14 and P33-P35. Given that demand has failed to significantly exceed the P40 peak (4,461) in the current cycle, I anticipate demand will remain in a consolidation phase near the current high-volume baseline of ~4,400 units, likely showing modest growth or stability as it builds momentum for the next expansion phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17047.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of chips(Regular) demand reveals a consistent 'dip and surge' pattern, where multi-period corrections (e.g., P41-P43) are followed by a recovery that establishes new all-time highs. Period 46 (4530 units) successfully broke the previous peak of 4461 units (P40), confirming that the demand regime has successfully moved past the correction phase and is entering a new expansion leg. Given the 3.8% growth in the most recent period and the historical behavior following a peak break, I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory as it builds a new ceiling. Applying a conservative growth estimate to the current peak to account for the sustained upward momentum observed throughout the 46-period history.

Carry-over insight: New high-volume peak confirmed: Period 46 (4530) has surpassed the previous P40 peak (4461), successfully completing the recovery from the P41-P43 correction and signaling the start of a new expansion phase above the 4500-unit mark.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17075.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, following a completed 'dip and surge' cycle (P41-P43 correction followed by a P44-P47 recovery). Demand has risen for two consecutive periods (P46-P47) and has surpassed the previous peak of 4461 units (P40), establishing a new high-volume baseline above 4500 units. Historically, recovery phases in this data series lead to sustained growth streaks of 3-5 periods before the next stabilization or correction. Given the current momentum (+3.8% in P46 and +1.4% in P47) and the pattern of reaching successive new highs during expansion legs, I expect demand to continue increasing toward the 4700-4800 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained expansion phase (P44-P47): After the P41-P43 correction, demand has established a three-period upward trajectory (excluding the minor P45 consolidation), shifting the baseline from ~4000 to >4500 units (+12.5% shift).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, following the 'dip and surge' pattern identified in previous periods. After a correction phase that ended in Period 43 (3950 units), demand has entered a new expansion leg, increasing in four of the last five periods (P44-P48). Specifically, Period 48 saw a robust 3.9% increase (+181 units) to 4776, marking a new all-time high. The 3-period moving average has shifted from 4286 (P43-P45) to 4633 (P46-P48), a 8.1% increase in the immediate baseline. Given the current momentum and historical expansion cycles which typically last 5-7 periods before a major plateau, I expect demand to continue rising toward the 5000-unit threshold.

Carry-over insight: Expansion phase confirmed (P44-P48): Following the P41-P43 correction, demand has established a clear upward trend, shifting the baseline from ~4000 to ~4775 units (+19% total recovery), with the most recent growth accelerating from 1.4% to 3.9%.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, characterized by a 'dip and surge' pattern. Following the correction phase in Periods 41-43, demand has entered a sustained growth cycle, increasing for four consecutive periods (P46-P49). The growth rate has notably accelerated in the last two periods, increasing from 3.9% in Period 48 to 6.5% in Period 49, breaking the 5,000-unit threshold. Historically, such expansion phases last between 3 and 7 periods before a plateau or correction. Given the current momentum and the 3-period moving average of 4819 units, the forecast anticipates a continuation of this growth leg. Applying a growth rate slightly dampened from the most recent peak to account for typical deceleration yields a prediction in the 5250-5400 range.

Carry-over insight: New expansion phase confirmed (P44-P49): Demand has increased for four consecutive periods and broken the 5,000-unit threshold, shifting the baseline from ~4500 to ~5100 units.
