The OR recommendation of 3,409 units is significantly understated because it is still anchored to early periods when demand was as low as ~100 units. Since the actual lead time is 0 periods, the order arrives within the same period. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 48. Given the slight upward pressure in recent demand (reaching 4,595 in P47), I will order 4,600 units.
