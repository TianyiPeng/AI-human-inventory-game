This calculation is based on the critical fractile (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1) = 0.8), targeting an 80% service level. Given that this is the first period and we must satisfy current demand immediately to avoid stockouts, the OR recommendation of 127 units (which includes a safety stock buffer of roughly 15-16 units over the mean) is a sound starting point.

To prevent further lost sales while managing holding costs, I will move closer to the uncapped requirement.

The OR recommendation of 3,334 units remains significantly lower than the actual demand regime because it factors in historical data from early in the game when demand was much lower. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by the 'Period 46 conclude' message. To maximize total reward, I need to cover the expected demand for the current period while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 6 units. Considering the high-end of the recent stabilized range (approx. 4,550 units), I will order 4,550 units to minimize the risk of a stockout without incurring excessive holding costs, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) favors high service levels.",

The 3-period average is approximately 4,500 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The supplier-promised lead time is 0 periods, which is consistently observed in historical data (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). The OR recommendation of 3,409 units is significantly lower than the current demand regime because the OR algorithm treats all historical demand (starting from 91 units) equally and does not adjust for the massive upward trend. At a profit of $4.00 and a holding cost of $1.00, the critical fractile is 0.8, justifying a stock level that covers expected demand plus a safety margin. Since we are in the final periods of the simulation (P48 of 50), it is crucial to maximize sales by meeting the current demand level of ~4,600 units.

The most recent demand (P49) reached a new all-time high of 5,087 units, which is significantly higher than the OR recommendation of 3,566 units. The OR baseline is failing to adapt to this rapid growth because it weights all historical samples (including the low-demand early periods) equally. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 50) to avoid stockouts. Based on the 10-period trend, demand has increased by approximately 200-300 units per period recently (P47: 4,595; P48: 4,776; P49: 5,087). Projecting this trend, I estimate Period 50 demand will fall between 5,200 and 5,400 units. I will order 5,400 units to ensure service levels are maintained during this peak growth phase.
