  "rationale": "In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], yielding an empirical mean of approximately 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to meet demand within this same period. The Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, resulting in a critical fractile of 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which maps to a safety factor (z*) of approximately 0.84. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 127 units. Given that this is a regular snack item with relatively stable historical demand and no current calendar or product-specific events to suggest a spike, the OR recommendation provides a solid baseline for a 0-lead-time environment.

The OR recommendation of 3,133 units is significantly underestimating the current regime because it relies on the entire historical dataset, which includes much lower demand periods from the start of the game.
