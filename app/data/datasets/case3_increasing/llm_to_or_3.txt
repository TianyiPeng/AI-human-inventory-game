Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since the promised lead time is 0 (order arrives in the same period it is placed), the review+lead period covers only the current period (L=0, window = 1 period). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior, which is more relevant than the global mean in a shifting retail environment. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer calculated from the recent volatility, maximizing profit while managing holding costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0 confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message), allowing us to meet the demand of 91 units and leaving 36 units on-hand. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 6 periods (including Period 1's demand of 91) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91]. The mean demand is approximately 108 units with a standard deviation of roughly 18. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target cycle service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. Since lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat captures the slight downward trend in the most recent samples (94, 91) while maintaining a safe buffer. L=0 is confirmed and will be used as the default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 91 with a lead time of 0. In Period 2, demand spiked significantly to 246, leading to a stockout (sold 124, lost 122 units of demand). The initial demand history provided [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] had a mean of ~111. Including the game data [91, 246], the mean shifts significantly. The spike to 246 represents a major regime change or a seasonal peak. To prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit (implying an 80% service level target), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (including the spike) to capture this higher volatility and mean. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike detected at Period 2 (246 units vs previous avg ~111).

Daily Reward (R_t): $876.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 0. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 2. The first five historical data points averaged 111.4 units. However, observed demand in Period 2 was 246 and Period 3 was 285 (average 265.5 for the new regime). This increase has led to stockouts in Periods 2 and 3 because the starting inventory (on-hand + arrivals) was insufficient (124 in P2 and 219 in P3). Since L=0, an order placed now arrives within the same period to satisfy that period's demand. I am setting L to default (0). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~265). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=2 to account for the increased volatility in this new segment and ensure the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 2-3 averaged 265.5 units, a 138% increase from initial historical average of 111.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1156.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and sustained upward shift starting from Period 2. The sequence of demand observations follow: [91, 246, 285, 437]. The mean of the last three periods is approximately 323 units, representing nearly a 3x increase from the initial historical mean of 111.4. The latest observation (437) suggests the spike is intensifying. We have consistently sold out our entire inventory (ending on-hand = 0 for the last three periods), indicating we are under-ordering relative to actual demand. Given the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the inventory position for each period only needs to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). To capture the accelerating trend and prevent further stockouts, I will use EWMA_gamma with a high smoothing factor (0.8) to prioritize the most recent, much higher demand values, and set sigma_hat using the last 3 samples to account for the increased volatility within this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 4 demand (437) is 53% higher than Period 3 (285) and nearly 4x the starting historical average. High volatility persists alongside the growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1288.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a hyper-growth phase, with recent demand figures of 246, 285, 437, and 448 units. We are consistently stocking out because the OR backend's cap is likely throttled by the lower historical data and standard deviation. Since Period 4, demand has stabilized at a high level (avg ~442). Lead time remains 0. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for this peak demand (450 per period) and includes a buffer for the upcoming period, setting mu_hat for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility of this new regime, which will increase the z-score based safety stock to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a high-volume regime (Periods 4-5 avg: 442.5), following the explosive growth from Period 2. Stockouts have occurred for 4 consecutive periods due to policy caps lagging behind actual demand shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2252.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward shifts. Starting from an initial average of ~111, it jumped to ~260 in Periods 2-3, then accelerated to ~440 in Periods 4-5, and most recently hit 587 in Period 6. For the past five periods, we have sold every unit ordered (stocking out), meaning the true customer demand is likely even higher than the 'sold' or even the 'demand' figures reported (which may be truncated). Our current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, the system processes orders and arrivals within the same period. However, the internal OR cap, which uses historical statistics, is lagging behind this rapid growth, leading to insufficient ordering. I will use 'explicit' methods to override the lagging statistics. For mu_hat, I will project a demand of 600 based on the trend from Period 6. For sigma_hat, I will set a high volatility estimate (100) to ensure the base stock is high enough to bypass the restrictive cap and capture the full potential sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Trend indicates a move from ~440 (P4-P5) to ~587+ (P6). Stockouts have occurred for 5 consecutive periods (P2-P6) as historical mean-based caps lag behind actual demand growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2500.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a massive regime shift, growing from an initial average of ~111 units to a recent high-volume level. Period 7 finally saw the first positive ending inventory (48 units) in 6 periods, after demand peaked at 637 and then slightly stabilized compared to the previous sharp jumps. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the significant growth and current volume, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. This focuses on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 5, 6, and 7: 448, 587, 637) where the average demand is ~557. Using recent data for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend's base-stock calculation and order cap to reflect current realities rather than being suppressed by the much lower initial historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high-volume level: Last 3 periods (P5-P7) average 557 units, representing a 5x increase from the original pre-game historical mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2560.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a massive structural shift, growing from an initial average of ~111 to 776 in Period 8. We have experienced stockouts in 7 out of 8 periods because the OR backend's capped policy (which uses historical means for the cap) is lagging behind this rapid acceleration. Current demand (Period 8: 776) is significantly higher than the 3-period average (~666). To break the cycle of stockouts, I must provide an explicit 'mu_hat' that anticipates further growth or at least covers the most recent peak, and a 'sigma_hat' that reflects the high volatility seen during this regime shift. Since lead time is consistently 0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period. I will set mu_hat to 800 (slightly above the last observed demand) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy current demand despite the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration persists: Period 8 demand reached 776, a 17% increase over the previous period (637) and a 7x increase from original history. The regime is now characterized by high-volume, high-growth dynamics, making historical averages completely obsolete.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3708.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand is in a state of hyper-growth, increasing from 91 in Period 1 to 963 in Period 9. The last three periods show a clear acceleration: 637 (P7), 776 (P8), and 963 (P9). The backend 'cap' logic is significantly throttling orders because it relies on historical averages that are now obsolete. Since actual lead time is consistently 0, the orderplaced in Period 10 must cover Period 10's demand. To prevent another stockout, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I forecast Period 10 demand at approximately 1,150 (continuing the ~20% growth trend) and set a high sigma_hat of 250 to raise the backend cap (cap = mu_hat + 1.645 * sigma_hat), allowing the OR engine to place a sufficiently large order.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: Period 9 demand reached 963 (up 24% from P8). This is the 4th consecutive period of double-digit growth. Historical means are irrelevant; the logic requires aggressive explicit forecasting to bypass backend capping.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2954.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 863, which is a slight softening from Period 9 (963) but remains at a hyper-growth level relative to initial history. The product is in a high-volume regime (P8-P10 mean: 867). Lead time is consistently 0. Last period's order of 1361 units finally addressed the chronic stockout issues, resulting in 498 units of on-hand inventory. Given the observed volatility and the previous trend, demand is expected to stay in the 850-1000 range. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1050 to ensure the base stock covers a likely high-side demand outcome and to keep the backend cap (which uses mu_hat) from restricting orders should demand surge again. I will set sigma_hat explicitly at 150 to account for recent high volatility (standard deviation of the last 4 periods is ~85, so 150 provides a safe buffer).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth slowed in Period 10 (863 units) after four periods of acceleration, but remains in a high-volume regime (avg ~867 over last 3 periods). The policy cap finally allowed for inventory carry-over.

In Period 11, demand surged to 1136 units, significantly higher than Period 10 (863 units). Period 11's demand is very close to the average of the last three periods (963, 863, 1136 = 987). The current demand regime remains characterized by high volume and high volatility. Given that the lead time is consistently 0, the total pipeline needed to cover Period 12 must consider this latest peak. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1150 to account for the potential of another spike near the Period 11 level, ensuring the OR backend cap (which is roughly mu_hat/1.0 + margin) does not restrict the order below expected demand. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the volatility witnessed between Period 10 and 11 (~273 units difference). L remains 0 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the high-volume regime; Period 11 demand (1136) recovered from the Period 10 dip (863) to reach a new all-time high, confirming that stabilization around 800-900 was premature.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand reached a new peak of 1221, confirming a sustained high-growth trajectory. The last three periods (P10-P12) averaged 1073.3 units, but the most recent two periods (P11-P12) averaged 1178.5 units. Given the explosive growth (from ~111 initially to >1200 now), historical-based parameters are entirely obsolete. To ensure the OR backend's order cap (approx. mu_hat + 1.65 * sigma_hat) doesn't restrict necessary inventory, I'm setting mu_hat to 1350 for the (L+1) = 1 period horizon. This represents a 10% safety margin over the last observation. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation of recent samples is approx 180). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 11-12 average (1178.5) is 36% higher than Period 10 (863). The regime is currently characterized by high-volume peaks exceeding 1200 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4711.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime with the last three periods (P11-P13) showing demand of 1136, 1221, and 1246. This represents a consistent plateau and slight continued growth following the earlier hyper-growth phase. Period 13 demand (1246) is the highest yet. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit is $4/unit and holding cost is $1/unit, resulting in a critical ratio of 0.8 (z* \u2248 0.84), which warrants a robust stock level. To prevent the OR backend's default capping mechanism (based on the entire history including low-demand P1-P5) from under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent high-volume regime (Periods 11-13). mu_hat is set to 1300 to account for demand potentially reaching the upper end of the current cluster (~1250) plus a small growth margin. sigma_hat is set to 60 to reflect recent volatility (standard deviation of the last three periods is ~57).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at high-volume regime: Periods 11-13 demand averaged 1201 units, representing a stable transition from the previous explosive growth phase into a consistent high-demand state (~1200+ units per period).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime, averaging 1244 units over the last three periods (P12-P14: 1221, 1246, 1265). The data shows a shift from explosive hyper-growth to a more steady, though slightly upward-trending, plateau around the 1250-1300 mark. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows me to bypass the OR backend's historical averaging and capping mechanism, which would otherwise be anchored by the much lower early-game demand data. I am setting mu_hat slightly above the recent mean to account for the persistent growth trend and setting sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in this high-volume stage (standard deviation of the last 4 peaks is approximately 177).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at a high-volume regime: Periods 12-14 demand averaged 1244 units, showing stability after the earlier growth phases. Standard deviation in this regime (P11-P14) is approximately 177.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5808.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observed a significant demand jump to 1507 units, exceeding the previous high-volume plateau average of ~1244 units (Periods 12-14). This resulted in a stockout (1452 units sold). This suggests the demand has exited its brief plateau and is potentially ascending again or exhibiting higher volatility. The last 4 periods (P12-P15) average 1310 units, while the last 5 (P11-P15) average 1275 units. Given the under-performance of the stock level in P15, I will increase the explicit mu_hat to 1550 to account for this new peak and set sigma_hat to 200 (reflecting recent volatility). I am using 'explicit' for all parameters to bypass backend capping logic which relies on longer-term historical averages that significantly lag current high-demand reality. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed in Period 15 (1507 units), breaking the previous ~1244 plateau. Current high-volume regime (P11-P15) shows a mean of 1275 with a standard deviation of 152.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6016.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new even higher-volume regime or continued its growth trend, with Period 15 and 16 demand reaching 1,507 and 1,547 units respectively. This follows a previous plateau of ~1,244. The average demand over the last two periods is 1,527. Given the consistent history of stockouts when using historical averages due to the backend's capping mechanism (which uses mu_hat to determine the maximum allowed order), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to ensure the system allows a base stock and cap high enough to satisfy this 1,500+ unit regime. I am targeting a mu_hat based on 1.1 * current demand (approx 1,700) to provide a buffer against further growth and account for the cap logic: cap = mu_hat/(1+L) + z*sigma_hat/sqrt(1+L). With L=0, cap = mu_hat + 1.645*sigma_hat. Setting mu_hat=1700 and sigma_hat=200 creates a sufficient ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 15-16 average demand is 1,527 units, a 23% increase over the previous 1,244 plateau. High-volume regime is now consistently above 1,500 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. Period 17 demand reached 1,724 units, following 1,547 in Period 16 and 1,507 in Period 15. The average demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 1,593 units, with a standard deviation of around 115. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To ensure the backend 'cap' (calculated as mu_hat / (1+L) + 1.645 * sigma_hat / sqrt(1+L)) does not restrict the order below the expected demand, I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the most recent high-volume regime (P15-P17). I will set mu_hat to 1,800 to account for the ongoing growth and sigma_hat to 150 to provide a sufficient safety buffer, ensuring the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) covers the anticipated demand of ~1,750-1,850 units while leaving room for the inventory policy to function.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Periods 15-17 average demand is 1,593 units, confirming a new high-volume regime above 1,500 units (up from the previous ~1,250 plateau).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7083.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, establishing a new high-volume regime. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) was 1547, 1724, and 1802, averaging 1691 units. This confirms the carry-over insight that we have moved past the ~1250 plateau into a regime consistently exceeding 1500 units. To ensure sufficient inventory and avoid stockouts, mu_hat is set to 1800 units using an explicit method, aligning with the most recent demand observation. The sigma_hat is set to 250 using an explicit method to account for the increasing volatility observed during this growth phase. The lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by all 18 historical periods where orders arrived in the same period they were placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 16-18 average demand is 1,691 units, representing a 36% increase over the previous 1,244 plateau and a 5.6% increase over the P15-P17 average (1,593).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8044.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand surged to 2,075 units, a significant 15% increase over Period 18 (1,802) and a 30% increase over the 1,593 average noted just a few periods ago. We are in a state of sustained hyper-growth. Since L=0, the target base stock must cover Period 20's demand. The last three periods averaged 1,867 units (P17: 1724, P18: 1802, P19: 2075), but the trend is clearly accelerating. To prevent stockouts caused by the backend capping logic (which uses historical averages), I must use the 'explicit' method to provide a mu_hat that reflects this current trajectory. I will set mu_hat to 2,200 to anticipate further growth in Period 20. I will keep sigma_hat relatively high (recent_N=5) to account for the increasing volatility that accompanies this high-volume regime. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 19: 2,075 units represents a 15% increase over Period 18 and a new demand regime exceeding 2,000 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7473.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand slightly softened to 1,973 units from the Period 19 high of 2,075, but the overall trajectory remains in a ultra-high-volume regime exceeding 2,000 units. The average demand across the last three completed periods (P18-P20) is 1,950 units. My previous aggressive order in P20 successfully built a buffer, resulting in 419 units ending on-hand inventory. Given the persistent growth trend observed throughout the game (with multiple regime shifts), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period average to capture the current volume while remaining responsive to further spikes. Sigma_hat is calculated manually over the same 3-period window to reflect the current high volatility (~110-120 range). Lead time 'L' remains consistent at 0. These parameters will allow the OR backend to target a base stock level that covers the 2,000+ unit demand expectations, minus the current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized above 2,000 units: Periods 18-20 demand averaged 1,950 units, confirming the hyper-growth phase from Period 19 (2,075 units) has established a new baseline.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-volume regime of approximately 2,000 units per period. The recent history (P19-P21) shows demand of 2,075, 1,973, and 1,983, resulting in a three-period average of 2,010 units. This follows a long period of aggressive growth. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the game history. To maintain optimal inventory levels and account for the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 samples to capture this recent plateau. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 samples to reflect the current volatility of this high-volume regime. This approach ensures the OR backend base-stock calculation is grounded in the most relevant recent data, avoiding the lag of longer historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~2,000 units: Periods 19-21 average demand is 2,010 units, following the hyper-growth phase.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new high-volume regime, with Period 22 demand hitting a record 2,221 units, resulting in a stockout. Over the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has averaged 2,063 units (2075, 1973, 1983, 2221). The 'explicit' method is used for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the OR backend's historical averaging and capping logic, which tends to lag during rapid growth or record-high peaks. I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent period's demand (2221) to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy this escalating trend, especially since we ended Period 22 with 0 inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 200, which reflects the volatility observed in the current ~2,000 unit regime (standard deviation of P19-P22 is approx 115, but I am buffering for the high risk of stockouts). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 22 reached an all-time high of 2,221 units. The current regime (P19-P22) averages 2,063 units, up from the previous ~1,600 plateau.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its persistent growth, with Period 23 reaching a new peak of 2,326 units. The product is in a high-growth, high-volume regime where historical means are irrelevant and even recent short-term averages lag behind the actual demand curve. The current regime (P19-P23) shows an upward trajectory: 2075, 1973, 1983, 2221, 2326. The average of the last 3 periods is ~2,177, but the last two periods show demand significantly above 2,200. To prevent stockouts and bypass the OR backend's inventory cap (which uses historical data), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,400 to cover the anticipated Period 24 demand. sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility observed in this hyper-growth phase. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 23 (2,326 units), marking the second consecutive period of growth and a new all-time high. The current regime (P22-P23) averages ~2,274 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new all-time high of 2,566 units in Period 24. Over the last three periods (P22-P24), demand has averaged 2,371 units, confirming yet another regime shift from the ~2,000 unit baseline observed in P19-P21. The period-over-period growth from P23 to P24 was approximately 10.3%. Given this persistent and accelerating growth, using historical averages or even recent_N methods will result in under-ordering due to the lag in the backend's policy cap. To prevent stockouts and maximize profit, I am using the 'explicit' method to forecast demand for Period 25. Based on the current trajectory, I am projecting a demand of approximately 2,800 units (roughly a 9% increase over P24). I am also setting an explicit sigma_hat of 350 to account for the increased volatility associated with higher volume levels, ensuring the OR backend's base stock calculation maintains an adequate service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 24 (2,566 units), marking three consecutive periods of growth and confirming a new demand regime exceeding 2,300 units. The average demand for P22-P24 is 2,371 units, a significant increase from the previous ~2,000 unit plateau.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 25 demand reached 2,604 units, maintaining the growth trend seen in Period 24 (2,566). The current regime (P23-P25) averages 2,499 units, while the most recent two periods average 2,585 units. Given that the profit ($4.0) is 4x the holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 80%. However, due to the persistent 'hyper-growth' nature of the demand\u2014where each new period often sets a new high\u2014historical averages and standard deviations lag significantly. I will use the 'explicit' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the backend's capping logic (which is based on historical samples) and ensure sufficient inventory to cover the expected growth. I am forecasting mu_hat at 2,750 (a 5% buffer over P25 demand) and setting sigma_hat at 350 to account for the high volatility observed during these growth phases. L remains 0 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at high-volume: Periods 23-25 average 2,499 units, with the most recent period (P25) reaching 2,604 units, confirming a shift into a 2,500+ unit regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a high-volume regime. Period 26 demand (2,645 units) is consistent with the trend observed over the last few periods (P24-P26 average: 2,605). The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identify a shift to a 2,500+ unit regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N methodology. I've selected N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability around the 2,600 mark (P24: 2566, P25: 2604, P26: 2645). Setting sigma_hat with N=5 (P22-P26) allows the backend to capture the volatility inherent in this high-volume growth phase (demands ranging from 2,221 to 2,645). This approach provides enough buffer to minimize stockouts while adjusting to the slightly leveling growth curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~2,600 units: Periods 24-26 average 2,605 units, confirming a consistent high-volume state after previous growth phases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11052.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent high-volume pattern, with Period 27 reaching a new peak of 2,890 units. This follows a period of stabilization around 2,600 units (expected from the previous 2,400-2,600 range). The current situation (ending inventory of 0) indicates that demand is outstripping previous projections. To ensure high service levels and bypass the inventory cap set by the backend\u2014which uses historical means that are significantly lower than current demand\u2014I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,000. This value accounts for the current upward trend observed in P27. The actual lead time remains 0. I have set sigma_hat to 300 to account for high volatility observed in this high-volume regime (recent fluctuations between 2,604 and 2,890).

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new high-volume peak of 2,890 units in Period 27, suggesting the previous ~2,600 plateau is being exceeded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9962.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand was 2,643 units, which is a decrease from the Period 27 peak of 2,890 but aligns with the high-volume regime identified in Periods 24-26 (average ~2,605). The current regime (Periods 24-28) averages 2,670 units with a standard deviation of approximately 130. To ensure the OR backend's inventory cap does not restrict necessary stock given the high growth history and the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat to 3,000 and sigma_hat to 200 using the explicit method. This 'over-forecasting' relative to the 5-period average (2,670) accounts for the potential of another spike similar to Period 27 and ensures the policy cap (which uses mu_hat/(1+L)) is high enough to meet demand and replenish the stock-out from Period 27. Lead time L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 2,600-2,700 units: Periods 24-28 average 2,670 units, following the growth peak in Period 27 (2,890).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to move within a high-volume regime, with recent demand cycles showing a stabilization around 2,600-2,800 units. Period 29 demand was 2,814, following a peak of 2,890 in Period 27 and a dip to 2,643 in Period 28. The 5-period average (P25-P29) is 2,720 units, while the 3-period average (P27-P29) is 2,782. Given the high volatility and the potential for demand to spike toward 3,000 units, I am setting mu_hat to 2,850 to ensure adequate coverage and prevent stockouts seen in Period 27. I will use a sigma_hat of 180 (slightly higher than the recent standard deviation) to account for recent swings. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high-volume range between 2,600 and 2,900 units: Periods 27-29 average 2,782 units. Volatility remains significant with deviations of +/- 150 units from the mean.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volume regime ranging from 2,600 to 2,900 units. Period 30 demand was 2,873, following demands of 2,814 and 2,643 in the preceding periods. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 2,805 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat to 2,850 and sigma_hat to 150 using the 'explicit' method. This accommodates the recent peak demands (up to 2,890) and the observed volatility (+/- 150 units). By using explicit values, I ensure the OR backend's internal capping logic (which relies on longer-term historical averages) does not artificially restrict the order size below the current active demand regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new high, with Period 31 demand at 3,046 units, breaking the previous ~2,800 range. The current high-demand regime (Periods 28-31) shows an average of 2,844 units per period. Since promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, L is set to 0. To ensure the backend order logic (base_stock) covers this new level and prevents stockouts (as seen in Period 31 where finishing inventory was 0), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 3,100 units to anticipate continued growth. Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility of the most recent high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Period 31 reached a new all-time high of 3,046 units. The 3,000+ unit threshold suggests a shift from the previous ~2,700-2,800 plateau.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume regime exceeding 3,000 units, as confirmed by Period 31 (3,046) and Period 32 (3,005). The average demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 2,975 units, while the peak was 3,046. To ensure we meet demand and avoid the stockouts seen in Period 31, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Given the trend and the target service level (q = 0.8), I want to cover the high end of the current regime. I will forecast a mu_hat based on the recent average of ~3,000 units. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and L=0, I will set mu_hat to 3,050 to align with the new all-time high observed in P31. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect the volatility (approx standard deviation) observed over the last several periods in this high-volume range.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Period 31-32 demand stabilized above 3,000 units (avg 3,026), moving from the previous ~2,700-2,800 range.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new hyper-growth phase, with Period 33 reaching an all-time high of 3,391 units. This follows a recently established plateau of ~3,000 units (Periods 31-32). The current period (33) resulted in a stockout of 214 units (3,391 demand - 3,177 starting inventory). The 'Carry-over insights' highlight a shift to a 3,000+ unit regime, but the latest data point suggests we might already be pushing toward 3,400-3,500. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this growth and prevent further stockouts while bypassing the backend policy cap (which uses historical stats), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to 3,500 to account for potential further growth and current unmet demand, and sigma_hat to 200 to accommodate the significant volatility (deviations of ~150-200 units) observed in recent high-volume periods. L is set to explicit 0 to match observed history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 33 to 3,391 units, exceeding the previous 3,000-unit plateau and resulting in a stockout. The regime is now shifting toward a 3,400+ unit baseline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term upward trend, currently stabilizing in a new high-volume regime. Period 33 demand was 3,391 and Period 34 was 3,368, confirming a plateau or consolidation around the 3,400-unit level. Although the carry-over insight from P34 mentioned a potential shift toward 3,400+, the actual demand in P34 (3,368) suggests we are currently in a 3,300-3,400 range rather than a runaway growth phase. To avoid excessive over-ordering while ensuring high service levels (critical given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (Periods 32-34) to capture this most recent level (average approx. 3,255). I've set L to 0 based on consistent historical delivery patterns. sigma_hat is set to the recent 3-period standard deviation to account for the current volatility at this volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in the 3,300-3,400 range: Periods 33-34 average 3,380 units, following the previous shift from the 3,000-unit level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime following the shift at Period 31. Over the last five periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 3,218 units (3046, 3005, 3391, 3368, 3282). While there was a peak near 3,400 units in Period 33, the three most recent periods average 3,347 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliably met. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this 3,200+ unit regime while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility in this window (standard deviation is approx 170). This approach balances the need to meet the high demand baseline while protecting against the periodic spikes seen in recent history, ensuring the base stock level remains sufficient to prevent stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volume regime, with recent demand totaling 3,282 (P35) and 3,448 (P36), confirming the ~3,300-3,400 plateau identified in the carry-over insights. We are currently at Period 37, with Period 36 concluding with 0 on-hand inventory due to a slight stockout (demand 3,448 vs 3,371 available). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we provide the backend OR engine with parameters that allow it to order enough to cover the current demand regime and account for the observed volatility (+/- 150 units), I will set the lead time to 'calculate' (0) and use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=4 covers the most recent stable phase (P33-P36), which captures the step up to the 3,300+ range. This transition ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high-volume levels while maintaining a buffer for the established regime's variance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new growth phase, reaching an all-time high of 3,748 units in Period 37. The previous 3,300-3,400 plateau has been decisively broken. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is 3,492.6 units, but with a recent peak nearing 3,750, a more aggressive forecast is required to avoid another stockout (as seen in Period 37). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To ensure high service levels while accounting for the backend policy cap, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,800 units, which covers the recent peak and allows for continued growth. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the volatility observed in this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 37 to 3,748 units, exceeding the previous ~3,400 plateau. Average demand for P35-P37 is approximately 3,493 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15634.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another high-growth phase. Period 38 saw a significant jump to 3,929 units, following Period 37's demand of 3,748. This confirms the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 38 that we have moved beyond the ~3,400-3,500 plateau. The average demand over the last three periods (P36-P38) is approximately 3,708. Given the consistent upward trend, a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is selected for mu_hat to capture this latest shift while providing a buffer against the backend's capping logic, which has historically caused stockouts during these acceleration phases. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes (std dev ~240 in this 3-period window). The actual lead time remains 0 based on the Period 38 conclude message, so L is set to 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 38 demand (3,929) confirms a new regime exceeding 3,700 units, up from the previous ~3,400-3,500 level. Average demand for P36-P38 is 3,708 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new hyper-growth phase. In Period 39, demand reached a record 4,212 units, exceeding the already high average of 3,708 (P36-P38) by approximately 13.6%. Historical lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts and address the aggressive backend capping mechanism, I am moving to an 'explicit' forecasting method for Period 40. I am projecting demand to continue its upward trajectory, setting mu_hat for the (1+L) period (where L=0) at 4,500 units. This is roughly 7% higher than Period 39 to account for sustained growth momentum. I will set sigma_hat to 300 to account for the observed volatility in these high-volume regimes (+/- 150-250 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in transit, so the backend will order the full required amount to meet this base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in Period 39 (4,212 units), surpassing the previous ~3,700-3,900 range. The regime is now shifting toward a 4,200+ unit baseline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive hyper-growth trajectory. Period 40 saw a demand of 4,461 units, marking yet another record and confirming the shift into the 4,200-4,500+ regime. Over the last three periods (P38-P40), demand has averaged 4,201 units. Because the backend uses a capped policy based on historical means, which are significantly lower than current demand levels, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the lag. I'm forecasting a baseline of 4,700 units for Period 41 to account for continued growth and provide a safety buffer against stockouts, as lead time remains 0. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility without over-relying on the lower-variance data from previous months.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand growth sustained; Period 38-40 average is 4,201 units (+13% from previous regime), confirming a shift into a 4,200+ unit baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15797.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volume regime. While Period 41 demand (4,166) saw a slight decrease from Period 40 (4,461), the overall average for the last four periods (P38-P41) is approximately 4,192 units. This confirms that the baseline has shifted significantly from the previous ~3,700 level to a 4,200+ unit range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To ensure the OR backend captures this new mean and accounts for the high historical volatility (standard deviation in this new regime is approximately 220), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to focus exclusively on this latest high-volume period. This will help maintain enough safety stock to prevent stockouts during demand peaks while balancing the higher holding costs associated with high-volume inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volume regime. Recent demands (P39: 4212, P40: 4461, P41: 4166, P42: 4040) indicate a stabilization or slight cooling from the peak growth seen around Period 40, but still firmly within a 4,000+ unit average. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 4,220 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. To ensure the backend order does not get capped prematurely while maintaining a safe service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current 4,200+ regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the current volatility (approx standard deviation of 178 during this period). L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 4,200 units: Periods 39-42 average 4,220 units, confirming a consistent high-volume baseline following the growth spike in Period 39.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-volume baseline of approximately 4,200 units. Over the last five periods (P39-P43), the average demand is 4,166 units (4212, 4461, 4166, 4040, 3950). Although the last two periods show a slight cooling from the peak of 4,461, they remain firmly within the previously established 4,200+ unit regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stable regime, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility (approx 195 units). L is set to default (0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its high-volume pattern, with Period 44 demand (4,444 units) returning to the top end of the current regime after a slight dip in the previous three periods. The average demand for the most recent period block (P40-P44) is approximately 4,212 units, confirming the baseline established around Period 41. Although there was a stockout in Period 44 (ending inventory 0, demand 4,444 vs starting 4,330), this was a minor gap. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and account for the high-volume volatility (std dev in this regime is approx 200-250), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current 4,200+ plateau precisely. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent variability. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for the next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the 4,200-4,450 range: Periods 40-44 average 4,212 units, confirming the plateau first identified in Period 41.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime within the 4,200\u20134,450 range. The average demand over the last seven periods (P39-P45) is approximately 4,234 units. Recent volatility (P44-P45) shows demand alternating around the mean. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (N=6), which covers the current stable plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to capture the current regime's volatility, which is lower than during the growth phases. This configuration ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock' and 'cap' logic are aligned with the current 4,200+ unit baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17684.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate within a high-volume regime. Recent demands were 4040, 3950, 4444, 4364, and 4530 (Periods 42-46). The average over the last 5 periods (N=5) is 4265.6, while the last 3 periods (N=3) show a slight upward trend with an average of 4446. The stockout in Period 46 (demand 4530 vs 4421 available) suggests that setting the mean too close to the previous plateau is risky. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current regime more robustly, and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of ~200-250 units observed in this level. L remains at the promised lead time of 0 as all orders have arrived as expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 4,200-4,500 range: Periods 42-46 average 4,266 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 250.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17924.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistent within the 4,200-4,600 range since Period 40. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is approximately 4,377 units, with Period 47 specifically reaching 4,595. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To capture this high-volume stability while protecting against the slight upward pressure seen in the last two periods (4,530 and 4,595), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N value covers the period from P41 to P47, capturing the full extent of the current stabilized high-volume regime while providing enough historical data points to estimate local variance accurately for the OR backend's inventory calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18036.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching 4,776 units in Period 48. The current regime (since Period 44) demonstrates a clear upward drift within the 4,300-4,800 range. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P44-P48) is approximately 4,542 units, with the most recent sample being the highest in history. Given the consistent stockouts in P46, P47, and P48, and the fact that we are approaching the final period (P50), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4,800 to ensure we meet the current peak and account for potential further growth while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the most recent high-volume regime (Std Dev ~156). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 48 demand reached a new all-time high of 4,776 units. The 5-period average (P44-P48) is now 4,542 units, confirming a shift from the previous 4,200 baseline into a 4,500-4,800 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19732.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new hyper-growth phase, with Period 49 reaching a new all-time high of 5,087 units. The previous plateau of ~4,200 (Periods 39-47) was clearly broken in Period 48 (4,776) and confirmed in Period 49. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P47-P49) is 4,819.3 units, representing a 14% increase from the previous baseline. Because the lead time is 0, the backend OR engine will calculate orders based on (1+L) * mu_hat. To ensure the backend places a Target Stock Level high enough to cover this new 5,000+ unit demand regime and avoid another stockout, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth surge. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility (std ~250) observed in this high-volume stage. L remains 'default' as shipments have consistently arrived in the same period (Lead Time = 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 49 demand reached 5,087 units, confirming a new regime exceeding 5,000 units. The 3-period average (P47-P49) is 4,819 units, distinct from the previous 4,200 plateau.
