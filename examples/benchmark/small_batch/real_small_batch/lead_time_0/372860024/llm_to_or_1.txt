Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Current date 2019-02-11. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values [28, 38, 34, 44, 41], averaging 37.0 with a standard deviation approx 6.24. There is a slight upward trend in recent weeks. Given the high critical fractile (0.8), implying the cost of lost sales is 4x holding cost, we prioritize service level. We utilize the full 5-point history provided to establish a stable baseline for mean and variance. Lead time is promised at 0 periods; valid history is insufficient to deviate from default.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (immediate arrival). Inventory is 0, requiring immediate replenishment. Demand has shifted upwards recently: the last 3 periods (Jan 28, Feb 4, Feb 11) averaged ~42.7 units, whereas the prior 3 averaged ~33.3 units. Given the high breakdown profit margin (CR=0.8), we service this higher recent mean to avoid stockouts. We use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this higher plateau and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to include enough samples for a stable volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand level shift observed: last 3 periods avg ~42.7 vs prior 3 periods avg ~33.3 (+28%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 experienced a significant stockout (Demand 66 vs Ordered 48), indicating the previous forecast (~43) was insufficient for the rising trend. Current inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (immediate delivery). To capture the accelerating demand curve\u2014specifically the spike to 66\u2014I am switching to a reactive short-term forecast using the most recent 3 data points (periods P2, P1, and pre-game Feb 4). This raises the mean estimate to approx 50 units and increases volatility protection, helping to recover service levels while remaining responsive if the spike was an anomaly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-03-04. The product is basic socks (Basic 7p Shaftless). Reviewing recent history: Demand in P1 was 43, P2 was 66, P3 was 57. The average of the last 3 periods is (43+66+57)/3 = 55.33. This is significantly higher than the earlier historical samples provided (Jan/Feb 2019 avg ~37), confirming the upward shift noted in previous insights. The most recent demand (57) is consistent with this higher regime. 

Lead Time Analysis: Orders in P1, P2, and P3 all arrived in the same period (Lead Time = 0). Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed history consistently confirms 0, I will stick to 'default' (or calculating based on recent history which is also 0). 

Inventory Status: Starting on-hand is 5. In-transit is 0. 

Parameter Selection:
- L: 'default' (0 periods) is working perfectly.
- mu_hat: 'recent_N' with N=3. The last 3 periods (43, 66, 57) represent the new higher demand regime much better than the older January data. Using N=3 captures this shift effectively.
- sigma_hat: 'recent_N' with N=3. The volatility in the new regime (std dev of 43, 66, 57 is approx 11.5) is relevant for the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher: recent 3-period avg is ~55.3 units, compared to Jan avg of ~37 units (+49%).

Daily Profit: $176.00, Daily Holding Cost: $22.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11). Current inventory is 22 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 (immediate). Demand history for the last 4 periods is [43, 66, 57, 44]. While Period 4 demand (44) dropped from previous highs, the average over the last 3 periods (55.7) remains significantly higher than the pre-game/Period 1 average. Given the high critical ratio (0.8) favoring availability, I will maintain responsiveness to the recent higher volume regime and volatility. Therefore, I select 'recent_N=3' for demand parameters to capture the mean and variance of [66, 57, 44], ensuring sufficient safety stock against another potential spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized in the low-40s (P4: 44, P5: 43) after a Feb spike (P2: 66, P3: 57). While the immediate trend is lower, we maintain a 5-period window (avg ~50.6) to avoid understocking given the high profit margin and observed volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Feb spike (avg ~61.5) has cooled to ~43.5 in March periods, suggesting the earlier surge was temporary.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/3/25. Period 6 concluded with a demand spike of 73 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This contradicts the 'cooling' trend observed in Periods 4-5 (avg 43.5) and suggests demand volatility is high and persistent. The game-to-date average (Periods 2-6) is ~56.6 units, significantly higher than the pre-game January baseline (~37). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we maintain a high service level. We select 'recent_N=5' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full volatility profile of the active game period, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent spikes while smoothing out the dips. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: High volatility confirmed; Period 6 spike (73 units) invalidated the 'cooling' hypothesis. Active game demand average stabilizes around ~56 units, but with significant variance (range 43-73).

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 demand spiked to 98 units, causing a stockout and clearly invalidating the stabilization theory from Period 6. The demand pattern has shifted to a high-volume, high-volatility regime (recent observations: 43, 73, 98). To prevent further unexpected stockouts given the Profit/Holding ratio of 4:1 (CR=0.8), I am switching to short-term N=3 estimators for both mean and variance. This rapidly adapts the base stock to the current surge (~71 unit average) and the increased unpredictability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated: Period 7 set a new record at 98 units. 3-period average is now ~71.3, significantly exceeding the prior 'cooling' average of ~43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8, Spring): Demand for trainer socks remains elevated (P8: 72, P7: 98, P6: 73), confirming a seasonal shift to a higher volume regime (Avg ~81) compared to early March (~45). I am adopting N=3 for both mean and volatility to aggressively track this spring surge and protect service level (critical ratio ~0.8) against potential stockouts seen in the P7 spike.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime sustained: Last 3 periods (P6-P8) average 81 units, confirming the seasonal breakout from the ~45 unit baseline observed in early March.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April) continues the spring seasonal peak for trainer socks. Demand shifted to a high regime starting Period 6 (March 18), averaging ~78 units over the last 4 periods (P6-P9). While Period 7 (98) appears to be a local peak or outlier, the surrounding periods (73, 72, 69) show a consistent elevated baseline around 70-75 units. I set N=4 for both mu and sigma to capture this entire 4-period spring regime, ensuring the volatility of the P7 spike is included to maintain service levels (target 80%). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand consolidation: Recent periods P8 (72) and P9 (69) align closely with P6 (73), suggesting P7 (98) was likely a peak volatility event rather than the new mean. The sustained average for the last 4 periods is ~78 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation (Period 11, April 22) confirms the 'Spring Plateau' hypothesis formed in previous periods. Demand in Period 10 (78 units) matches the 5-period average (P6-P10) of precisely 78 units. The volatile spike of P7 (98 units) has not repeated, but the baseline remains significantly elevated compared to the early game average (~40). Lead time remains reliably 0. I am switching to 'recent_N=5' for both mu and sigma to discard the irrelevant low-demand winter data and focus entirely on this active spring regime (Avg ~78). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current high-velocity sales environment while accounting for local volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring plateau confirmed: The 5-period average (P6-P10) has stabilized at exactly 78 units, with the most recent period (P10) matching this mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 demand surged to a historical high of 116 units, causing a stockout. The 4:1 Profit-to-Holding cost ratio strongly favors service level over inventory minimization (cost of lost sales is 4x holding cost). Standard moving averages (e.g., N=3 avg of 87.7) drag the forecast down due to lower demand in Periods 9-10. Therefore, I am protecting profit by setting an explicit mean closer to the recent highs (100 units) to bias the order upwards. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the immediate high volatility (std dev ~25). This target base stock (~121 units) fully covers the new peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand peak updated to 116 units (prev max 98). Significant volatility increase; short-term standard deviation (last 3 periods) expanded to ~25 following the surge.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has surged again, establishing a new high-volume regime in late April/early May (avg > 98 over last 2 periods). I am shifting to a short N=4 window for both mean and volatility to capture this peak spring demand (avg ~91.25) and ensure the safety stock adapts to the recent variance (range 69-116).

Carry-over insight: Spring Peak acceleration: Apr/May transition (P11-P12) shows new demand floor around ~100 units, breaking previous ~78 unit plateau.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13. Demand in P13 dropped to 61 after two periods >100. While this lowers the short-term average, the seasonal context (trainer socks in May) and high critical fractile (0.8) argue against cutting inventory too aggressively. We use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (approx 93) to balance the specific recent peaks with the latest drop, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the high ongoing volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Volatility correction observed: Demand dropped to 61 in P13 after the P11-P12 surge (>100), dragging the 3-period average down to ~93. High variance persists.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20. Demand in May (P13: 61, P14: 74) has corrected downward from the April peak (P11: 116, P12: 102), likely indicating the prior surge was driven by Easter/holiday seasonality. However, as this is a warm-weather item (trainer socks), demand should remain robust. The 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio favors aggressive service levels. We select N=4 for mu and sigma to intentionally include the higher volatility and demand of late April in our forecast parameters. This maintains a safety buffer against a demand rebound to ~100 units, which is economically preferable to stocking out. Observed lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday correction confirmed: May demand (avg ~67.5) has dropped significantly from the April peak (avg ~109), stabilizing near pre-surge levels ~70-75.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (May 27) coincides with Memorial Day/Spring Bank Holiday, a key retail event for basics like trainer socks leading into summer. While recent May demand (P13-P15) stabilized around ~70 units, the upcoming holiday warrants a broader lookback window to capture the high-volume potential seen in April (periods 11-12, demand >100). Relying solely on the recent 3-week lull would risk a costly stockout (lost profit $4/unit vs holding cost $1/unit) during a probable demand spike. Therefore, I am extending the observation window to N=5 (P11-P15) for both mean and volatility. This raises the demand forecast to ~86 and volatility to ~22.5, creating a robust inventory buffer (~105 base stock) that accommodates potential holiday traffic while covering the increased variances observed throughout spring.

Carry-over insight: May demand baseline confirmed: P13-P15 averaged ~70 units (range 61-76), establishing a stable early-summer floor following the high-volatility April peak (avg ~109).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17 (June 3, 2019). The item is 'Fine-knit trainer socks in a soft cotton blend', which typically sees strong demand in summer. Historical demand analysis shows meaningful shifts: The high-demand peak in April (avg ~109) cooled in May (avg ~70), but the most recent observation in Period 16 spiked back to 102 units. This suggests the May 'cooling' might have been temporary or demand is now oscillating between 70-100+ as summer formally begins. Given the Critical Service Level of 0.8 (Profit 4/Holding 1), we need to avoid stockouts. The last period (P16) saw demand jump to 102, completely consuming the incoming order and most Safety Stock, leaving us with only 3 units. To capture potential high summer demand without overreacting to single points, I will use a recent_N average with N=6 (covering the post-peak April period through the recent spike) to capture the blend of 70s and 100s, while maintaining a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility: After a May dip (~70), demand surged back to 102 in Period 16, suggesting a return to the higher >100 levels seen in late April.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility persists: P16 spiked to 102, but P17 returned to 76, confirming a jagged summer profile averaging ~78 units (range 61-102) over the last 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17 (Period 19). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', suitable for summer. Demand history continues to show a high-volume, jagged profile typical of the season. While the last two periods (P17: 76, P18: 66) show a cooling trend compared to the P16 spike (102), the 8-period history (P11-P18) reveals significant volatility with peaks up to 116 units. The 8-period average is ~84.1 units with a standard deviation of ~18.5. Given the high cost of stockouts (profit $4 vs holding $1), we prioritize service level by including the high-demand periods in our window. We select N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full Spring/Summer regime volatility (from P11 onwards) and ensure inventory covers potential recurrent spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility consolidation: Recent P17-P18 avg (71) aligns with early May baseline, suggesting the P16 spike (102) was transient; however, the overall Spring/Summer regime remains high-variance (range 61-116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $329.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24). Analyzing recent demand: The period just concluded (P19) had demand 86, which is higher than the P17-P18 average of 71. This suggests demand is still capable of spikes (like P16's 102) but the baseline is somewhat volatile between 60s and 80s. The 4-period average (P16-P19) is (102+76+66+86)/4 = 82.5 units. The 8-period mean (P12-P19) captures the post-April-peak stabilization better, averaging ~80 units. The previous volatility (sigma) remains high due to the jagged profile (range 61-102 in last 5 periods). With L=0 confirmed consistently, we need to cover only 1 period of risk. The on-hand inventory is low (15 units) vs expected demand (~80), so a robust order is needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (to capture the recent summer volatility: 102, 76, 66, 86) and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the fluctuating variance. I'm choosing N=5 because it includes the P16 spike which is relevant for safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand jaggedness continues: Recent 4-period avg (P16-P19) is 82.5, bouncing between 66 and 102.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st). Demand in Period 20 was 69, dipping from P19 (86), confirming the high-volatility 'jagged' summer pattern. The last 5 periods (P16-P20) average ~80 units with a standard deviation of ~14.5. Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), catching the upside spikes is critical. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this full summer profile (including the spike to 102 in P16) rather than reacting too quickly to the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility baseline confirmed: Last 5 periods (P16-P20) consistently average ~80 units with recurring spikes (range 66-102), establishing a high-variance summer regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed P21 arrived P21), so 'default' L is chosen. Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has stabilized into a tighter range (66-86, avg ~75), notably avoiding the >100 unit spikes seen in late Spring. However, given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), simply ignoring the earlier volatility carries risk. I am selecting N=6 for demand parameters to include the Period 16 spike (102 units). This raises the safety stock target slightly (incorporating higher variance) to protect service levels against potential summer demand fluctuations, while acknowledging the recent trend is closer to 75.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility dampening: Last 5 periods (P17-P21) show a stabilizing range (66-86, avg ~75) with no spikes >90, contrasting with the extreme volatility (>100 spikes) observed in May/early June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (July 15). Demand has stabilized significantly in the last 5 periods (mid-summer regime), averaging ~75.4 units with reduced volatility (std dev ~7.9). The extreme variance of late spring (April/May) has subsided. I am selecting 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this calmer, lower-variance baseline and avoid overstocking based on outdated spring peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed: Last 6 periods (P18-P23 context) show tight demand clustering (avg ~75, range 66-86), signaling end of high-volatility Spring regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 demand (73 units) reinforces the summer stabilization trend observed over the last 6 periods (avg ~75 units). With variance significantly dampening compared to April/May (Standard Deviation of last 6 periods is ~7.2), the high-volatility regime appears to have ended. Given the stable lead time of 0 periods, I will use a short moving average (N=6) for both mean and volatility to align inventory with the current calm 'Basic Socks' demand plateau (~75 units) while filtering out the older, irrelevant spring noise.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 25 (2019/7/29). The product is 'Basic 7p Shaftless Socks'. We are in late July, transitioning into August. Demand has shown remarkable stability over the last two months, contrasting with the extreme volatility seen in April/May. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand averages exactly 75 units with a tight range of 69-86. The high volatility 'Spring' regime seems to have fully dissipated into a steady 'Summer' baseline. While lead time remains reliably 0 periods, I will continue to use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 to capture this stable local mean (~75) without being dragged down by early-year low values or dragged up by the specific April outliers. The variance has also compressed significantly; standard deviation over the last 6 periods is only ~6.2, much lower than the ~25 seen earlier. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu and sigma to reflect this local stability. No shipments are missing.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August. We observe a 'Late Summer Cooling' pattern where demand has gently declined over the last 4 weeks (78 -> 78 -> 73 -> 69 -> 63). The extreme volatility from Spring has vanished; the standard deviation over the last 5 periods is very low (~6.5). Given the critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), we prioritize service level but can afford to reduce safety stock due to the lower variance. I am selecting N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture this stabilized, slightly cooling regime (~72 units avg) without reacting too aggressively to the single low point of 63 in P25. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer Cooling confirmed: Demand has trended downward over the last 4 periods (from 78 to 63), bringing the 5-period average to ~72. Volatility has significantly compressed (std dev < 7), ending the high-variance regime seen in Spring.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand continues a clear downward trend (Late Summer Cooling) typical for trainer socks in August. Period 26 demand (51) is the lowest in months. We switch to a tight 3-period average for mu_hat (avg ~61) to avoid overstocking as the season unwinds, while maintaining recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the compressed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer Cooling confirmed: Demand dropped to 51 in Period 26, the lowest since March. The 3-period average falls to ~61, sharply well below the Summer average of ~80, signaling a clear seasonal exit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (Aug 19): Demand has stabilized in a lower late-summer regime following the decline from the July peak. The last 4 periods (P24-P27) average ~62 units, significantly below the early summer average of ~80. Period 27 (64 units) recovered from Period 26 (51 units), suggesting a floor around 60. Current on-hand inventory (6 units) is critically low. We shift parameters to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new lower baseline (~62) without being biased by the obsolete high-demand summer history. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer Stabilization: After the initial drop from summer highs (~78), demand appears to be finding a floor in the low 60s (P27: 64, 4-period avg: ~62).

Late summer cooling confirmed. Demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) averages ~58 units, distinct from the prior ~75 unit summer regime. Adapting parameters to this recent window (N=4) to prevent overstocking as we exit peak season.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer baseline established: P25-P28 average is ~58 units (range 51-64), confirming a distinct regime shift down from the ~75 unit Summer average.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 experienced a stockout (demand 69 vs inventory 64), signaling that the 'Late Summer Cooling' trend (avg ~58) may be bottoming out or exhibiting higher variance as we enter September (Back-to-School season). Demand bounded back to 69 from 53. To respond to this immediate signal and recover inventory levels, I am using a responsive N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~62). I retain N=5 for sigma_hat to smooth volatility estimates. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) confirms the stabilized 'Late Summer/Autumn' demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged ~59.3 units, fluctuating between 51 and 69, which is a distinct step down from the ~80 unit Summer average. The most recent observation (P30=56) aligns perfectly with this lower baseline. Lead time remains reliably 0. We select 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mean and volatility to capture this distinct post-summer cooling period while excluding the higher volatility data from July/August.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (mid-September). Demand has stabilized in the low 60s (last 3 periods avg 62.3), showing a slight recovery from the August dip (which averaged ~56). The 'fine-knit trainer socks' description suggests this may be a transitional item where demand persists into early autumn (e.g., back-to-school sports) before potentially declining or shifting to winter socks. Current inventory is critically low (4 units), requiring immediate replenishment. I am using recent_N=5 for forecast parameters to capture this stabilized 'Early Autumn' baseline (avg ~60.8) while excluding the higher summer volumes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: September periods (P29-P31) average 62.3 units, signaling a slight recovery from the August lows (avg ~56) and establishing a seasonal floor in the low 60s.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand spiked unexpectedly to 90 units, significantly exceeding the recent 'Autumn baseline' of ~60 units and causing a stockout. This sudden +50% increase likely signals the onset of Q4/cold-weather seasonality for socks (current date Sep 30). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the policy must react quickly to this potential trend shift. We switch to a responsive 'recent_N' with N=3 for both demand and volatility to incorporate the 90-unit signal immediately and increase safety stock, while keeping lead time at the reliable observed 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Volatility Spike: Period 33 demand jumped to 90 (+50% vs recent ~60 avg), breaking the stable late-summer regime and causing a stockout. This likely marks the start of volatile Q4 seasonality.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7): Demand has stabilized at a higher level (69 units) following the P33 spike (90), confirming a shift to Autumn seasonality. The recent 3-period average is ~71, up from the summer baseline of ~60. Volatility has returned, necessitating responsive parameters. I am using recent_N=3 for both mean and sigma to align inventory with this erratic, higher-volume Q4 texture.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility confirmed: The P33 spike (90) was not just an outlier but signaled a shift to a higher, more volatile regime. Recent average (P32-P34) is ~71 units with high variance (range 53-90), distinct from the stable ~60 unit baseline of September.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Autumn volatility is high. Demand in the last 3 periods ranged from 53 to 90. The 5-period average is ~65, but recent instability suggests sticking to a reactive recent_N approach to capture the variance. Using N=5 captures the spike in P33 and the subsequent correction, ensuring safety stock accounts for this range.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility persisting: After the P33 spike (90), demand has been choppy (69, then 53 in P35). The 5-period average (P31-P35) is ~65.4, but the high variance (std dev ~14) confirms a shift away from the stable Summer regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21) reinforces a high-volatility Autumn profile. While the massive spike in Period 33 (90 units) signaled potential seasonal growth, recent periods P35 and P36 have reverted to a much lower baseline (~52-53 units). This creates a 'jagged' demand pattern where the mean is unstable. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1, critical ratio=0.8), relying solely on the recent low demand puts us at risk of another spike. Therefore, I am using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the P33 spike (90) alongside the recent lows (52), producing a moderate mean forecast (~63) but a high standard deviation (~16.5). This high standard deviation inflates the safety stock, ensuring sufficient inventory to cover another potential spike while acknowledging the current lower trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility/correction: Demand has reverted to the low 50s (P35: 53, P36: 52) following the P33 spike (90). This confirms a jagged regime characterized by a lower baseline (~52-60) punctuated by sharp, unpredictable spikes, rather than a sustained lift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
October demand has stabilized low (approx 52 units for P35-P37), but broad Autumn variance remains high (50-90). Using a 5-period window for parameters captures both the recent calm and the volatility of late Sep, providing a buffer against approaching holiday seasonality in Nov/Dec.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: October periods (P35-P37) show localized stabilization at ~51.7 units, correcting the September volatility, but range remains high (50-90) over the 5-period window.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) marks the start of the holiday/winter buildup for socks. Current status: On-hand=27, In-transit=0. Recent demand (P35-P38) has been exceptionally stable but low, averaging ~51.5 units (53, 52, 50, 51). This low-volatility lull follows the September volatility spike (90 units in P33). However, given the product category (Socks/Nightwear) and the calendar (November), a demand increase is imminent due to colder weather and holiday shopping. While the recent 4-week average is ~52, relying solely on this low baseline carries stockout risk if the holiday ramp-up begins abruptly. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering the P33 spike) to capture a blended view of the volatile transition (high of 90, low of 50, avg ~63) rather than just the recent lull. This prudently increases safety stock ahead of the expected seasonal lift without overreacting before the signal arrives.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stabilization confirmed: October demand (P35-P38) consistently averaged ~51.5 units with negligible variance, forming a clear pre-holiday baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is approaching the winter holiday season. While recent October demand (P35-P39) has been remarkably stable and low (avg ~45.6, with a sharp drop to 22 in P39 likely due to a random fluctuation or calendar quirk), historical patterns for socks suggest increasing consumption in November/December. The drop to 22 in P39 is potentially an outlier or a pre-holiday lull before the Black Friday/holiday surge. Given the stable autumn baseline (~52-53) prior to this drop, I will anchor the forecast to the last 5 periods but keep a responsive sigma to handle the volatility seen in September (spike to 90) and the unknown holiday lift. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly in Period 39: Demand dropped sharply to 22 units (vs ~52 baseline), creating a significant deviation (-57%). This reinforces the high-volatility nature of the SKU seen in Spring/Summer, suggesting autumn stability may be fragile.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18). Demand remains severely depressed (P39: 22, P40: 23) compared to the October baseline of ~52. This sudden 55% drop persists for a second week. While this might be a pre-Black Friday dip or a stock-outage artifact elsewhere, the consistency (22, 23) suggests a new, temporary low regime. However, Black Friday (late Nov) and December holidays are imminent. Historical Q1 data shows demand ~40, but Spring/Summer peaks reached ~100+. Given the high profit ratio (0.8), we must balance the current low demand with the risk of a Q4 holiday surge. A purely reactive forecast (avg of last 2) would be dangerously low (~22.5) if demand snaps back. Using a broader recent window (N=5) captures the tail end of the ~50 baseline while acknowledging the drop, providing a safety buffer (avg ~40). This prevents overreacting to the dip while preparing for potential holiday recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse confirmed: Nov periods (P39-P40) avg 22.5 units, down >55% from Oct baseline (~52). This appears to be a distinct pre-holiday trough or anomaly.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 corresponds to the week of Nov 25 (Black Friday). While recent demand (P39-P41) has collapsed to an average of ~23.3 units (likely a pre-holiday trough or seasonal shift for trainer socks), the upcoming holiday sales event presents a significant upside risk. Relying solely on the recent 3-week low (N=3) risks a stockout if demand rebounds during the promo week. Therefore, I am using N=5 (incorporating late Oct data) for both mu and sigma. This sets a higher baseline (~34) and high volatility (~14), resulting in a base stock (~46) that buffers against a potential Black Friday demand spike while acknowledging the lower seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Holiday Trough verified: Nov periods (P39-P41) stabilized at ~23.3 units, significantly below the Oct baseline (~51). This lull likely precedes Black Friday volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (Dec 2) marks the immediate onset of the holiday shopping peak (Cyber Monday week). While November (Periods 39-41) showed a distinct pre-holiday lull (avg ~23 units), Period 42 saw demand nearly double to 45 units, signaling the end of the trough and the start of the December surge. Historical context suggests demand can spike significantly in December. The 4-period average (P39-P42) is ~29, but this is heavily dragged down by the lull and unresponsive to the new upward trend. To prepare for the holiday peak, I will switch to a very short-term weighted average (recent_N=3) to quickly adapt to the rising slope, while maintaining the zero lead time assumption which has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Holiday surge onset confirmed: Period 42 demand (45) nearly doubled the Nov trough baseline (~23), signaling the end of the pre-holiday lull and the start of December seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (Dec 9): The pre-holiday lull in November (~23 units) has ended, but demand is recovering erratically. Period 42 spiked to 45 units (marking the start of the holiday ramp), but Period 43 surprisingly dipped back to 28 units. This volatility is characteristic of the initial December build-up. With only 14 units on-hand and Christmas approaching, the risk of stockout is high. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 2 active 'recovery' periods and the expectation of December seasonality seen in similar retail contexts, while increasing sigma_hat to account for the jarring variance (28 vs 45) seen in the last two weeks. The goal is to rapidly build inventory for the peak weeks ahead without overreacting to the single low data point in P43.

Carry-over insight: December volatility onset: Early Dec demand is choppy (P42: 45, P43: 28), averaging ~36.5 units, which is still +56% above the Nov trough (~23.3).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 16 (Period 45), the final full shopping week before Christmas. While socks are traditional gifts, this SKU is 'trainer socks' (ankle socks), which historically peaked in Spring/Summer (Periods 11-17, demand >100). Recent demand (P42-44) averages ~35.3, a moderate recovery (+53%) from the Nov trough (~23) but significantly below peak season levels. The volatility is high (range 28-45), and lead times remain reliable at 0. Choosing recent_N=3 for both Mu and Sigma to stay responsive to potential last-minute gift buying spikes without over-forecasting based on seasonality that may not fully apply to this specific product style.

Carry-over insight: December demand stabilization: P42-P44 average ~35.3 units. While +50% above Nov lows, demand for 'trainer socks' remains well below Spring/Summer peaks (70-100), suggesting seasonal mismatch for this specific SKU despite general holiday traffic.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) represents the peak Christmas week. Demand in Period 45 spiked unexpectedly to 81 units (a +145% increase from the prior 3-week average of ~33), causing a stockout. This spike breaks the previous 'seasonal mismatch' theory; while trainer socks are less popular in winter, the general gift-giving surge of late December overrides product-specific seasonality. However, since the current period is Dec 23, this is the final opportunity for holiday sales. Immediately after Christmas, demand for giftable items typically crashes. Given the massive stockout last period (demand 81 vs inventory 43) and zero starting inventory, I must react to the surge but be cautious of the imminent post-holiday drop-off. I will use a short-term average (recent_N=3) to catch the elevated holiday volume (avg ~47) but not overreact to the single outlier of 81, as the season ends next week. High volatility justifies a reactive sigma.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Spike Confirmed: Period 45 demand surged to 81 units (vs ~33 baseline), causing a stockout. This contradicts the 'low winter demand' hypothesis, indicating that general gift-giving traffic lifts even off-season categories like trainer socks during the final pre-Christmas push.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to Dec 30th, the immediate post-Christmas week. Demand in Period 46 (Dec 23) was strong at 67 units, following a peak of 81 in P45, confirming a holiday surge distinct from the November lull (~23 units). However, post-Christmas demand typically drops significantly as gift-giving ceases, though January sales (fitness resolutions affecting 'trainer socks') may maintain a moderate baseline. The current on-hand inventory is critically low (5 units) with 0 in-transit. While the immediate holiday spike is likely over, cutting orders too aggressively risks stockouts if the New Year 'fitness' bump occurs. I will switch to a `recent_N` method with N=5 (capturing the lead-up to Christmas and the spikes) rather than N=3 to average out the extreme peak of 81 while still respecting the higher Dec baseline (~35-67) compared to Nov. This provides a buffer against remaining holiday traffic or New Year demand. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 81 (P45) and 67 (P46), averaging ~74 during the core Christmas weeks, contrasting sharply with the Nov trough (~23).
