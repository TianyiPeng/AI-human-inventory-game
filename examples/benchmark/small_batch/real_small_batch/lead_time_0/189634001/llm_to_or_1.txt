Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Historical data (Jan-Feb 2019) indicates stable demand averaging ~53 units/period with mild volatility (std dev ~5.0). Most recent demand (46) is slightly below average but within normal fluctuation range for basic leggings. Promised lead time is 0 periods, allowing immediate replenishment before demand realization. Initializing parameters using all available history (N=5) to establish a robust baseline service level (Target 80%, Profit/Cost ratio 4:1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The demand history shows a very high spike in Period 1 (201) followed by a return to more moderate levels in Period 2 (77), which is still higher than the pre-game average (~53). This suggests the Period 1 spike might have been an anomaly or an initial stock-up event, but the baseline has shifted upwards slightly from the historical average of ~53 to ~77. Given the limited data (two observations: 201, 77), relying solely on the pre-game history (avg 52.8) would lead to understocking, but reacting fully to the 201 outlier is risky. A recent_N=5 approach on the demand (mu_hat) will blend the new high data points (77, 201) with the historical tail (46, 52, 52), producing a safer, slightly elevated average (approx 85) without overreacting. For lead time, observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Sigma is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility introduced by the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in P2 (77) after P1 spike (201), suggesting P1 was an outlier, though the new baseline (~77) remains above historical average (~53).

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (Mar 4) context: Demand in P3 (57) has nearly returned to the historical average (approx 53), suggesting the P1 spike (201) and P2 elevation (77) were transient (likely Valentine's related, Feb 11-14). Including P1 in standard calculations would artificially inflate mean and variance, causing costly overstocking given the holding cost ($1). I am therefore using explicit parameters derived from the non-outlier history (P2, P3, and pre-game) to target a baseline demand around 60-65 units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand return to baseline confirmed: P3 demand (57) aligns with pre-game history (~53), validating P1 (201) as a seasonal outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11). Demand in P4 (50) confirms the return to historical baseline (~53 units) observed in P3 (57), definitively signaling that the P1 spike (201) was an isolated outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I apply 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility parameters; while the strict stable regime is P3-P4 (length 2), the decision rule enforces a minimum N=3. Including P2 (77) in the average slightly elevates the forecast (mean ~61 vs baseline ~53) and volatility, providing a prudent safety buffer against potential demand noise while successfully excluding the massive P1 distortion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 demand (60) falls within the high end of the pre-game normal range (46-60) and recent stable history (P3-P5). While the extreme outlier of P1 (201) is clearly anomalous, P2 (77) represents a moderate fluctuation that should not be ignored given the high critical ratio (0.8). Therefore, we select N=4 for forecasting parameters. This window (P2-P5) excludes the P1 outlier while effectively effectively averaging the stable periods (50-60) with the moderate spike of P2 (77), ensuring sufficient safety stock without gross overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7 (March 25). Demand has stabilized at ~53.75 units (avg of last 4 periods: 57, 50, 60, 48), effectively returning to pre-game historical levels. The massive outlier in Period 1 (201) is no longer relevant for short-term forecasting. Lead time remains strictly 0. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the P1 outlier and prevent excess holding costs driven by inflated variance. Current inventory (23) is low relative to demand (~54), so a replenishment order is expected.

Carry-over insight: Stable demand regime confirmed ~54 units/period (P3-P6 avg: 53.75) with low volatility; P1 outlier fully excluded from forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 begins with a stockout (0 on-hand) after Period 7 demand (73) exceeded the recent average (~53), resulting in lost sales. Actual lead time remains reliably 0 periods. To recover inventory and buffer against the demonstrated volatility in P7, I am setting forecast parameters based on the last 5 periods (P3-P7). This window effectively excludes the extreme outlier in P1 (201) while incorporating the higher recent variance from P7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 9 (April 8). Inventory exhausted (0 units) following stockouts in P7 and P8 where demand (73, 69) significantly exceeded the previous stable average (~54). This recent lift (+30%) suggests a seasonal transition (Spring). Lead time remains consistently 0. To recover service levels and adapt to the higher demand regime, I am shortening the forecast window to N=3. This sets the target based on the recent surge (avg ~63) rather than dampening it with the lower historical values, aiming to build sufficient stock to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand surging: P7 (73) and P8 (69) average 71, markedly higher than the P3-P6 baseline (~53.75).

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 demand dropped to 46, breaking the upward trend seen in P7-P8 (avg 71) and suggesting high volatility rather than a sustained surge. With Easter approaching in late April (Period 11), demand may fluctuate. Using recent_N=5 (approx 59 units) for mu_hat strikes a balance between the recent surge and the P9 drop, while N=5 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility (ranging from 46 to 73). The critical fractile (0.8) naturally buffers against stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatility confirmed: P9 demand (46) countered the P7-P8 surge (avg 71), establishing a volatile regime with a 5-period average of ~59 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (April 22) context: Demand behavior has been volatile recently. While Periods 7-8 showed a surge (avg 71), Periods 9-10 (46, 41) have dropped significantly below the historical average (~53) and the recent spike. The 4-period average (P7-P10) is 57.25, which is surprisingly close to the long-term stable mean, suggesting the surge was transient. However, recent volatility is high (std dev of last 4 periods is ~16). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the drop in demand in P9-P10, sticking to a recent N=4 approach captures both the surge and the correction without overreacting to the dip immediately. The Critical Ratio is 0.8 (Profit 4/Hold 1), justifying a service level that covers this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Recent 4-period avg (57.25) aligns with historical baseline despite surge in P7-P8, indicating transient spikes rather than regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12 (late April). Demand demonstrates a noticeable cooling trend over the last three periods (P9: 46, P10: 41, P11: 37), averaging 41.3 units, which is significantly below the historical baseline of ~53. However, the high profit margin ($4 vs $1 holding cost, critical ratio 0.8) incentivizes maintaining service levels. Because the recent 5-period window includes the surcharge in P7-P8 (73, 69) as well as the recent drop, using `recent_N`=5 generates a conservative mean (~53) and a higher standard deviation (~16.5), creating a safety stock buffer. This protects against a rebound in demand while the forecast gradually adjusts downward if the trend persists. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed P9-P11: avg 41.3 units with steady decline (46->41->37), falling below established historical baseline (~53).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/5/6 (Spring). Demand summary: The consistent downward/cooling trend observed in P9-P11 (46, 41, 37) has stabilized slightly in P12 (45), but overall demand remains below the historical average (~53) and significantly below the early spring peaks. The most recent 4-period average (P9-P12) is ~42.25 units. There is no evidence of lost shipments; all orders P1-P12 arrived with 0 lead time. Given the lower recent demand (cooling trend likely due to seasonality as weather warms), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this lower baseline (~42) rather than the inflated long-term history which includes the Feb/March spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at lower level confirmed: P9-P12 avg ~42.25, consistently below long-term historical average (~53).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (mid-May) indicates a continued cooling trend for 'Long Leg Leggings', likely due to seasonal transition to warmer weather. Demand in Period 13 dropped to a new low of 31 units. The recent 5-period average (P9-P13) is 40.0 units, significantly below the pre-season baseline of ~53 and the peak surges. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service for the Profit/Holding ratio of 4.0 (0.8 fractile), I am switching to a recent_N=5 forecast which captures this lower demand regime (avg 40, std ~6.2) without reacting over-aggressively to the single low of 31. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline confirmed: May demand (P9-P13 avg 40.0) has settled significantly below the historical average (~53), with a new low of 31 in P13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20. Demand has stabilized at a lower seasonal level (approx 40 units/period) for the last 5 weeks (P10-P14 avg=39.8), significantly below the early year average. Given the critical inventory level (1 unit), we set parameters to reflect this recent regime using N=5. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline stabilized: P10-P14 demand averages 39.8 units, consistently below historical baseline (~53) and P1 outlier, indicating a sustained lower-volume regime for late spring.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (Late May). Inventory is stocked out (0 units) following an unexpected demand spike in P15 (60 units), which significantly exceeded the recent 'cooling' average of ~40 units observed in periods 9-14. This spike challenges the assumption of a steady seasonal decline. Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods. To adapt to this resurfacing volatility without overreacting to a single point, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility. This captures the oscillation between the recent lows (31 in P13) and the new high (60 in P15), ensuring the base stock level rises to prevent further stockouts while respecting the generally lower spring volume compared to winter.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility resurgence: P15 demand (60) broke the established P9-P14 cooling trend (avg ~40), contradicting the steady seasonal decline hypothesis and causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (June 3) follows two consecutive stockouts in P15 and P16, confirming that the low-demand 'spring dip' (P9-P13) has ended. Demand has rebounded to the historical baseline, averaging ~53 units over the last 3 periods (P14: 45, P15: 60, P16: 54). With 0 inventory on hand and high stockout costs (Ratio 0.8), the strategy shifts to aggressive recovery. We use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to align strictly with the higher recent demand levels (avg 53) rather than the older dip. We use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the full volatility range (from low 31 to high 60), ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Spring cooling trend ended: Demand P14-P16 (avg 53) has rebounded to historical baseline levels (~53), definitively ending the low-volume period observed in P9-P13 (avg ~40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) context analysis: Demand in Period 17 dropped unexpectedly to 34 units after a rebound in P15-P16 (54-60 units). This creates a volatile picture: P13-P14 were low (31, 45), P15-P16 were high (60, 54), and P17 is low (34). The rolling average over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is ~44.8, which is lower than the long-term historical average (~53). The drop in P17 suggests the 'rebound' might have been short-lived or noise, and we are returning to the lower summer volume seen in May. Given the high volatility (sigma is critical here), relying on a recent window (recent_5) captures this fluctuation better than the full history which is skewed by early high demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. With 29 units on hand, we are below recent average demand, risking stockouts if demand swings back up. I will use recent_5 for mu_hat to reflect the ~45 unit level and recent_5 for sigma_hat to capture the significant volatility (ranging from 31 to 60) to ensure the safety stock is adequate.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility established: P13-P17 shows high variance (lows of 31/34, highs of 60/54) with an average of ~45, distinctly lower and more unstable than the early-year baseline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date (mid-June) and recent demand (P17: 34, P18: 32) affirm a summer cooling trend for leggings. However, prior volatility (P15: 60, P16: 54) suggests demand is unstable rather than uniformly low. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 (avg ~45, sensitive to both the recent lows and May highs) balances the lower trend with sufficient safety stock to cover sudden spikes seen in late May. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June) confirms a distinct 'Summer Low' regime. After the brief rebound in late May (P15-P16 avg ~57), demand has dropped and stabilized significantly lower in June: P17 (34), P18 (32), P19 (30). The 3-period average is 32.0, well below the long-term historical average of ~53. This aligns with seasonal expectations for 'Long Leg Leggings' being less popular in summer. To prevent overstocking holding costs in this low-demand environment, we invoke 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu_hat to track the current mean closely. We maintain 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat to include the volatility of the recent drop from 60 to 30 as a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Summer low usage regime confirmed: June demand (P17-P19) averages 32.0 units with low variance, marking a distinct and sustained drop from May levels (avg ~53) and the historical baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Entering July (Period 21), the summer low-demand regime for 'Long Leg Leggings' is firmly established. Demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) has been remarkably stable (34, 32, 30, 32), averaging 32.0 units with negligible variance. This seasonal trough is distinct from the historical average (~53) and earlier spring volatility. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to align the inventory policy strictly with this current summer baseline, preventing overstocking that would occur if using the higher historical average.

Carry-over insight: Summer low usage stability confirmed: P17-P20 demand rigidly stable (34, 32, 30, 32), avg 32.0, reinforcing seasonal trough for Long Leg Leggings through late June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) continues the stable summer low-volume regime for these leggings. Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has been remarkably consistent: 34, 32, 30, 32, 33 (Avg ~32.2). This confirms the seasonal trough identified in June persists into July. We use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to isolate this stable summer behavior and exclude the higher variance seen in Spring (P16 was 54) or Winter. This prevents overstocking given the high holding cost ($1/unit) relative to profit, while maintaining sufficient stock for the steady ~32 unit demand. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau confirmed: July demand (P21: 33) aligns perfectly with June's average (32.0), reinforcing the low-volume, high-stability regime for this SKU.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (July 15). Demand for Long Leg Leggings has entered a highly stable 'summer low' regime. Since Period 17, demand has fluctuated narrowly between 30 and 34 units (last 6 periods: 34, 32, 30, 32, 33, 30), averaging ~31.8 units. This is significantly lower than the historical average and lacks the volatility seen in spring. With inventory critically low at 4 units, we must replenish to meet this consistent demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mean and volatility to target this specific stable regime, avoiding the high safety stocks that global history (with its early outliers) would dictate. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer stability persists: P17-P22 demand tightly clustered (avg 31.8, range 30-34) with negligible volatility, confirming a sustained low-volume mid-summer pattern.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 demand spiked to 50 units, significantly breaking the stable summer trough regime (avg ~32, P17-P22). This +56% jump coincides with mid-July, likely signaling the start of 'Back-to-School' or early autumn retail seasonality where demand returns to the historical baseline (~53). On-hand inventory stocked out in P23. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we abandon the low-volume summer forecast immediately. We set mu_hat explicitly to 53 (aligning with P23 and historical active-season average) to avoid lagging adjustment. We use recent_N=5 for sigma to let the P23 volatility spike increase safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-volume regime ended P23: Demand jumped to 50 (vs ~32 summer avg), causing stockout. Likely returning to historical mean ~53 as seasonal transition begins.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29) continues the late summer volatility pattern. After a stable low-volume trough throughout June/early July (~32 units), demand spiked in P23 (50) but immediately reverted to 28 in P24. This suggests the P23 spike was likely an aberration or a brief spot-buy rather than an immediate return to high season, though the overall trend suggests we are approaching the end of the summer lull (August often begins the back-to-school transition). Given the reversion to 28 in P24, the 'recent_N' average using the last 8 periods adequately captures both the low baseline and the variance from the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast (~33 units) that doesn't overreact to the single spike while protecting against stocks-outs with the volatility measure. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility confirmed: P23 spike (50) followed by P24 drop (28) disrupts the stable low-volume regime (avg ~32), indicating potential start of transition volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August, marking the start of the 'Back to School' / Fall transition for retail apparel. This fits the observed data: the stable low-volume summer regime (avg ~32) has been broken by significant volatility and spikes in Period 23 (50) and Period 25 (62), despite a dip in Period 24 (28). Inventory is currently stocked out (0 units) due to the Period 25 surge. To address the rapid regime shift and high volatility (standard deviation of last 3 periods is ~17), I am setting parameters based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3). This excludes the now-irrelevant quiet summer data and allows the system to react quickly to the upward trend and erratic demand typical of seasonal transitions. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-volume regime definitively ended: Demand P23-P25 averages 46.7 with high volatility (range 28-62), likely signaling Fall transition/Back-to-School spikes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 represents mid-August, a transition period towards Fall/Back-to-School. The observation of Period 26 (demand 42) combined with P23-P25 confirms a volatile transition regime (avg ~45.5) that is distinct from the stable Summer trough (avg ~32) and the earlier Spring baseline (~53). The 'Summer low-volume' regime is definitively over. I am using recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to explicitly calculate parameters based solely on this new transitionary phase (P23-P26), excluding the irrelevant low-demand data of June/July. The high volatility (range 28-62) necessitates a fresher sigma estimate to maintain service levels during this unpredictable seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Fall transition regime confirmed: P23-P26 demand averages 45.5 units (vs ~32 in summer), characterized by high volatility (range 28-62) as the season shifts.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (Aug 19) places us firmly in the Back-to-School / Fall transition window for Leggings. Demand has definitively recovered from the summer trough (avg ~32), with the last 3 periods (P25-P27) averaging 52.3 units, essentially restoring the historical spring baseline of ~53 units. Volatility remains high (ranging 28-62 over the last 5 periods), necessitating a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am switching 'mu_hat' to use the most recent 3 periods to fully capture the restored demand level (ignoring the lower summer values), and 'sigma_hat' to the last 5 periods to capture the recent chop (range 28-62) without being skewed by the chaotic Period 1 spike.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand recovery confirmed: P25-P27 avg 52.3 matches Spring baseline (~53), effectively ending the Summer trough (~32) and establishing a higher-volume regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 corresponds to late August throughout the 'Back-to-School' season, a peak time for leggings. Demand has confirmed a strong upward trend (P26:42 -> P27:53 -> P28:64), fully recovering from the summer trough and now exceeding the spring baseline (~53). The most recent observation (64) suggests the high-volume regime is active. We treat P24 (28) as the end of the summer season and exclude it. We focus on the last 4 periods (P25-P28) using 'recent_N' to capture this new high-volume, volatile regime (Avg ~55.25, Max 64). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School momentum confirmed: P28 demand (64) is the highest since April, reinforcing the upward trend; recent 4-period average (~55) now exceeds the long-term historical mean.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 demand (44) confirms the Fall/Back-to-School regime is fully active, characterized by a return to higher volumes and significant volatility. The last 5 periods (P25-P29) average 53 units, which aligns perfectly with the pre-summer historical baseline (exclude P1 outlier, P3-P6 avg ~53.75). The summer trough (avg ~32) is definitively over. Volatility is high (range 42-64 in recent weeks). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to align the forecast with this restored baseline of ~53 units and capture the current dispersion, ensuring sufficient stock for probable peaks (like P25's 62 or P28's 64).

Carry-over insight: Fall regime solidifies: P25-P29 demand averages 53 units, matching the Spring baseline (~53.75), effectively closing the Summer trough chapter. Volatility remains elevated (range 42-64).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (early September). The frantic Back-to-School volatility observed in August (P25-P28, peaks of 62/64) appears to be subsiding, with demand stabilizing exactly at 44 units for P29 and P30. This level (44) is slightly below the broader Fall transition average of ~51.5 (P25-P30). Given the high cost of lost sales relative to holding ($4 vs $1) and the recent history of stockouts (P23, P25, P28), I will maintain a robust forecast using recent_N=6 to include the high-demand signals from August in the average (~51.5). This provides a buffer if demand spikes again while acknowledging the recent cooling. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School stabilization observed: P29-P30 demand identical at 44 units, suggesting the high volatility of the August transition (P25-P28, range 28-64) has subsided.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/9/16 (Period 32). We are now in mid-September, firmly in the Fall/Back-to-School season. Detailed Analysis: Demand in Period 31 was 59 units, continuing the higher-volume Fall regime. The summer trough (avg ~32) is definitively over. The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31: 53, 64, 44, 44, 59) average 52.8 units, which is notably aligned with the long-term historical average (~53) and the pre-summer spring baseline. Volatility remains present (range 44-64), but the mean seems to have restabilized around the low-50s. On-hand is critically low at 1 unit, making stockout risk high if demand spikes again (like P28's 64). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (dating back to mid-August) to capture the full Fall recovery pattern while excluding the Summer low. I'll maintain 'default' sigma_hat as total history variance (approx 13-14) reasonably covers the current volatility without overreacting to single spikes, but given the critical inventory level, I'm relying on the service level calculation (via z*) to handle safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall stabilization confirmed: P27-P31 avg 52.8 units matches long-term historical baseline (~53), verifying a complete exit from the Summer trough.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Sep 23) analysis: The Fall/Back-to-School regime is firmly established. Demand in P27-P32 has averaged 54 units (53, 64, 44, 44, 59, 60), which aligns with the historical pre-Spring baseline (~53). The high volatility seen in August (28-64 range) has steadied somewhat but remains present. The recent 6-period average is 54.0, and the most recent 2 periods averaged 59.5, suggesting strong continued demand. I will use a recent_N=6 approach for mu_hat to capture this stable high-volume Fall plateau, ignoring the Summer trough data. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=6 to capture the current volatility profile (range 44-64). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sept 30). We are observing a significant demand shock in Period 33 (109 units), which is the highest demand since Week 1. This drastically breaks the previous Fall Stabilization regime (avg ~53). Given the product is 'Long Leg Leggings' and we are entering October/Autumn, this spike likely represents the start of peak cold-weather seasonality. The previous Fall stabilization period (P27-P32) averaged ~53 units, so a jump to 109 is a ~100% increase. While it could be a single outlier, stockouts are costly (profit margin 80%), and failing to react to a seasonal uptrend is risky. I will switch to using the most recent 2 periods (P32-P33) to capture this upward shift aggressively, assuming demand is now elevating significantly above the ~53 baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall Demand Spike confirmed: Period 33 demand (109) nearly doubled the prior Fall baseline (~53), signalling the onset of peak cold-weather seasonality for leggings.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 corresponds to early October, a peak season for leggings. While Period 33 showed a massive spike to 109 units (Fall peak onset), Period 34 demand reverted to 54, aligning with the P27-P32 baseline. This confirms a high-volatility regime rather than a sustained doubling of demand. We use recent_N=5 for demand and variability to incorporate the spike (keeping safety stock high) without over-indexing on a single outlier, resulting in a target base stock that balances the risk of another spike against holding costs. Lead time remains effectively 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall volatility established: P34 demand (54) reverted to baseline after P33 spike (109), indicating high variance (P30-P34 range 44-109) rather than a sustained >100 regime. 5-period average elevated to ~65.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 corresponds to mid-October, heavily reinforcing the peak season for 'Long Leg Leggings'. Recent demand history (P32-P35: 60, 109, 54, 83) exhibits high volatility and a significantly elevated average (~76.5) compared to the Summer/early-Fall baseline. The pattern appears oscillatory (spike, normalize, spike), necessitating a responsive forecast to prevent stockouts during demand surges (like P33's 109 units). I am adopting 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mu and sigma to capture this specific Fall volatility and ensure the base stock covers these higher peaks (e.g., ~100+ units) given the reliable 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Fall volatility intensifies: P35 demand (83) reinforces the oscillatory high-volume pattern seen in P33 (109), establishing a new fluctuating baseline averaging ~82 units over the last 3 weeks.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21) confirms 'Long Leg Leggings' have entered high-volume/high-volatility Fall seasonality. Recent demand (P33: 109, P34: 54, P35: 83, P36: 64) averages 77.5, significantly above the P30-P32 baseline (~54). The variance is extreme (54 to 109), suggesting oscillating weekly demand likely driven by weather snaps or promotions. With lead time=0, we must cover the immediate period's potential spike. Using a short 4-period window for mu_hat captures the recent regime shift (~77.5) while accounting for volatility. Sigma is similarly based on this volatile recent period to ensure safety stock covers spikes like P33. No missing shipments observed.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-volatility regime confirmed: P33-P36 average 77.5 units with extreme range (54-109), significantly exceeding prior baselines.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 is late October, deep into the high season for leggings. Demand behavior in the last 5 periods (P33-P37) has been extremely volatile, oscillating between highs of 109/83 and lows of 54/42. The most recent observation (P37: 42) is a significant dip, but given the seasonal context (Halloween/approaching Winter), it is safer to treat this as volatility rather than a demand collapse. The 5-period average remains elevated (~70.4) compared to historical norms. To maintain service levels during this high-margin, high-variance peak season, I am maintaining selected parameters N=5 for both mean and volatility. This window captures the full range of recent swings (including the 109 spike) to ensure safety stock is sufficient for potential rebounds in demand.

Carry-over insight: Fall volatility continues with significant oscillation: P37 demand dropped to 42, contrasting sharply with P33 (109) and P35 (83), confirming a jagged demand pattern (range 42-109) rather than a smooth plateau.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date is 2019/11/4. Demand in Period 38 (43 units) confirmed the localized dip seen in Period 37 (42 units), contrasting sharply with the spikes in P33 (109) and P35 (83). This establishes a 'jagged' high-volatility regime for Fall/Q4, where demand oscillates violently between highs (~80-100) and lows (~40). Given the high cost of stockouts ($4 margin vs $1 holding) and the time of year (November cold weather/pre-holiday), relying solely on the recent 2-week low is dangerous. I am using recent_N=6 to encompass the entire Fall volatility window (P33-P38). This sets the forecast mean around ~66 and captures the high standard deviation, ensuring safety stock is sufficient to cover another potential rebound spike while avoiding excessive overstocking if the lull continues.

Carry-over insight: Fall oscillation confirmed: P37-P38 demand (avg 42.5) establishes a distinct low-volume trough within the volatile Fall regime, contrasting with the P33-P36 high-volume phase (avg 77.5). Range remains extreme (42-109).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is deep in the Fall season. While demand has stabilized in a lower trough for the last 3 periods (P37-P39 avg ~45), the broader Fall regime (P33-P39) has been characterized by extreme volatility and high spikes (109, 83). Given the high cost of stockouts ($4) relative to holding ($1), it is risky to calibrate solely on the recent 3-week lull. I am choosing a 7-period window (N=7) for estimation. This captures the Fall spikes (P33, P35) in the mean (~63) and variance, ensuring a robust safety stock buffer against potential holiday demand surges, rather than overfitting to the recent quiet weeks.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand dampening confirmed: P37-P39 average 44.7 units (range 42-49), marking a sustained 3-week lull with low volatility, distinct from the preceding high-volatility phase (P33-P36 avg 77.5).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 18 (Period 41). We are entering the critical pre-Black Friday window. While recent demand (P37-P40) has been surprisingly low and stable (avg ~44.25), the broader Fall season (P33-P36) showed limits up to 109. Relying solely on the recent lull (N=4) risks a major stockout if demand returns to seasonal/holiday norms. I am selecting N=8 for both mu and sigma to incorporate the high-volume/high-volatility data from late Sept/Oct (avg ~61, high std dev). This creates a higher base stock level to buffer against the expected holiday demand surge, prioritizing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lull confirmed: P37-P40 demand averages 44.25 units (range 42-49), a distinct low-volume regime compared to early Fall (P33-P36 avg 77.5).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) represents the onset of the holiday shopping season (post-Thanksgiving/Black Friday window). Demand in P41 dropped unexpectedly to 31, the lowest since mid-summer, while the P37-P40 average was ~44. However, historical behavior for this SKU (leggings) shows extreme volatility in Fall/Winter (spikes to 109 in P33, 83 in P35). The recent lull (P37-P41 avg ~41.6) likely represents the calm before the holiday storm. Given the high volatility and the potential for a massive spike (like P33 or P35) as dates approach December, a reactive policy relying solely on the recent low means risks stockouts during peak profit opportunities. I will switch to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the broader volatility of the Autumn season (including the 109 and 83 spikes) rather than the recent lull, ensuring safety stock is sufficient for holiday variance. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lull likely ended or deepening: P41 demand (31) is a significant drop from the P37-P40 baseline (~44), possibly signaling a pause before Holiday shopping spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw a massive demand spike to 175 units, breaking the pre-holiday lull and causing a stockout. Period 43 corresponds to Cyber Monday week (Dec 2), suggesting demand will remain elevated, though potentially volatile as it settles from the sheer peak of Period 42. To capture this high-volume, high-variance holiday regime, we switch to a short-memory N=3 estimator. This incorporates the spike (175) and recent baseline (31, 43) to produce a significantly higher mean forecast (~83) and a massive standard deviation estimate, driving the OR backend to set a high base stock (safety stock) to maximize service levels during this critical profit window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Demand Explosion P42: Demand spiked to 175 units (vs P41: 31), confirming the onset of the peak winter holiday season (Black Friday). Volatility is extreme; the pre-holiday lull has definitively ended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $429.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (116) confirms that the holiday high-volume regime is active, sustaining well above the pre-holiday baseline despite dropping from the Black Friday peak (175). With only 2 periods of data in this new regime (P42-P43), relying on earlier 'lull' data (P41: 31) would severely under-forecast. I am using recent_N with N=2 to target the specific characteristics of this active holiday shopping window (Mean ~145.5). The high profit-to-holding cost ratio justifies aggressive stocking to prevent stockouts during this critical seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday high-volume regime confirmed: P42-P43 average 145.5 units (range 116-175), significantly exceeding the pre-holiday baseline (~40). Volatility remains high as the season peaks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 shows a massive drop in demand to 30 units, contrasting sharply with the holiday peaks of P42 (175) and P43 (116). This creates an extremely volatile 3-week window (range 30-175). Despite the drop, it is mid-December (Period 45 is Dec 16), and a pre-Christmas 'last-minute rush' rebound is a high probability risk. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), it is critical to maintain coverage for a potential rebound rather than assuming demand will stay at 30. Current inventory is high (151) due to the P44 unexpected drop. We use recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma to incorporate the high variance of the immediate past (175, 116, 30) into the forecast, ensuring the base stock level protects against another spike while accounting for the recent lull.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility confirmed: P44 demand plummeted to 30 units following the P42-P43 holiday surge (avg 145.5), establishing a highly unstable regime (range 30-175) similar to the Fall oscillation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). We have observed extreme volatility in the last 4 periods (P42=175, P43=116, P44=30, P45=166). The pattern alternates between massive spikes and sudden drops, characteristic of holiday shopping pulses. The most recent observation (P45=166) confirms that demand is still in peak holiday mode, effectively erasing the surplus from the P44 drop. On-hand pipeline is currently very low (3 units) due to the P45 surge. Given the date (Dec 23), this is likely the final major push before post-holiday clearance/returns. A strict recent average (last 4 periods: avg ~122) captures this high-volume regime better than long-term history. The volatility (sigma) is extreme (range 30-175), so we must rely on recent variance. We set parameters to cover this high demand, knowing that January will likely see a drop-off, but under-ordering now risks missing the last high-volume week of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility remains extreme: P45 demand (166) rebounded from P44 lull (30), confirming a jagged high-volume pattern averaging ~122 units/period in December (P42-P45).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to the week of Dec 30. While we anticipate a 'January Slump' reverting toward the historical early-2019 baseline of ~54 units, the current holiday regime (P42-P46) has averaged ~122 units with extreme volatility. Given the 4x penalty for lost sales vs. holding costs, it is safer to bias the forecast on recent high demand (N=5) rather than prematurely cutting inventory to historical lows. This ensures coverage if post-holiday clearance sales are strong, while the holding cost risk is acceptable insurance. L remains 0 as per consistent recent history.

Carry-over insight: Holiday high-volatility regime persists: P46 demand (121) aligns with the P42-P45 average (~122), confirming sustained high volume through late December; however, historical Jan data (~53) signals an imminent downward shift.
