Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Current date (Feb 11) suggests high seasonality for 'Stay Up' tights due to Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Recent demand shows an upward trend (40->50->60) leading into the holiday week. Given the high profit-to-holding ratio ($4 profit/$1 holding, critical fractile 0.8), avoiding stockouts is prioritized. Using all available history (N=5) to establish baseline demand (~50) and volatility (~9) for the base stock calculation, relying on the safety stock buffer to cover potential holiday spikes above the mean. Promised lead time is 0.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18) follows Valentine's (Feb 14); the recent demand peak (60 in Feb 4, 58 in Feb 11) was likely holiday-driven. Now that the event has passed, demand may revert closer to January levels (~40-50). Observed lead time in Period 1 was 0, matching the promise. We utilize the full historical dataset (average ~51 units) via the 'default' method rather than chasing the recent peak, providing a robust buffer that accounts for potential post-holiday softening while maintaining high service for this profitable item (critical ratio 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order 58 arrived P1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 context: Stockout occurred in Period 2 (demand 70 > supply 59). A clear upward demand trend is visible: last 3 periods (Feb 4 to Feb 18) average 62.7, compared to the January average of ~48. To address the stockout and rising demand, we switch mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) to be highly responsive to the new level. We set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the broader volatility (range 40-70) and ensure adequate safety stock for the 80% service level target. Lead time is consistently 0 as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: last 4 periods average 59.5 units, significantly higher than the previous average of 46.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/3/4 (Period 4). The product is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (tights/leggings), which typically sees higher demand in cooler months or around events like Valentine's Day. We are observing stable demand around 60 units/period recently, though Period 3 saw a dip to 42 units. Historical demand suggests volatility. 

Lead Time Analysis: Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived within the same period (lead_time=0 confirmed). No missing shipments detected.

Demand Analysis: Demand history: 58 (P1), 70 (P2), 42 (P3). The average of the last 3 periods is ~56.7. This is slightly lower than the 'Period 3' carry-over insight (59.5), likely due to the drop in P3 demand. Given the volatility (70 -> 42), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most current trends without overreacting to a single point. 

Inventory: On-hand is 31. This is healthy but not enough to cover the expected demand of ~57 units. 

Parameters: 
- L: 'calculate' (observed average is consistently 0).
- mu_hat: 'recent_N' with N=3 to track the local average of ~56.7.
- sigma_hat: 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility (std dev of 58, 70, 42 is ~14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11. Demand for tights appears to be cooling/stabilizing, with the last two periods (42, 44) significantly lower than the Period 2 peak (70). The 4-period average has decreased to 53.5. While the trend suggests lower demand, the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding) necessitates a conservative approach. We treat the recent drop as part of a volatile regime rather than a confirmed permanent shift. Thus, we use a 4-period window to capture both the recent lows and the February highs, ensuring sufficient safety stock if demand rebounds. Lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (March 18) follows a pattern of high demand volatility (Period 5 demand spiked to 69, causing a stockout). The last 5 periods show an average demand of 56.6 units with a standard deviation of ~13.3, significantly higher than pre-game data. Given the Critical Ratio of 0.8 ($4 profit vs $1 holding), we prioritize service level to capture sales peaks like P5. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and variance to exclude the lower, older pre-game data and strictly focus on the active fluctuating regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 (same-period arrival), so 'default' is retained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand spiked to 100 units, the highest observed so far, causing another stockout. The recent demand pattern is volatile (ranging 42-100) with an upward trend in the short term (last 3 periods average 71 units). Lead time remains reliably 0. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), avoiding stockouts is critical. We adopt a responsive N=3 moving average for demand to quickly adapt to the potential seasonal increase, and N=5 for volatility to capture the full recent range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) indicates early spring; while tights demand may eventually soften, recent history shows sustained high volume (avg ~62 over last 7 periods) and significant volatility (spike to 100 in P6). Lead time consistently observed at 0 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (approx 61.8) and sigma_hat (approx 23.8) to capture the recent volatility and protect service levels given the low holding cost ratio, while acknowledging the slight cooling in P7.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: High demand volatility detected (last 5 periods Std Dev ~24, driven by P6 spike to 100); average demand sustains >60.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8) suggests typical spring volatility for legwear. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival confirmed in Period 8 conclude). Demand over the last 5 periods (44, 69, 100, 54, 57) averages ~64.8 with high variance (driven by the P6 outlier of 100). Although P7 and P8 show a stabilization around mid-50s, the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, critical ratio 0.8) justifies maintaining a buffer against potential spikes seen in P2, P5, and P6. We use recent_N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent fluctuation and ensure sufficient safety stock while acknowledging the P7-P8 moderation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is mid-April (Period 10). The product (Tights/Leggings) is seasonally sensitive, and demand in Period 9 dropped to 30 units, the lowest recorded, suggesting the start of a seasonal decline as weather warms. To avoid overstocking during this downtrend, I am switching 'mu_hat' to 'recent_N' with N=3 (avg approx 47 units), which gives more weight to the recent drop than the higher average of the last 5 periods. However, recent volatility has been high (range 30-100 over 5 periods), so I am keeping 'sigma_hat' at 'recent_N' with N=5 to maintain a safety stock buffer against potential demand fluctuations or a brief rebound. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline detected in Period 9 (April 8): demand dropped to 30 (lowest historical) from prior average ~60, consistent with spring warming for Tights category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (late April) confirms the seasonal decline for tights/hosiery detected in Period 9. Demand has dropped consecutively (P9=30, P10=22) significantly below the Q1 average of ~60. I am switching mu_hat to a very responsive short-term average (N=2) to prevent overstocking during this low-demand season. Sigma typically spikes during regime transitions, so I maintain a slightly wider window (N=3) for volatility to ensure adequate service level without excessive holding.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal low demand confirmed: April avg (P9-P10) is 26 units, down ~60% from March levels.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th (Period 12). The SKU (20 denier Tights) is in a confirmed seasonal low period (Spring), with demand dropping significantly from Q1 highs (>60) to an April average of ~29 units. The last 3 periods (P9-P11) consistently show this lower volume (30, 22, 36). 

We select 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to strictly align inventory targets with this new lower seasonal regime. Using a larger N would include high March demand, inflating the forecast and incurring unnecessary holding costs. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival), allowing for a lean inventory strategy.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand stabilization: April demand (P9-P11) averages 29.3 units with lower volatility, confirming the seasonal floor is ~50% of peak winter volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 demand surged to 55 units, significantly exceeding the recent spring average (~29 units observed in P9-P11) and causing a stockout. This spike contradicts the previous trend of stabilization. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), the policy must react to capture potential intermittent demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N=4' (Period 9-12) to integrate this recent spike (demand 55) with the lower spring baseline, raising the safety stock to cover volatility (~14.3 std dev) while keeping the forecast weighted towards valid recent signals.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand instability detected: Period 12 demand spiked to 55, contradicting the prior 'stabilized floor' of ~30 units observed in P9-P11.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (Mid-May). The demand pattern has shifted again. Following a distinct dip in April (avg ~29 units), demand in periods 12 and 13 rebounded significantly (55 and 48 units respectively, avg ~51.5). This suggests the 'seasonal decline' was either temporary or April-specific, and May has higher activity (possibly event-driven for tights). Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the strategy shifts to aggressive recovery. We use `recent_N` (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent uptrend without being dragged down by April's lows, and `recent_N` (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (swing from 22 to 55) in recent history. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May demand rebound confirmed: Periods 12-13 average 51.5 units, significantly above the April low of ~29 units; seasonal decline hypothesis updated to reflect May resurgence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) marks late spring for Tights. After a brief spike in P12-13 (avg ~51), demand crashed back to 22 in P14, mirroring the seasonal lows of April. This invalidates the theory of a sustained 'May rebound' and points instead to high volatility or a return to seasonal decline. Given the high cost of lost sales (CR=0.8), we cannot ignore the recent highs completely. A 4-period moving average captures both the highs (55, 48) and the lows (36, 22), estimating mean demand ~40 with high variance, which sets a safety stock buffer to cover potential spikes while respecting the downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May volatility invalidates sustained rebound: Period 14 demand dropped to 22 units after P12-13 high (~51 avg), indicating high spring volatility rather than a consistent recovery.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (May 27). Demand continues to show extreme volatility in May, bouncing from 22 (P14) back to 54 (P15). The average over the last 4 periods (P12-P15) is ~45 units, which is significantly higher than the April trough (~26 units), contradicting pure seasonal decline expectations. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we prioritize service level. We use recent_N=4 for both mean and variance to capture this specific 'May oscillation' regime, ensuring sufficient safety stock for the high-end spikes (50+) while adapting to the recent unpredictability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May variability persists: Period 15 rebounded to 54 after Period 14's drop to 22. May average (P12-P15) is ~45, distinctly higher than April's ~26, despite approaching summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to June 3 (early Summer). While general category knowledge for 'Tights' suggests a demand decline in summer, current data shows sustained resilience. The 'May Rebound' identified in previous periods has persisted, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging ~44.8 units\u2014significantly higher than the April low (~29 units). Specifically, Period 16 demand (45) aligns perfectly with this recent average. I am therefore maintaining the forecast based on this active regime (N=5) rather than forcing a summer decline that hasn't materialized in the data. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~12), so the safety stock component (via q=0.8) is critical. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: June demand persistence: Entering summer, demand holds steady at 45 units (aligned with May avg ~45), contradicting the expected seasonal drop observed in April; monitoring for delayed summer slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10). Product is 20-denier Stay-Up Tights, a category that typically sees lower demand in summer. However, recent demand data (May-June) remains unexpectedly resilient and volatile. While April (P9-P11) saw a dip to ~29 units, May (P12-P16) rebounded significantly with erratic swings: 55, 48, 22, 54, 45. In Period 17, demand dropped sharply to 20 units. This creates a confusing signal: is P17 the start of the true summer slump, or just another fluctuation like P14? The average observed over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is ~40.6 units, but with extremely high variance (values ranging from 20 to 55). Given the critical cost ratio (0.8, implies z=0.84), understocking is expensive, but holding unsold stock into deep summer is a risk. I will adopt a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture this entire volatile May-June block, averaging ~41 units. This is safer than reacting to the single low point of P17 (20 units) which might be noise, but lower than the full winter average. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump signal: Period 17 demand dropped to 20 units, matching the season-lows seen in April, suggesting the delayed summer decline might finally be setting in.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (June 17). Demand in June (P17: 20, P18: 35) averages 27.5 units, which is ~40% lower than the volatile May average (~46 units). This decline aligns with expected seasonal patterns for tights (garment lower body) as summer approaches. Despite the drop, volatility is high (standard deviation ~15 over last 5 weeks). Lead time remains consistently 0. I am switching mu_hat to `recent_N=3` (avg ~33.3) to capture the recent downward trend without reacting too aggressively to the single low of 20. I retain `recent_N=5` for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the observed instability.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand contraction confirmed: June average (P17-P18) is 27.5 units, significantly below May levels (~46 units), aligning with seasonal expectations for warm-weather apparel.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24) corresponds to deep summer seasonality for Tights/Hosiery. Demand in June (P17-P19) has consistently dropped to a lower regime (averaging 26.7 units) compared to May (averaging ~46 units). The seasonal contraction hypothesis is now strongly supported by 3 consecutive periods of lower demand. To prevent overstocking during this low-demand season while holding costs are significant ($1/unit), I am switching to a short-term moving average (N=3) for both mean and volatility. This focuses the forecast on the current 'summer slump' data points (20, 35, 25) rather than the irrelevant high demand from May. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump confirmed: June demand (P17-P19) stabilizes at avg ~27 units (down ~42% from May), consistent with warm weather patterns for Tights.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 is July 1st, marking 'deep summer' for the Tights category. Period 20 demand dropped to a historical low of 10 units, pulling the June (P17-P20) average down to 22.5 units. This confirms the seasonal slump is fully active. On-hand inventory is 24 units, which covers expected mean demand (~22.5), but volatility remains (Std Dev ~10.4). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to strictly align the forecast with the June low-demand regime, avoiding overstocking while maintaining service for minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer slump intensified: Period 20 demand hit historical low of 10 units. June average (P17-P20) settled at 22.5 units, significantly lower than May levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 is July 8th, firmly in the summer season for Tights. Demand remains low, with Period 21 at 22 units, closely matching the 5-period average (P17-P21) of 22.4 units. The 'summer slump' is now a sustained regime characterized by demand roughly ~35% of winter peaks. Volatility is moderate (std dev ~9 over last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 10, which is below the expected demand of ~22, necessitating replenishment. Given the reliable 0-period lead time, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to tightly reflect this low-volume summer baseline without overreacting to single data points like Period 20's low of 10.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline stabilized: Period 21 demand (22 units) aligns perfectly with the June average (~22.5 units), suggesting a stable summer floor has been reached.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15 (Period 23). We are in the depths of the summer season for tights, characterized by historically low demand compared to winter peaks. Recent demand (last 6 periods, P17-P22) averages 23.5 units, confirming a stable 'summer slump' baseline established in June, though with moderate volatility (range 10-35). The most recent observation (P22: 29 units) is within this low-volume cluster. Operational parameters are set to 'recent_N = 6' to capture this full summer sample (averaging out the P20 dip and P18 spike) while ensuring the base stock covers the 80% critical fractile. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019 (Period 24). We are in the deep summer season for Tights, characterized by a sustained low-demand regime ('Summer Slump') since Period 17 (June start). The last 7 periods (P17-P23) average 23.3 units, significantly down from the winter peak of >60. Period 23 demand (22 units) confirms the stabilization of the summer floor observed in Period 21-22. Lead times remain consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand parameters to encompass the entire summer profile (June & July) to date, balancing low average demand with sufficient safety stock (via sigma) to cover minor volatility (e.g., Period 18's spike to 35). This strategy minimizes holding costs while maintaining service levels during the seasonal trough.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29) is deep summer. Demand for 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (tights) remains at its seasonal trough. Recent demand (P21-P24) averages ~21.8 units, fluctuating between 14 and 29. The most recent period (P24) dropped to 14 units. Given the high holding cost ratio (25% of profit), we must avoid overstocking during this low-sales season. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full scope of the summer slump (including the low of 10 in P20) and prevent the algorithm from overreacting to single-period noise.

Carry-over insight: July Summer Trough Confirmed: Periods 21-24 average ~22 units, with occasional deep dips (e.g., 14 in P24), reinforcing the deep seasonal low for tights forecasted in June.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to August 5th. We are still in the summer season, which has historically shown a lower demand trough (avg ~22 units for P21-P24). However, Period 25 demand spiked to 30 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests summer volatility is increasing, or the 'back-to-school' transition period may be starting early. To react to this risk without overcorrecting for a single data point, I am setting N=5 for both mean and volatility. This window (P21-P25) excludes the extreme low of Period 20 (10 units) and captures the recent localized variance (14 to 30 units), effectively raising the safety stock to prevent further stockouts while maintaining the summer baseline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12 (Period 27). We remain in the deep summer season for tights. Demand in Period 26 was 21 units, aligning closely with the 'Summer Trough' baseline observed since July. The last 6 periods (P21-P26) average 23.0 units with moderate volatility. We maintain a short rolling window (N=6) for both mu and sigma to adhere to this low seasonal baseline, ensuring we do not overstock significantly before the expected autumn demand ramp-up (typically September). Lead times remain consistently 0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 corresponds to August 19. Demand remains in the summer trough (recent 5-period avg ~22.6 units) typical for tights/hosiery, showing no signs of 'Back' to School' or autumn lift yet (P27 demand was 26). I am using recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility to accurately reflect this low-volume summer plateau and filter out the high-volume winter history. A tighter N=5 helps the system react quickly once the inevitable autumn seasonal ramp-up begins. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau persists through mid-August: demand averages ~23.5 units (P26-P27), mirroring July levels with no early autumn spike detected yet.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26 (Period 29), late August. We are observing the very first signs of the transition from the deep summer trough (June/July/early-Aug) towards the Fall season. Demand in Period 28 was 30 units, a slight uptick from the stable ~22-25 summer baseline, though still far below peak winter levels (60+). Since 'Tights' are a highly seasonal Fall/Winter category, we anticipate demand will begin to recover in September/October. The summer trough (P21-P27) averaged roughly 22 units. Period 28's demand of 30 suggests we might be leaving the absolute floor. Given the stockout in P28 (ending inventory 0), service level risk is increasing as volatility rises with the season change. I will increase mu_hat sensitivity to capture this potential upward trend by using a very short memory (recent_3), reflecting the last 3 periods of late-summer data (avg ~25.6), while maintaining a standard deviation buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer pivot detected: Period 28 demand rose to 30 units (vs Jul/Aug avg ~23), signaling potential start of pre-fall recovery for Tights category.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September 2nd marks the clear transition from summer to autumn for tights. The 'Late-summer pivot' detected in Period 29 (30 units) was sustained by Period 29 demand (29 units) and earlier Period 28 demand (30 units). We have now seen three consecutive periods of demand ~30 units (P25:30, P28:30, P29:29), distinctly above the mid-summer low of ~22. As school starts and temperatures drop, demand will likely climb further towards the 40-50 range seen in spring. The current on-hand inventory is critically low (3 units). To prepare for the autumn ramp-up and avoid stockouts as demand accelerates, I will increase the forecast basis to reflect this emerging autumn recovery trend rather than the deep summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Late August/Early Sept demand stabilizes ~30 units (P28-P29), up ~35% from July lows, signaling start of seasonal ascent.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September 9th (Period 31) marks the continuation of the Early Autumn season. Demand has stabilized at a higher plateau (~30 units) compared to the summer trough (~22 units), confirming the seasonal recovery for Tights. Last 3 periods (P28-P30) averaged 30 units with very low volatility (Std Dev ~1), but relying on this recent low volatility is risky during a seasonal transition where spikes are likely (historical spring transition showed Std Dev ~15). Therefore, I use 'recent_N=3' for mu_hat to capture the current demand step-up without dragging in summer lows, but switch 'sigma_hat' to 'default' to utilize the broader historical volatility. This ensures a larger safety stock to permit service levels of ~84% against potential seasonal surges, which is critical given we ended Period 30 with 0 inventory.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn demand stabilization: Periods 28-30 average 30.0 units, consistently distinct from the summer trough (~22 units), confirming the seasonal upward trend foundation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Mid-September) confirms the onset of the Fall/Winter high season for Tights. Period 31 demand surged to 64 units, doubling the prior average of ~30, and causing a stockout. This spike aligns with historical winter demand levels (average ~60 in Feb/Mar). Standard moving averages (N>=3) lag significantly (forecasting ~41), which would likely cause repeated stockouts given the 0.8 critical ratio (cost of understock >> cost of holding). Therefore, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast of 58 units (matching P1/P31 levels) to immediately adjust to the new regime. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with the transition.

Carry-over insight: Major seasonal demand spike confirmed: Period 31 demand (64 units) doubled the prior average, signaling the full onset of the Fall/Winter high season (historical avg ~60).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand (P30-P32) shows high volatility (31, 64, 39) with a rising average (~45) compared to summer. The P31 spike to 64 signals the onset of the high season (Autumn/Winter). We use recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this rapid upward shift and increased volatility, ensuring we build inventory for the expected seasonal peak (historical ~60+).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal ascent volatility confirmed: Sept demand fluctuates wildly (31 -> 64 -> 39), averaging ~45 units, indicating the transition from summer lows to winter highs is unstable but trending upward.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sept 30) confirms we have entered the high-demand Fall/Winter season. Period 33 demand surged to 93 units, causing a complete stockout (lost sales) and rivaling the historical peak of 100 set in March. Demand has shifted gears rapidly: the average of the last 3 periods (P31-P33) is ~65 units, compared to the summer baseline of ~22. Given the extreme volatility in the ascent (39 in P32 vs 93 in P33), I am switching to a very responsive N=3 baseline for both mu and sigma to capture this new high-volume regime immediately and prevent further lost profits during this high-margin season.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal velocity confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 93 units, pushing the trailing 3-period average to ~65 units (up from the previously noted ~45 trend).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 corresponds to early October, a peak season for Tights. Demand in September (Periods 31-34) has established a new high-velocity regime, averaging 66 units per period with significant volatility (spanning 39 to 93 units). This is a drastic shift from the summer average (~22 units). To prevent stockouts during this high-margin season, I am setting forecasting parameters to 'recent_N' with N=4. This focuses the estimator entirely on the active Autumn regime (Sept 9 - Sept 30), discarding irrelevant summer data. Lead time remains consistently observed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand plateau confirmed: Period 34 demand (68 units) sustains the high Sept average (~66 units), validating the shift from summer lows to the winter peak season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Oct 14): We are deep in the Autumn ascent. Demand in Period 35 was 80 units, following a volatile climb (64->39->93->68->80). The 5-period average (P31-P35) is ~69 units, with a very high recent peak of 93. This confirms the strong seasonal resurgence for Tights. Volatility is high (sigma ~20 units), requiring a safety buffer. Actual lead time remains 0 periods consistently. I will increase mu_hat to reflect the robust recent demand (using recent_5 average ~69) and maintain a reactive sigma to cover the 90+ spikes seen in P33. The goal is to maximize availability for the peak season while managing the zero-lead-time replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: Period 35 demand (80 units) reinforces the high-volume trend (avg ~69 units P31-P35), surpassing the early-Sept volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21) places us well into the Fall/Winter peak season for Tights. Demand has stabilized at high volumes, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging 70.2 units per period, a substantial increase from the summer low of ~22 units. Recently observed demand in P36 (71) and P35 (80) confirms the high-volume regime. The most recent demand (71) is very close to the average of the last 6 periods (~69). We are in a consistent high-demand autumnal plateau. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maximize service levels during this peak season while managing the holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit, so critical fractile ~0.8), I will set mu_hat to capture the recent high volume using a short window (recent_N=6) to stay responsive to peak volatility, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the increased variance of the high season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand stabilization confirmed: Oct demand (P35-P36) averages 75.5 units, sustaining the high-volume regime established in September (avg ~69); peak season pattern fully active.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (Oct 28) represents the heart of the autumn/winter season for tights. Demand has surged to a record high of 102 units in Period 37, causing another stockout. The trailing 5-period average (P33-P37) is now ~83 units, driven by the volatility of the seasonal peak (ranging from 68 to 102). Lead time remains reliably 0. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this high-demand, high-variance regime and ensure sufficient safety stock against the aggressive seasonal consumption.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Peak season intensity surges: Period 37 demand hit a record 102 units, pushing the 3-week October average to ~84 units; stockouts persist due to rapid demand velocity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High-demand peak season intensity continues. Current date is Nov 4 (Period 39). Demand in Period 38 was 107 units, the highest recorded so far, outpacing even the previous record of 102 in Period 37. The last 3 periods (P36-P38) average 93.3 units, significantly above the September average. Volatility remains high (recent demands: 71, 102, 107). Stockouts have occurred in 4 of the last 6 periods (P33, P34, P35, P37, P38 stockout), indicating the base stock is consistently underestimating the velocity of the seasonal ascent. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the consistent upward trend and repeated stockouts, I will use a short-term average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the immediate high velocity (~93 units), and explicit high sigma to buffer against the aggressive volatility (std dev of last 5 is ~14, but recent jumps suggest higher safety stock is needed).

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal velocity confirmed: Nov demand (P38) hit 107 units, establishing a new high-volume baseline (~93 avg last 3 weeks) well above October levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (mid-November) confirms the peak seasonal intensity for Tights. Demand in Period 39 (97 units) remains consistent with the high levels seen in P37 (102) and P38 (107). The 3-period trailing average (P37-P39) is ~102 units, significantly higher than the early October average. Given the sustained high volume and the risk of stockouts during the holiday buildup, we use a tight recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture the current velocity (~102 units). For volatility, we use recent_N=5 (approx. std dev ~15) to account for the fluctuations seen during the ascent phase (71 to 107 units). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak season plateau confirmed: November demand (P37-P39) sustains a high-volume average of ~102 units, stabilizing after the rapid October ascent, confirming full holiday season velocity.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (mid-November) confirms the winter peak season is in full effect. Demand in Period 40 (70 units) dipped slightly below the recent extreme highs (97-107 units in P38-39), but the trend remains elevated compared to early October. The rolling 4-period average (P37-40) is ~94 units. Given the high volatility and stockouts in P37/P38, maintaining a high service level is critical. The dip to 70 in P40 might be noise or a brief respite; I will stick to a robust estimator (recent_N=4) to capture the high-volume active plateau while smoothing out single-week fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early November demand dip observed: Period 40 demand (70) dropped 30% from the P38-39 peak (~102), potentially signaling a mid-month lull before Black Friday/December spikes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 corresponds to the week of Nov 25th (Black Friday), traditionally a peak sales period for Tights. Demand in Period 41 rebounded to 92 units after a dip in Period 40, bringing the 5-period average to ~94 units. This recovery confirms the dominance of the high-volume Winter/Holiday regime (range 70-107). To maximize service level for the high-margin Item ($4 profit/$1 hold) during this critical week, we use `recent_N=5` for demand and volatility. This configuration captures the high average (~94) regarding the rebound, while the inclusion of the recent variance (std dev ~14.5) ensures safety stock is sufficient to cover potential Black Friday spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand resilience confirmed: Period 41 rebounded to 92 units (from Period 40 dip), re-establishing the high-volume baseline (avg ~94 units over P37-P41) entering Black Friday week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 corresponds to December 2nd (Cyber Monday week). Period 42 (Black Friday week) demand exploded to 159 units, a historical record (+73% over the prior 4-week average), causing an immediate stockout. With on-hand inventory at 0 and entering the peak holiday gifting weeks (early/mid-December), the cost of lost sales (Profit=$4) far outweighs holding risk ($1). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging ~107 units) to capture this elevated holiday baseline and the extreme volatility introduced by the Black Friday surge, ensuring aggressive replenishment to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday Super-Spike confirmed: Period 42 demand hit 159 units, shattering previous records (typical peak ~100). This drastic +73% jump over the recent trend caused a stockout and established a new extreme for holiday volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 corresponds to December 9th. We have observed a normalization in demand to 85 units in Period 43, down from the massive Black Friday spike of 159 in Period 42. This level (85) is consistent with the pre-Black Friday high-season plateau (Oct/Nov avg ~95). Given the extremely high volatility (StDev ~40 over last 4 weeks) and the remaining pre-Christmas shopping window, we must maintain high safety stock. We utilize recent_N = 4 for both mu and sigma to incorporate the high holiday volume and the Black Friday variance into the forecast, ensuring robust coverage for potential December surges while acknowledging the post-promo dip.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday normalization confirmed: Period 43 demand dropped to 85 units (-46% from P42), returning to the steady high-volume holiday baseline established in late Oct/early Nov.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the peak pre-Christmas shopping week. Period 44 demand (132 units) rebounded significantly from the post-Black Friday dip (85 units) in Period 43, confirming that the holiday high-velocity regime is still active. Volatility remains extreme (159 -> 85 -> 132). To minimize stockout risk during this critical profit week (Cost ratio 4:1), we utilize recent_N=3 for both mean and volatility to capture the immediate high-volume trend average (~125 units) and the significant variance (~30 units) of the last 3 weeks. Promised lead time of 0 remains reliable.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December demand surge confirmed: Period 44 demand (132 units) rebounded strongly from the post-Black Friday dip (85), signaling intense pre-Christmas shopping velocity significantly above the October/early-Nov baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 begins on Dec 23rd, covering Christmas week. Period 45 (last week) set a new historical demand record of 177 units, causing a stockout and confirming intense pre-holiday velocity. While demand is expected to remain high due to winter weather and immediate holiday needs, a slight deceleration is possible post-December 25th. Given the extreme recent volatility (from 85 to 177 in 3 weeks), a short memory (N=3) is selected for forecasting to capture the high-volume baseline (~131 avg) and high variance without over-anchoring on the single P45 spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak crescendo: Period 45 demand reached all-time high of 177 units, surpassing Black Friday, driven by final pre-Christmas shopping week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (Dec 30) marks the immediate post-holiday transition. Historical data provided for Jan 2019 (avg ~50 units) and the drop in Period 46 (from 177 to 132) suggest a sharp correction from gift-giving peaks back to varying winter baseline levels. While winter demand for tights remains relevant, the 'frenzy' volume is over. We set mu_hat explicitly to 65 to bridge the gap between the recent high of 132 and the historical Jan average of ~50-58, anticipating a continued decline. We retain recent_N=5 for sigma to capture the residual high volatility of the season, ensuring a safety buffer if the drop is slower than expected.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization confirmed: Period 46 demand (132 units) dropped 25% from the Period 45 peak (177), signaling the end of the extreme gift-giving surge and a reversion toward standard winter velocity.
