Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start (2019-02-11). The product is 'Jersey Basic' leggings. Historical data provided shows stable demand in Jan/Feb 2019 (ranges 85-113, avg ~103). No prior order history exists, so we rely on the provided 5 data points. The date is mid-February, standard retail period for basics. Promised lead time is 0. Since we have no observation of lead time yet, I will stick to the default promised lead time (0 periods). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' which calculates the mean and std dev of all available historical samples (the 5 provided). This is a safe starting policy until more data is observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 resulted in a stockout (125 demand > 113 on-hand), indicating that the pre-game average (~103) led to under-stocking. Demand has been trending upward recently (112 in pre-game period 0, 125 in period 1) compared to the dip two weeks ago (85). To prevent further unexpected stockouts and capture this higher demand level, I am switching mu_hat to a responsive 'recent_N' with N=2 (averaging ~118.5). I am keeping sigma_hat at 'default' (full history) to maintain a stable safety stock buffer (~13.5) based on overall volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25). We have observed consecutive stockouts in Period 1 and Period 2. Demand has shown a significant upward trend (125 in P1, 199 in P2) compared to the January historical average of ~103. The most recent demand (199) is nearly double the historical mean, suggesting a regime shift or seasonal spike for leggings in late February. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival). To mitigate stockouts and capture this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to use the most recent 3 data points, allowing the system to react to the recent surge without completely discarding the prior period's stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Feb avg ~162 (last 2 periods) vs Jan avg ~103 (+57%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $515.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (Mar 4). Demand data supports the high-demand regime identified in Period 3, though slightly stabilized (last 3 periods: 125, 199, 140; avg ~155). This is +50% vs Jan averages. Actual lead time consistently 0 periods. Given the high profit/holding ratio (0.8), avoiding stockouts is critical. I am using recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma to align the base stock with the recent high mean and volatility (standard deviation ~39), ignoring the lower-demand January history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $262.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 demand (90) dropped sharply back to January baseline levels, suggesting the February spike (avg ~155) has ended. Because stockout cost ($4) exceeds holding cost ($1), a conservative transition is preferred over a reactive drop. Configuring recent_N=5 for mu and sigma incorporates the recent low (90), the volatility of Feb, and the pre-spike baseline to smooth the forecast (approx mean ~133) and maintain adequate safety stock against potential rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Feb demand spike appears ended; Period 4 demand (90) returned to Jan baseline levels (~103).

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (Mid-March) signals a seasonal transition away from winter wear (Long Leggings). Demand has plummeted from the Feb peak (199) down to 56 in Period 5, which is ~50% of the Jan baseline. The trend is strongly negative. I am using recent_N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this downward adjustment while retaining enough variance to hold a safety stock (Critical Fractile 0.8 supports higher service levels). Current inventory (112) is healthy, but the N=3 parameters suggest a small top-up might be calculated by the backend to insure against demand rebounding slightly.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline intensifies: Period 5 demand (56) dropped ~45% below Jan baseline (~103), signaling rapid end-of-season for Long Leggings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (Mar 25). Observed Period 6 demand (99) recovered significantly from the Period 5 low (56), returning to levels seen in Period 4 (90) and the Jan baseline. This suggests the previous 'rapid seasonal decline' insight was premature or driven by single-period volatility. March demand (Periods 4-6) is characterized by a lower average (~82) compared to February, but high variance (Std Dev ~23). We switch to N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to model this specific 'volatile Spring' regime, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover a recurrence of ~99 demand while reacting to the lower average of 82. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: March demand regime confirmed: Avg ~82 (Periods 4-6) is significantly lower than Feb peak (~155) but highly volatile (range 56-99), requiring robust safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand did not crash as expected; late March demand (Periods 6-7: 99, 112) rebounded significantly from Period 5 lows. Current regime (last 3 periods) averages ~89 with high volatility. Using recent_N=3 for mu/sigma to capture this spring transition variability.

Carry-over insight: March demand stabilized around ~89 units (avg Periods 4-7), contradicting the "rapid end-of-season" hypothesis from Period 6. Volatility remains high (56-112).

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8). Demand has rebounded significantly over the last three periods (P6:99, P7:112, P8:128), averaging 113, which is well above the early March lows (approx 89). The Period 8 demand of 128 exceeded available inventory (114), causing lost sales. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio of 4:1, understocking is costly. I am switching to a shorter memory for the demand mean (N=3) to capture this rising trend (approx 113), while keeping a slightly longer memory for volatility (N=5) to account for the risk of dips like Period 5. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound P6-P8: Avg 113 (trend 99->112->128), clearly breaking the earlier March low/stable pattern.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April). Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods. Demand pattern analysis: The upward trend observed in Periods 6-8 (99->112->128) was interrupted by Period 9 (89). However, the average of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 107 units, which aligns almost perfectly with the pre-game January baseline (~103 units). This suggests the product has exited the Feb peak/Mar dip volatility and returned to a stable baseline regime. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability window (P6-P9) while excluding the outlier low in Period 5 (56). This provides a forecast of ~107 units with moderate volatility buffering.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed: P6-P9 average demand (107) has returned to pre-seasonal Jan baseline levels (~103), signaling the end of the Feb peak and Mar trough volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (Late April) indicates potential seasonal tapering for 'Long Leggings' as weather warms. Demand in the last two periods (P9: 89, P10: 87) has settled below the January/recouped baseline of ~103. However, given the high service level target (q=0.8) and recent volatility (P7: 112, P8: 128), I am using a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for forecast parameters. This yields a mean demand of ~103 and standard deviation of ~17, providing a slight buffer over the immediate short-term trend (avg ~88) to protect against random spikes like Period 8. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal tapering detected: demand in Periods 9-10 (avg 88) has tightened and dropped ~15% below the Jan/March baseline (~103), likely due to warmer late-April weather reducing demand for Long Leggings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $457.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Apr 29 suggests spring/summer transition. While P9-P10 showed tapering (~88), P11 spiked to 115, invalidating a smooth decline. The 3-period average is ~97, consistent with baselines but volatile. With only 3 units on hand, we must cover the full mean demand plus safety stock. We switch to recent_N=3 for both mean and sigma to capture this specific late-April volatility (89, 87, 115) without dragging in older high-season data.

Carry-over insight: Spring volatility persists: Demand avg ~97 (Periods 9-11) remains steady rather than declining, with high periodic variance (87 to 115 spike in P11) contradicting smooth seasonal tapering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: May 6. Demand for Long Leggings is stabilizing as spring progresses. The last 4 periods (April) show an average demand of ~97 units with moderate volatility. This is lower than the January baseline (~103) and the February peak, aligning with expected seasonal decline. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this specific spring regime (P9-P12) and filter out earlier noise. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed: April/May transition demand (Periods 9-12) has settled at avg ~97 with reduced volatility, distinct from the higher winter baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 corresponds to mid-May, and demand for Long Leggings is showing a clear seasonal decline as warmer weather sets in. The last 3 periods show a sharp downward trend (115 -> 97 -> 79). While P11 was a spike, the drop to 79 in P13 is the lowest demand since the outlier in P5. I am using a short 5-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat (Period 9-13 average ~93.4) to capture this downward transition without over-reacting to the single low point in P13. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May seasonal decline confirmed: Demand trending down (115->97->79) in last 3 periods, with P13 (79) marking a significant drop consistent with late-spring reduced usage of Long Leggings.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) sees inventory at critical levels (1 unit). While Period 13 suggested a seasonal drop (79), Period 14 (104) rebounded strongly, indicating that while a general seasonal tapering is likely occurring (April avg ~105 vs May avg ~91), the decline is highly volatile rather than smooth. A demand of 104 is still very possible. Relying on the steep decline theory is risky given the high stocking cost of stockouts (Crit Ratio 0.8). Choosing recent_N=5 (covering mid-April to present) captures the full range of recent volatility (79-115) and maintains a base stock around ~110 to protect service levels against another 100+ demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Volatility dominates May trend: Period 14 demand (104) rebounded significantly from Period 13 (79), contradicting the smooth seasonal decline hypothesis. Recent average (~96) remains robust despite calendar date.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (late May) shows a massive demand spike to 145 in Period 15, the highest since February, causing a stockout (109 available, 36 lost sales) and completely overturning the 'seasonal decline' hypothesis. The recent trend (79 -> 104 -> 145) exhibits extreme volatility and upward momentum, potentially driven by end-of-season clearance behavior. Given the high penalty for lost sales (Profit ratio ~0.8), we shift to a highly responsive N=3 parameter set. This captures the recent high variance to boost safety stock and recover inventory levels immediately. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Late-spring volatility explosion: Period 15 demand (145) shattered the seasonal decline trend, creating a stockout. The active regime is now defined by extreme fluctuation (P13-P15 range: 79-145), requiring aggressive safety stock buffering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to early June. Demand in Period 16 (109) stabilized after the extreme outlier in Period 15 (145), yet remains significantly above the Period 13 low (79). The 'seasonal decline' hypothesis for summer is currently contradicted by this robust recent average (P13-P16 avg ~109). Given the high profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), the cost of stockouts is dominant. I am using recent_N=4 for both demand and volatility to capture the full extent of the recent turbulence (ranging from 79 to 145) without over-indexing on the single massive spike in Period 15. This provides a base stock covering the recent average plus a safety buffer for the high observed variance.

Carry-over insight: June resilience: Demand stabilized at 109 in Period 16, maintaining levels well above the early May low (79) and suggesting the expected summer decline is delayed or milder than anticipated.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) status check: Demand in Period 17 dropped sharply to 63, the lowest point since Period 5 (56 units). This 42% drop from the prior period (109) and the general decline from the mid-May spike (145) strongly suggests the start of the deep summer trough for Long Leggings. The recent 5-period trend is highly volatile (79 -> 104 -> 145 -> 109 -> 63), averaging ~100 but with a downward vector. We must balance the risk of another random spike (like P15's 145) against the likely seasonal decline. Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1) favors service (80% critical ratio), we maintain a buffer but align the forecast downwards. We switch to a recent_N=3 approach for mean (avg of P15-P17: (145+109+63)/3 = 105.6) to capture the mix of volatility and decline, rather than reacting solely to the single low point of 63. Sigma remains elevated to cover the massive observed variance (last 5 periods range 63-145). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal trough initiation: Period 17 demand (63) dropped ~42% from P16 and is near historical lows, signaling potential onset of low-demand summer season for Long Leggings.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17 (Period 19). June demand (Periods 17-18) averages ~75 units, a clear step down from the May average of ~119, confirming the onset of the summer seasonal trough for long leggings. However, Period 18 (86) rebounded from the Period 17 low (63), indicating the floor may not be as low as initially feared. Given the high cost of lost sales (ratio 0.8), we select N=3 for the mean (avg ~86) to capture the declining trend without over-correcting to the single low of 63. We use N=5 for sigma to retain memory of the high recent volatility (range 63-145) in the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline establishing: June avg demand (P17-P18: ~75) is ~37% below late Spring levels (P14-P16: ~119), confirming seasonal decline, though P18 (86) indicates moderate resilience vs the P17 low (63).

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 demand (121) surged significantly (+40%) from Period 18, causing a stockout and contradicting the previous hypothesis of a 'summer trough' decline. The dataset for late May/June shows extreme volatility (Periods 15-19: 145, 109, 63, 86, 121), with an average of ~105. This indicates that while the season suggests lower demand, actual consumption remains robust and unpredictable (likely due to year-round athletic use). We switch to a recent_N=5 strategy to capture this high-volatility regime and the higher baseline average (~105) compared to the localized dip seen in Pr17-18. This approach ensures sufficient buffer stock to cover recurrence of spikes >120 units.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility replaces decline hypothesis: June demand (P17-P19: 63->86->121) exhibits extreme fluctuation rather than a steady seasonal drop, with P19's surge invalidating the 'summer trough' baseline of ~75 established in P18.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st) marks the start of deep summer. Period 20 demand dropped to a historical low of 49 units, consistent with the expected seasonal trough for 'Long Leggings'. However, the immediately preceding Period 19 saw a massive spike to 121, creating extreme local volatility (June range: 49-121). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we cannot rely solely on the Period 20 low. We use recent_N=4 for both mean and volatility to capture the full June variance (avg ~80, high sigma), ensuring safety stock covers potential rebounds while respecting the seasonal downward trend indicated by Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer trough indicated: Period 20 demand (49) established a new historical low consistent with July seasonality, though extreme volatility persists (P19 spike to 121 vs P20 drop to 49) necessitating wider safety stock buffers.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) confirms high summer volatility for Long Leggings. While the seasonal average (approx 80) is lower than winter, the variance is extreme (recent observations: 63, 86, 121, 49, 82). I am strictly using decent history (N=5) to capture this fluctuating regime (P17-P21) rather than assuming a smooth decline. This sets a base stock that covers the average (~80) plus a volatility buffer for spikes like P19.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility confirmed: July/June demand (avg ~80) is highly erratic (range 49-121), preventing a stable low-demand seasonal baseline; high safety stock required despite "off-season" status.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 represents deep summer (mid-July), where demand for Long Leggings is traditionally lowest. While the most recent demand (66) fits the low-demand thesis, the product exhibits high volatility (ranges from 49 to 121 in the last 5 periods). Since profit margins ($4) significantly outweigh holding costs ($1), avoiding stockouts during random spikes (like Period 19's 121 units) is the priority. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full recent 'summer' distribution, including the high spike in P19 and the deep trough in P20. This maintains a higher safety stock than a shorter horizon (N=3) would, protecting against the observed erratic demand patterns. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer decline: Average demand dropped to ~66 (last 3 periods) from ~90 (prev 3), confirming a lower July baseline compared to June despite persistent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22). July demand has stabilized in the last 3 periods (P21-P23: 82, 66, 80), averaging 76 units. This contradicts the hypothesis of a continued decline to ~66 suggested in Period 23; the Period 20 drop to 49 appears to be the outlier floor, while the Period 19 spike to 121 remains the ceiling. With on-hand inventory critically low at 24 units, and a high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a stockout is the primary risk. I am setting mu_hat using the recent 3-period stabilized average (N=3) to track the current July plateau. However, I am setting sigma_hat with a wider window (N=7) to encompass the full summer volatility (including the P19/P20 extremes), ensuring the calculated safety stock is robust enough to cover potential fluctuations despite the recent stability. Lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: July stabilization: Demand in Periods 21-23 averaged 76 units (range 66-82), correcting the Period 23 'deep decline' signal and indicating a stable summer plateau rather than a continued drop.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: July 29 (Summer). Demand has stabilized in July (Periods 21-24) with an average of ~75 units, confirming the 'Summer Plateau' trend identified in the previous period. This is significantly lower than the Spring baseline (~100+) but relatively stable compared to the volatility of May/June. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods with no missing shipments. I am selecting recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full summer regime (Periods 20-24), which includes the dip to 49 and the recovery to ~80, ensuring the forecast reflects both the lower seasonal mean (~70) and the residual variance.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5 (Peak Summer). Demand for Long Leggings has stabilized over the last 5 periods (July) in a 'Summer Trough', averaging ~73 units with relatively low volatility (range 66-82). This consistent low-demand pattern (typical for the season) has persisted for over a month, distinct from the volatility seen in June. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this stable July baseline. The observed lead time remains reliable at 0 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Aug 12 (Period 27). We are deep in the off-season for Long Leggings. Recent demand (P21-P26) has stabilized at a low baseline, averaging ~70.5 units (range 58-82), significantly below the winter peaks (>140). The last 3 periods (P24-P26: 71, 66, 58) show a continued gentle decline as August progresses, likely reaching the annual trough before Autumn demand picks up. The volatility observed in June/July (spikes to 121) has subsided; the last 4 weeks have been remarkably stable (80, 71, 66, 58). I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 (covering the stabilized July/Aug period) to capture this low baseline accurately. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility (std dev ~8.5 in last 6 periods vs ~26 overall), preventing overstocking during the low season. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed: July/Aug demand (P21-P26) averages ~70.5 with declining volatility, marking the seasonal trough for Long Leggings.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 corresponds to August 19th. We are deep in the summer season, which is the historical trough for Long Leggings. The last 5 periods show a consistent, smooth downward trend (80 -> 71 -> 66 -> 58 -> 52), with volatility significantly reduced compared to June/July. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~59 units. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), and the established declining trend, we adopt a lean inventory posture. We use 'recent_N=3' for mu_hat to tightly track the declining mean (~59) and 'recent_N=5' for sigma_hat to capture the reduced volatility of the late summer period. No lead time issues observed.

Carry-over insight: Late summer trough deepens: August demand (avg ~55 in P26-P27) has dropped further below July levels (~71), establishing a new seasonal low with minimal volatility, confirming the end of the erratic mid-summer phase.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) confirms the deep seasonal trough for Long Leggings, with demand hitting a new yearly low of 50 units in Period 28. The last 4 periods (P25-P28) show a steady, low-volume decline (66 -> 58 -> 52 -> 50) with reduced volatility compared to early summer. We set mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=4) to align with this established low baseline (~56.5 avg) while avoiding over-reaction to the single lowest point. We similarly use 'recent_N' (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the tightening variance while retaining a modest buffer against potential early-fall fluctuations. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: August trough stabilization: Demand has bottomed out at a yearly low (avg ~53 for P26-P28), with low volatility, confirming late-summer minimal usage before the Fall season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (Sep 2) marks the transition from Summer to Fall and includes the Labor Day retail weekend. While August demand bottomed out at a stable ~52 units (Periods 26-29), continuing to forecast using only this trough data risks stockouts as leggings demand typically correlates with cooler weather (Back-to-School/Fall). I am therefore extending the estimation window to N=8 (incorporating mid-July data) to raise the baseline forecast (from ~52 to ~61) and capture higher volatility (Sigma increases from ~4 to ~10). This creates a necessary inventory buffer for the seasonal upturn.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (65) shows a clear break from the August trough (avg ~50), confirming the start of the Autumn demand recovery for Long Leggings. Given the seasonal nature of the product and the date (Sep 9), I anticipate demand to continue rising. I am switching 'mu_hat' to use the most recent 3 periods to react quickly to this upward trend, rather than averaging in the low summer data. I will keep 'sigma_hat' responsive as well (recent 3) to account for increasing volatility as sales volume grows. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal transition confirmed: Period 30 demand (65) jumped ~30% from the August trough baseline (~50), signaling the start of the Autumn season recovery for Long Leggings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Mid-September). The previous assumption of a smooth seasonal transition was challenged by Period 31 demand dropping to 43, immediately following the Period 30 spike to 65. This indicates a volatile transition phase rather than a consistent upward trend. We switch to a short-term focus (N=3) for parameter estimation. This captures the high recent variance (range 43-65) to boost the safety stock buffer (via sigma) while keeping the mean centered on the actual recent activity (~52) rather than historical winter highs. This balances the risk of another spike against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Transition volatility: Period 31 demand (43) reversed the Period 30 spike (65), dropping below the summer average (~53). The seasonal recovery is erratic, characterized by high volatility (43-65) rather than steady growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 demand (97) exploded (+125% vs P31), confirming the aggressive onset of the Autumn season and causing a stockout. This spike invalidates the summer baseline (~55) and indicates a high-volatility transition regime (range 43-97). To instantly adapt to this new level and prevent further lost sales (Profit/Holding ratio suggests 80% service level), I am switching to a highly reactive N=2 setting. This captures the rapid mean shift (~70) and the extreme recent volatility (sigma ~38 from samples 43, 97), pushing the base stock target to ~102 units to cover the new demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand explosion: Period 32 demand (97) spiked +125% vs Period 31 (43), causing stockout. Regime is now high-demand (Autumn) with extreme volatility, requiring rapid upward parameter adjustment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 34 (Sep 30) confirms the Autumn seasonal surge introduced in Period 33. Demand rose from 97 (P32) to 121 (P33), confirming a high-demand regime significantly above the Summer baseline (~53). The rapid ascent caused two consecutive stockouts. Given the steep upward trajectory (trend: 43->97->121), utilizing a short memory (N=2) for the demand mean (approx 109) is crucial to chase the trend, while a slightly longer window (N=3) for volatility captures the inherent instability of the seasonal transition (sigma approx 33). These parameters set a target base stock around 137 units (109 mean + buffer), aiming to recover service levels and cover potential demand growth towards 130+ units.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up reinforced: Two consecutive periods of high demand (97, 121; avg 109) confirm the exit from the summer trough. The trajectory (25% increase P32 to P33) indicates approaching winter peak levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 corresponds to early October, firmly in the Autumn season for Long Leggings. Demand in Period 34 (98 units) remained high, consistent with the Autumn shift detected in Periods 32-33 (97, 121). The last 3 periods average ~105 units, nearly double the summer baseline (~53). Given the current on-hand inventory of 45 is well below one period of demand, and prior stockouts in P32/P33, immediate replenishment is critical. We adopt a short memory (N=3) for mu_hat to align quickly with the new ~105 unit baseline, and a slightly longer memory (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility of the seasonal transition (range 43-121) and buffer against variance. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime established: Demand P32-P34 avg ~105, distinct from summer (~53), stabilizing at ~2x previous levels despite volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-October (Period 36, 2019/10/14). The product is Long Leggings, a seasonal item where demand rises in Autumn/Winter. 

Recent context:
- **Seasonality:** Summer trough (avg ~53) ended in early September.
- **Recent Demand:** Periods 32-35 showed a sharp increase and significant volatility (97, 121, 98, 62). The average for the last 4 periods is ~94.5.
- **Volatility:** Period 35's dip to 62 adds noise, but the overall trend since mid-September is upwards from the summer baseline. The dip might be a short-term fluctuation or a reaction to a specific weather event, but the underlying season is Autumn.
- **Stock Status:** On-hand is 70, with no in-transit. Service level is critical as we enter peak season.

Strategy:
- **Lead Time (L):** Observed lead times remain consistently 0. We stick to default (promised 0).
- **Demand Forecast (mu_hat):** The Summer baseline is obsolete. The recent 'Autumn Ramp-up' regime (Periods 32-35) averages ~94.5. Given the dip in P35, a pure recent average is safer than an explicit aggression. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the entire post-trough transition (P32-P35).
- **Volatility (sigma_hat):** Variance is extremely high in this transition (62 to 121). Standard deviation of last 4 periods is ~25. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to ensure the safety stock reflects this specific transition turbulence.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility confirmed: Period 35 demand (62) dropped significantly from the Period 33 peak (121), showing that the seasonal ramp-up is non-linear and highly erratic (avg ~95, range 62-121).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Oct 21 implies active autumn season for Long Leggings, despite a surprising demand drop in periods 35-36 (avg ~60) following the initial seasonal spike (avg ~105). Using recent_N=5 (Periods 32-36) for demand and volatility captures both the high peaks and recent lows (Avg ~87), ensuring safety stock accounts for the extreme volatility (range 57-121) observed during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Autumn volatility persists: Demand fell back to summer levels in P35-P36 (avg ~60), contradicting the strong seasonal ramp-up seen in P32-P34 (avg ~105). This erratic oscillation (121 -> 57) defines the current regime, requiring parameters that average the full transition window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Oct 28 (Period 38). Context: We are in late Autumn, historically a ramp-up period for Long Leggings, but recent data shows a surprising 'Oct Lull'. Observation: While September (P32-34) showed a strong seasonal start (avg ~105), October (P35-P37) has dropped and stabilized at a much lower level (avg ~61), dangerously close to summer lows. Strategy: Despite the recent lull, using a short memory (N=3) would set base stock too low (~60) right before November, risking stockouts if winter demand abruptly resumes (historically >100). Therefore, I selected 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mean and volatility. This bridges the Sept spike and Oct lull (avg ~83, higher sigma), providing a safety buffer that respects the volatility of the seasonal transition while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: October lull confirmed: Demand stabilized in Periods 35-37 (avg 61) significantly below the September seasonal spike (avg 105), creating a bimodal Autumn profile (Sept high vs Oct low) rather than steady linear growth.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4. October demand (P35-38 avg ~61) was surprisingly low compared to September (peaks of 121), creating a false sense of security before the core Winter season. To prepare for the expected November/December ramp-up (historical Jan data ~110+), I am expanding the estimation window to N=8. This incorporates the high-demand volatility of September into the base stock calculation, raising the target significantly above the recent lull to prevent stockouts as cold weather intensifies.

Carry-over insight: October lull confirmed: demand stabilized in Periods 35-38 (avg ~61) significantly below September peaks, likely a pause before the core Winter ramp-up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is deep into Autumn. While September showed a sharp spike (avg ~105), October cooled significantly (avg ~61). Period 39 demand dropped to 35, which is surprisingly low for this time of year and suggests a possible stock-up dip or temporary lull before the holidays. However, the season for Long Leggings is traditionally winter, so treating this low print as the new baseline is risky. The demand history for this SKU shows extreme volatility (35 to 121 in just 6 weeks). The current regime seems to be 'Autumn volatility' rather than a stable trough. Given the calendar date (approaching Black Friday/Winter), trusting the recent low mean (35 or 61) too heavily risks stockouts when the winter peak hits. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (covering the start of the Autumn ramp-up in mid-Sept) to capture the higher potential of the season while acknowledging the recent lull, blending the 100+ peaks with the recent 35-60 lows. The holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) implies a high critical ratio (0.8), justifying safety stock to cover the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Winter lull confirmed: Late Oct/Early Nov demand (avg ~53 for P37-39) has dropped significantly below Sept peaks, creating a 'calm before the storm' pattern prior to expected Winter/Holiday demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/11/18 (Period 41). We are in late Autumn, approaching the major Black Friday and Winter Holiday retail events. Recent demand in late October and early November (Periods 35-40) has been suprisingly low (avg ~56.5), creating a 'lull' similar to the pre-Autumn spike. However, the heavy seasonality of Long Leggings implies a significant Winter ramp-up is imminent. The low recent demand (35 units in P39, 60 in P40) resembles the 'calm before the storm' seen in late August before the September explosion. Given the calendar proximity to Black Friday (late Nov), relying solely on the recent lull average (N=6 avg ~56) risks a massive stockout when holiday demand hits (historical max 199 in Feb). I will maintain a weighted forecast that acknowledges the current lull but leans towards the inevitable seasonal increase using a moderate moving average, while keeping L at 'default' (0) as delivery reliability remains perfect.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Holiday Lull: November demand (avg ~47.5 in P39-40) has dropped to summer trough levels, significantly postponing the expected Winter ramp-up. Strategy: maintain readiness for sudden Black Friday spike despite current low signal.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is Black Friday week. Despite the persistent 'Pre-Holiday Lull' (recent periods P39-P41 avg ~44), consumer behavior typically exhibits 'pent-up demand' leading into this major retail event, often triggering spikes 2-3x the baseline. The high Critical Ratio (Profit 4 vs Holding 1) aggressively favors preventing stockouts. Therefore, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast of 110 (matching the Autumn/Winter peak baseline observed in Sept/Jan) to ensure readiness for the expected Black Friday surge. I use 'recent_N=12' for volatility to include the high-variance Sept transition period in the safety stock calculation, further buffering against forecast error.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Holiday Lull intensified in mid-Nov: Period 41 demand (38) remained at summer trough levels, defying expectations of a ramp-up and suggesting strong pent-up demand release for Black Friday.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Black Friday week) demand exploded to 208 units, generating a stockout and confirming the onset of the Peak Holiday/Winter season. Period 43 is Dec 2 (Cyber Monday), so demand is expected to remain extremely high, consistent with the high volumes seen in early 2019 (Jan/Feb peaks up to 199). Historical averages (recent_N) are currently suppressed by the pre-holiday lull (Periods 39-41), so I am using explicit forecasting to target the high-profit winter regime immediately (~155 units) and increasing volatility estimates (sigma=75) to account for the extreme 38->208 jump.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season Peak confirmed: Period 42 demand (208) surged >400% from Nov baseline, aligning with Winter historicals (Jan avg ~140) and marking the definitive end of the Autumn lull.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 9. Period 43 demand dropped to 40 after the massive P42 spike (208), signaling a post-Black Friday lull. However, pre-Christmas shopping is expected to ramp up demand back to Jan historical levels (~100-115). Using a recent_N=3 averages the pre-holiday lull, the BF spike, and the post-BF dip (avg ~95), creating a balanced forecast that accounts for extreme volatility (high sigma) to ensure availability for December shopping peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Post-Black Friday volatility confirmed: Demand plummeted to 40 units (-80% vs P42), verifying the 'sales hangover' effect immediately following the holiday spike. Winter baseline likely remains near ~100 despite this dip.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 represents the critical shopping week before Christmas (Dec 16). While the last two periods (40, 43) indicate a significant post-Black Friday lull or 'hangover,' historical seasonality (Jan/Feb 2019 avg ~120) and the recent Black Friday spike (208) suggest high volatility and potential upside risk. Relying solely on the recent lull (avg ~42) would risk stockouts during the expected holiday rush. Therefore, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 (Periods 42, 43, 44) for both mu and sigma. This sets the mean demand around 97 (blending the high spike and low lull) and generates a very large standard deviation to effectively buffer against a potential Christmas demand surge, balancing the risk of holding inventory against lost holiday sales.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday lull sustained: Early December demand (Periods 43-44) averaged ~41.5 units, dropping ~80% from the Black Friday peak and remaining surprisingly low for the winter season, potentially indicating a 'clean slate' before the immediate pre-Christmas rush.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 demand (181) shattered the post-Black Friday lull hypothesis, surging >300% from the prior weeks to match the pre-Christmas shopping peak. The current environment (Dec 23) is characterized by extreme bimodal volatility (peaks around ~181-208 vs troughs ~40) and zero on-hand inventory. To address this, we switch to a 4-period window for parameters; this captures the full high-variance holiday profile (Black Friday peak + Lull + Christmas peak). The resulting mean (~118) aligns with historical Jan baselines (~100-110), while the high volatility in this window forces a large safety stock buffer to protect against another seasonal spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Christmas Peak confirmed: Period 45 demand (181) surged +320% vs early Dec lull (~42), contradicting the stable low hypothesis. Current Winter regime is defined by extreme bimodal volatility (peaks ~180-200, troughs ~40), requiring parameters that embrace this variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to Dec 30, right after Christmas. Demand in Period 46 (Dec 23) was 155, confirming the strong pre-Christmas peak, though slightly lower than the Black Friday spike (208) or P45 peak (181). We are observing a pattern of extreme volatility ('bimodal winter'): peaks around 150-200 and troughs around 40-50. 

We are now entering the post-holiday clearance/New Year season. Historically (early 2019), Jan/Feb demand was high (100-130 range) for leggings. The current rapid oscillation suggests we shouldn't over-react to single data points, but rather dampen the volatility. Specifically, after a high peak (P46=155), a drop or 'hangover' is possible, but January is generally a strong season for this colder-weather product.

Given the recent extreme variance (Current Sigma ~70 over last 5 periods), relying on a short recent_N for mu_hat might be too reactive. A wider window (last 6-8 periods) captures the full holiday cycle (Black Friday through Xmas). The average of the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is ~125. However, this includes two massive spikes. A more conservative estimates for 'normal' winter weeks is around 100-110. 

I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the high-volatility winter profile (Avg ~125, high sigma) to ensure safety stock is sufficient for another potential spike (like New Year or cold snap) without overstocking if demand drops to 'hangover' levels.

Carry-over insight: Winter volatility confirmed as 'oscillating': Demand alternates between deep lulls (~40) and massive spikes (~155-200). Post-Christmas demand (P46=155) remained robust.
