Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. I have historical data from Jan 7, 2019, to Feb 4, 2019. The demand shows a clear downward trend: 105, 62, 72, 48, 36. This suggests possible seasonality (post-holiday decline) or a dying trend for this accessory. The most recent demand (36) is significantly lower than the average of the whole history. Given the date (Feb 11), we are moving further away from the holiday season. To avoid overstocking in a declining demand scenario, I will use a `recent_N` method for `mu_hat`, focusing on the last 3 periods to capture the lower recent demand levels (72, 48, 36 average ~52) rather than the older high values. Promised lead time is 0. Since there is no history of arrivals yet, I will stick to the default lead time. I will calculate `sigma_hat` using the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 demand (40) confirms the lower demand level seen in early February (36), significantly down from the January peak (105). We are likely in a post-holiday low-season regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 (samples: 40, 36, 48) to exclude the irrelevant high demand from early January. Lead time was confirmed as 0 periods in Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization confirmed: recent 3 periods avg ~41 units, significantly lower than Jan avg >70.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 demand spiked to 87, contradicting the prior stabilization hypothesis and causing a stockout. With a high service level target (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must react to this volatility. L remains reliably 0. Switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to incorporate the full range of recent Feb variance (36, 40, 87) and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: High volatility returned in late Feb: Period 2 demand (87) nearly double the prior average, invalidating stabilization theory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $206.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/3/4. Demand in Feb (Periods 1-3) has been 40, 87, 57, averaging ~61 units. This indicates a recovery from the early Feb low (36 in historical data, 40 in P1) but persistent high volatility (std dev ~24). Relying on the most recent 3 periods (recent_N=3) excludes the non-representative January holiday clearance/slump data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Parameters set to cover expected demand ~61 plus safety stock for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Feb demand level stabilized around mean ~61 (last 3 periods: 40, 87, 57), significantly higher than early Feb lows, though volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11, 2019. Demand for the last 3 periods has been fairly consistent but volatile (87, 57, 61), averaging ~68.3 units/period, which is significantly higher than the early Feb low (40) and aligns more with the January average (~65). This suggests a Spring season pick-up for accessories like belts. The previous insight about Feb stabilization around 61 seems partially correct, but the average is drifting upward. Actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders arrive same period). Given the high volatility (sigma is large relative to mean) and the critical ratio of 0.8, we need a robust safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this recent higher-volume, volatile regime (avg ~68, high variance). Lead time method remains default (0) as verified by history.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge indicated: Last 3 periods avg ~68 units, consistently higher than early Feb lull.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 6 (March 18). We stocked out in Period 5 (demand 98 > available 83). Observed lead time reliably remains 0. Demand exhibits a strong spring surge pattern with high volatility (range 57-98 in last 3 weeks). To recover inventory and capture the higher mean demand, we set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 (approx avg 76, excluding the early Feb lull). We set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (approx std 23) to capture the wide swing from the Feb low (40) to the current high (98), ensuring sufficient safety stock given the 80% critical ratio target.

Carry-over insight: Spring surge confirmed: Period 5 demand (98) solidifies upward trend; Last 4 periods avg ~76, significantly above Feb low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 represents late March. While Period 6 demand (50) dipped executionally from Period 5's high (98), the overall spring baseline remains elevated compared to early Feb. The 5-period average is approximately 71 units, significantly higher than the pre-game/early-game lows. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) and significant volatility (swings between 50 and 98), we continue to prioritize availability. We select recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full scope of this erratic spring regime while filtering out the irrelevant January data. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand volatility high: while average demand holds ~70, weekly variance is large (50-98 range), requiring higher safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st). Demand in Period 7 (57 units) aligns with the recent Spring pattern of moderate average demand punctuated by volatility. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (all orders arrive same-period). I am using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to rely exclusively on March data (Periods 4-7: 61, 98, 50, 57), which averages 66.5. This captures the current demand level better than including the February dip or the January highs, and the volatility estimate accounts for the recent spike to 98 to protect service levels.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has cooled post-March surge, stabilizing around 51 units/week (last 3 periods: 50, 57, 47). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this lower plateau better than longer averages, preventing overstock given the high holding cost ratio. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Post-March surge, demand has stabilized around ~51 units/week (last 3 periods avg), significantly down from the ~76 observed in mid-March.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April): Demand has stabilized significantly following the March surge. The last 3 periods (57, 47, 46) show a tight range with an average of ~50 units, markedly lower than the Period 5 peak of 98. Lead times remain consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival). Given the high critical ratio (0.8), we must balance avoiding stockouts with not over-ordering in a declining trend. Detailed Strategy: 1) Lead Time: Keep 'default' (0) as performance is perfect. 2) Mean Demand (mu_hat): Use 'recent_N' with N=3 to closely track the recent lower volume (~50) and avoid overestimating based on older peaks. 3) Volatility (sigma_hat): Use 'recent_N' with N=5 (includes the tail end of the high volatility period) to maintain a safety stock buffer against potential random spikes, consistent with the high profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Volatility dampening: Recent 3 periods (P7-P9) show significantly reduced variance (range 46-57) compared to March spikes, confirming a stable low-demand regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (Late April). Demand has stabilized into a low-volatility regime over the last 5 weeks (Periods 6-10), with an average of ~48.6 units and a much tighter standard deviation compared to early March. The outlier peak of 98 in Period 5 is now outside the recent window. L=0 remains consistent with no missing shipments. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma to focus strictly on this stable post-surge regime, filtering out the older high-volatility data to reduce excess holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 0.8 critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Stable low-demand regime solidifying: Last 5 periods (P6-P10) show consistent avg ~49 units with low variance, confirming the end of the March volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has settled into a very stable regime averaging ~49 units over the last 5 weeks with low variance. We use recent_N=5 to align the forecast with this specific post-Easter/Spring stability, discarding the noisy March data. On-hand is low (4 units), so accuracy is critical to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Stable low-demand regime solidifying: Last 5 periods (P7-P11) show consistent avg ~48.6 units with very low variance (std dev ~5.3), confirming the end of the March volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand remains stable in the ~50 range, though P12 stockout (demand 58) indicates we need to maintain coverage. Using N=6 for both mean and std captures the stable regime since late March (P7-P12) while incorporating the slight recent uptick.

Carry-over insight: Stable low-demand regime continuing: P7-P12 avg ~50.1 units with low volatility (std dev ~6.0), despite minor uptick in P12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (mid-May) indicates a breakdown of the previous low-demand regime. After stabilizing around ~50 units, demand has accelerated upward in P12 (58) and P13 (77), causing consecutive stockouts. This surge aligns with potential seasonal warming (summer hip belt demand). To address the stockouts and catch the rising trend while mitigating the risk of a single-outlier overreaction, we switch to a short-memory N=3 forecast. This raises the base stock level significantly above the previous 'quiet' period to protect service levels (CR=0.8). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand stability broken: Demand surged in P12 (58) and P13 (77), significantly exceeding the prior ~49 unit plateau and causing consecutive stockouts; volatile uptrend detected.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) decision. The low-demand stability observed in April has been completely shattered. Demand has surged aggressively over the last three periods: 58 (P12) -> 77 (P13) -> 139 (P14)! This represents a massive spike, likely a seasonal trend or promotion. The system has stocked out for 3 consecutive periods, hitting zero inventory each time, meaning actual demand is likely even higher or at least fully uncapped. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 0, the risk of lost sales is extreme. I must pivot immediately to a high-demand regime forecast. Using the last 3 periods (avg ~91.3) captures this new surge better than longer averages. Volatility is also extremely high (observation of 139 is an outlier compared to history), so sigma must increase significantly to buffer against this uncertainty. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge confirmed: P14 demand hit 139, tripling the April average (~49); 3-period trend (58->77->139) indicates a shift to a high-volume regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (end of May) indicates a solidified high-demand regime likely driven by seasonal factors. Demand in Period 15 (138) matched Period 14 (139), confirming the surge is a sustained plateau (~140 units) rather than a transient spike. Previous stockouts occurred because trailing averages (like N=3 yielding ~118) lagged behind this abrupt 3x volume increase. To prevent further lost sales, we switch to an explicit forecast of 140 (matching the recent 2-period average). We retain 'recent_N=3' for volatility to keep safety stock buffers high (std dev ~35.5) as a hedge against further variance. Lead time consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand plateau confirmed: Period 15 demand (138) replicates Period 14 (139), validating a new stable regime at ~140 units (approx 3x the April average).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has firmly plateaued at a high volume, with the last 3 periods showing remarkable stability (139, 138, 138). To reflect this new mean accurately without lag, I set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 (avg ~138.3). However, calculating volatility on just these 3 stable points would result in near-zero safety stock, which is risky given the recent regime shift. Therefore, I set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the transition 58->77->139->138->138) to generate a robust standard deviation (~39) and safety buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand plateau holds: Last 3 periods (P14-P16) demand extremely stable at ~138 units (139, 138, 138), confirming sustained 3x volume increase over April levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10). The high-demand regime characterized by the May surge (P14-P16 avg ~138) persists, though Period 17 showed a slight softening to 121 units (-12% from peak). This level is still >2x the April average (~50), confirming the high volume is sustainable for now. Lead times remain consistently 0. We select N=4 for demand and volatility to capture the full extent of this new high-volume regime while incorporating the variance introduced by the recent dip to 121. This sets a responsive base stock that protects against stockouts (critical fractile 0.8) without overreacting to the single lower data point.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime softening: P17 demand (121) dropped ~12% from the ~138 plateau established in P14-P16, though remains significantly above historical norms; volatility has re-emerged after a period of stability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (June 17). The high-demand regime characterized by summer seasonality (belts/accessories) has sustained for 5 periods (P14-P18), averaging ~132 units/week. While P17 (121) and P18 (126) were slightly below the initial surge peak (139), the volume remains consistently >2.5x the April average. To accurately capture this new active regime without effectively 'diluting' the forecast with irrelevant low-volume April data, I am setting N=5 for both mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock (calculated around ~132 mean + safety stock) is sufficient to cover the observed 120-140 range. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volume regime sustained: Last 5 periods (P14-P18) average ~132 units. Demand appears to have settled in the 120-140 range, well above historical norms, with moderate volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June). Demand remains in a high-volume regime but has settled into a stable 'lower plateau' around ~123 units for the last 3 periods (P17-P19: 121, 126, 122), compared to the ~138 peak seen in mid-May. Given the high profit ratio ($4 margin/$1 holding), prioritizing service level covers the risk of demand returning to peak levels. We select N=6 (covering P14-P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach incorporates both the peak (~138) and the recent stability (~123), resulting in a forecast mean of ~131 units. This slight over-forecast relative to the most recent weeks acts as a prudent buffer against stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilizing at lower plateau: Last 3 periods (P17-P19) avg ~123 units, consistently below the mid-May peak of ~138, with very low volatility (std dev ~2.6).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st) marks the beginning of Q3. The high-demand regime that began in mid-May (approx. Period 14) appears to be shifting. Demand in Period 20 dropped to 98, effectively breaking the ~120-140 unit plateau maintained from P14 to P19. While 98 is still significantly higher than the April baseline (~50), it suggests the peak season for this accessory may be cooling down. The average of the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is (126+122+98)/3 \u2248 115.3, with increasing variance as the trend turns downward. Given the lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed in P20 conclude), I will set parameters based heavily on this recent 'cooling' high-demand signal (N=3) to avoid overstocking as we exit the peak, but still protecting against lingering volatility. Standard deviation calculation will also use recent N=3 to capture the fluctuation between 98 and 126.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling signal: Period 20 demand (98) dropped below the 120-140 plateau of the last 6 weeks, suggesting the high-demand season is tapering off.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8th). Demand has confirmed a downward shift (cooling) from the Spring/early Summer peak. Last two periods (P20=98, P21=94) average ~96, significantly below the May/June average of ~132. We interpret this as a seasonal stabilization at a lower level. Given the high cost of underage ($4 profit) vs overage ($1 holding), we calculate 'mu_hat' using 'recent_N' with N=3 (avg ~105) rather than N=2 (avg ~96) to bias slightly upwards and avoid stocking out if the drop stabilizes higher or rebounds slightly. Lead time remains consistently 0. Reviewing volatility over the last 5 periods (sigma_hat, N=5) captures the variance of the recent step-down.

Carry-over insight: Summer cooling confirmed: Demand steadily averaging ~96 units for last 2 periods (P20-P21), confirming a new lower plateau compared to the ~130s seen in May/June.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (July 15). Demand continues to cool significantly from the May/June peak. The previous plateau of ~96 units (Periods 20-21) has dropped further to 75 units in Period 22. This 75 is much closer to the pre-summer levels (March/April avg ~50-70) than the peak levels (138). While P20-P21 suggested a stabilization around 96, P22's drop to 75 breaks that floor, indicating the seasonal high is ending. I will use a short-horizon estimator (recent_N=3: 98, 94, 75 -> avg 89) to capture this downward trend without overreacting to a single point (75) completely, as volatility remains. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling deepens: P22 demand (75) is significantly below the P20-P21 plateau (~96) and the May peak (~138), indicating a return toward historical norms.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (Late July). The high-demand summer season (May/June) has unequivocally cooled. Demand has dropped sequentially from a peak of ~140 to a recent average of ~73.5 in the last two periods (75, 72). This indicates a return towards the historical norms or potentially the ~50 level seen in April. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, critical ratio 0.8), the cost of stocking out outweighs holding costs. Thus, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg ~80) to capture the cooling trend while retaining a buffer above the most recent low values. Sigma_hat using recent_N=5 captures the variance inherent in the recent step-down, providing a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer cooling stabilizing: Demand averaged ~73.5 units in last 2 periods (P22-P23), a distinct step down from the ~96 unit level in early July and significantly below the May/June peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29). Demand continues its significant cooling trend following the May/June seasonal peak. Period 24 demand (52 units) has dropped sharply from the ~73 average of the prior two weeks, effectively returning to the baseline levels observed in March/April (~50 units). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods. To manage this rapid normalization without understocking if volatility persists, we use a short-term moving average (N=3) which forecasts around 66 units\u2014a safe buffer slightly above the likely new baseline of ~50.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August. The summer demand peak has fully dissipated. Recent demand (P22-P25: 75, 72, 52, 66) averages ~66 units, significantly lower than the May/June highs (>120) and approaching the pre-season spring baseline (~50-60). A slight uptick in Period 25 suggests stabilization in the 50-70 range rather than a continuous freefall. We set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to focus strictly on this new lower-volume regime, excluding the transitionary high demand from Period 21 (94). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer cooling stabilizes near pre-season norms: Last 4 periods (P22-P25) avg ~66 units, significantly down from May/June peak (>120), aligning closer to historical spring baseline (~50-60).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (mid-August). Demand has stabilized following the summer peak cooling. The last 5 periods (P22-P26) average 66.8 units with a range of 52-75, confirming a return to a steady baseline similar to spring levels. The most recent demand (P26=69) aligns perfectly with this 5-period average. Inventory is critically low (6 units), requiring immediate replenishment. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this specific post-summer stabilization regime, ensuring the system targets the active demand level ~67 rather than the inflated annual average.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Aug 19 (Period 28). The post-summer stabilization trend detected in previous periods has held firm. For the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged ~66 units with moderate volatility (range 52-75), distinctly below the summer peak but slightly above the spring baseline. This confirms a reliable 'Late Summer' plateau. On-hand inventory is low (12 units) relative to expected demand (~66), necessitating a robust order. Lead time consistently remains 0 as promised. I am using recent_N=6 for both mean and volatility to capture this entire 6-week stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer plateau confirmed: Last 6 periods (P22-P27) demand averaged ~66 units with consistent stability, establishing a new regime significantly below the May/June peak (~130s) but above early year lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 demand spiked to 84 units, significantly exceeding the ~66 unit average established over the prior 6 weeks (P22-P27) and causing a stockout. This interruption of the 'summer cooling' trend suggests either a transient spike or the start of a seasonal transition (back-to-school/fall). To mitigate stockout risk (Profit > Holding cost), I am switching mu_hat to a more responsive N=3 (avg approx 72) to capture the upward shift, while keeping sigma_hat at N=5 to reflect recent volatility observed since the cooling began.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound/volatility: Period 28 demand (84) broke the ~66 unit plateau of the prior 6 weeks, causing a stockout. Suggests potential shift away from summer cooling trend.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 corresponds to early September, suggesting a seasonal transition to Fall. Demand has clearly shifted upward from the summer plateau (~66 units) to a new level around ~83-84 units in the last two periods (P28, P29), resulting in consecutive stockouts (0 ending inventory). The previous insight of a rebound is now confirmed as a sustained shift. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to immediately adapt to the observed ~83.5 unit average. I am setting sigma_hat with recent_N=5 (std dev ~9.8) to capture the volatility inherent in this step-change while maintaining a safety buffer. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand shift confirmed: Demand sustained at ~83 units (P28:84, P29:83) for the last 2 periods, establishing a new plateau ~25% higher than the summer average (66).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9): Demand has surged aggressively in the last 3 periods (P28:84, P29:83, P30:111), breaking the summer cooling trend. The Period 30 spike to 111 units caused a stockout for the third consecutive week (ending inventory 0 in P28, P29, P30). This 111 unit demand is significantly above the prior 6-week average of ~66 and approaches the May high-demand regime levels. With three straight stockouts and an accelerating upward trend, the system is currently under-forecasting. I am switching to a reactive 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this sharp Fall increase immediately (avg of last 3 is ~92.7). Volatility is also rising (range 83-111), so sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to buffer against further spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall Demand Surge: Demand accelerating rapidly, P30 hit 111 (highest since June), triggering 3rd consecutive stockout. Regime has shifted significantly above summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 demand (100 units) confirms the Fall surge detected in the previous period, sustaining levels significantly above the summer baseline of ~66 units. The most recent two periods (111, 100) average ~105 units, indicating a robust seasonal shift likely driven by fall fashion trends (mid-September). Although the stockout streak ended in Period 31, ending inventory is critically low (7 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 to tightly track this new high-volume regime (avg ~98 units over P29-P31) and ensure sufficient buffer against volatility, while keeping Lead Time at default (0) as reliable delivery continues.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-demand regime confirmed: P31 demand (100) sustains the surge seen in P30 (111), establishing a new plateau ~105 units/week, roughly +50% vs summer levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sep 23, 2019. We are in a confirmed high-demand fall regime. Period 32 demand was 89, cooling slightly from the 100-111 peaks of P30-P31 but remaining well above the summer average (~66). The last 3 periods (P30-P32) average exactly 100 units (111, 100, 89), but the most recent observation shows a downward adjustment. A 3-period average captures this recent surge while respecting the slight dip in P32. 'recent_N=3' effectively targets the current ~100 mean. Volatility is moderate/high during this transition, so recent_N=3 for sigma is also appropriate to capture the local variance. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall volatility detected: After peaking at 111 (P30), demand is gently tapering (100->89). Last 3 periods avg 100, confirming the regime is still significantly elevated above summer norms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sep 30). Huge demand spike in Period 33 (189 units) crushed the previous Fall plateau (~100 units) and exhausted inventory, causing a stockout. This 189 is double the recent average (P30-P32 avg ~100) and the highest demand ever recorded for this SKU. This likely indicates a major seasonal event or promotion. Given the volatility (P32: 89 -> P33: 189), relying on a long-term average (default) would be disastrously slow to react. We must react aggressively to this new peak while acknowledging it might be a singular outlier or start of a new ultra-high regime. I will use a very short memory (recent_3) for mu_hat to capture this surge quickly (avg of 100, 89, 189 is approx 126), and recent_3 for sigma_hat to reflect the extreme volatility (std dev of 100, 89, 189 is high). Promised lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme Fall Volatility/Surge: Period 33 demand spiked to 189 (highest ever), nearly double the prior week (89) and well above the ~100 unit plateau. This shattered the previous Fall regime hypothesis.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7) analysis: Demand in P34 dropped significantly to 95 from the extreme P33 spike of 189. This confirms P33 was an isolated outlier or 'false peak' rather than a new sustained regime of ~190 units. The recent trend (P30-P34 excluding P33) suggests a volatile Fall plateau averaging around ~99 units (avg of 111, 100, 89, 95). While P33's 189 was extreme, P34's return to 95 aligns with the elevated Fall demand observed since early September. Given the high volatility (std dev remains high due to P33), I will use a robust recent average (last 5 periods) for mu_hat to capture the elevated baseline while smoothing the outlier. Sigma needs to remain elevated to protect against another spike, so I will use the recent N standard deviation. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall volatility continues: P34 demand (95) dropped sharply from P33 outlier (189), returning to the ~100 unit plateau established in Sept. P33 confirmed as extreme outlier, but overall regime remains elevated ~50% above summer levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 corresponds to mid-October. Following the extreme outlier in Period 33 (189 units), demand has stabilized for two consecutive periods (Period 34: 95, Period 35: 90). This confirms that P33 was an isolated volatility event and the underlying 'Fall Regime' is holding steady around ~90-100 units (consistent with P31-P32). However, given the recent volatility and the overall elevated volume compared to summer, we must remain buffered. I am selecting N=6 for estimation to encompass the entire Fall active period (P30-P35). This averaging window (mean ~112, high sigma due to outlier) naturally incorporates a safety buffer against recurrence of spikes without over-reacting to the single most recent stable data point. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall Stability Returns: Following the P33 outlier (189), demand has immediately stabilized in the 90-95 range (P34:95, P35:90), realigning with the early Fall plateau. The regime remains roughly 50% above summer levels, but the extreme volatility of P33 appears isolated.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized post-outlier (P33) with a 3-week average of ~94 units (P34-P36: 95, 90, 97). N=3 accurately captures this stable Fall plateau while excluding the extreme volatility of late Sept. Volatility has decreased significantly (std dev ~3.6 for last 3 periods). L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand stability confirmed: Since the P33 outlier, demand has held a tight range (90-97) for 3 weeks (P34-P36), establishing a reliable Fall baseline of ~94 units, roughly +45% over Summer levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 38 (Oct 28). Status: On-hand 0, total stockouts in P37 (Demand 98 > Supply 98). Fall demand stability continues; excluding the P33 outlier (189), demand has remained within a tight band of [89-100] for 7 weeks (P31-P37 ex P33) with an average around 95. The most recent demand (P37) was 98. This indicates a robust Fall regime ~45% higher than the summer low. Given the P37 stockout (ending inventory 0), re-establishing safety stock is critical. Lead time remains 0 consistently. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 (ex outlier) or N=7 to capture the stable Fall plateau effectively. I will use N=7 to smooth variance while capturing the sustained Fall level (~98 units avg including outlier, or lower excluding it). Actually, recent 4 periods (P34-P37) are 95, 90, 97, 98 -> Avg 95. This is very stable. I will use recent_N=6 to include some early Oct/late Sept context but stabilize estimation. Volatility is relatively low recently so recent_N for sigma is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime stable: Last 4 periods (P34-P37) show remarkable consistency with avg ~95 units (range 90-98), confirming the steady Fall plateau following the Sept volatility. P37 stockout emphasizes need for adequate buffer against this sustained higher volume.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand dropped sharply to 48 units, disrupting the stable Fall plateau of ~95 units observed in P34-P37. This 50% decrease could be a pre-holiday lull or a volatility spike. With November holiday events (Singles Day, Black Friday) approaching, reacting solely to the low signal is risky. We switch to N=5 for estimation, which lowers the mean forecast to ~86 but significantly increases the volatility estimate (sigma), ensuring the safety stock buffer accounts for this instability while preserving readiness for potential holiday volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Fall plateau broken: P38 demand (48) dropped ~50% from the recent ~95 unit average, introducing significant volatility ahead of the holiday season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Nov 11, 2019. We are entering the pre-holiday season, but the immediate demand signal shows a significant drop. After a stable Fall plateau of ~95 units (P34-P37), demand crashed to 48 (P38) and 41 (P39), averaging just 44.5 units in the last 2 periods. This drastic reduction (~50% drop) suggests a pre-holiday lull or a regime shift back to Spring/low levels. However, given the date (mid-Nov), we must be cautious of Black Friday/Holiday spikes looming. The P33 outlier (189) and Fall plateau (95) show high potential volume, but recent data (48, 41) cannot be ignored. We will adopt a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 to capture this immediate drop, but keep variance high to buffer against a sudden holiday rebound. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lull confirmed: Demand dropped sharply to ~45 units (P38: 48, P39: 41), nearly 50% below the recent Fall plateau of ~95, signaling a potential calm before the holiday storm.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 corresponds to mid-November (Nov 18-24), the week immediately preceding Black Friday. Demand has cratered in the last 3 periods (48->41->29), colloquially known as the 'calm before the storm' in retail. While the short-term trend (N=3) suggests a mean of ~39 units, relying on this risks severe stockouts when demand inevitably rebounds for the holidays in P42. We actively choose 'recent_N=5' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the tail end of the high Fall plateau (P36/P37 ~98 units). This blends the datasets, raising the mean forecast to ~63 and significantly inflating the variance (sigma). This high-variance signal forces the OR backend to hold more safety stock, effectively stockpiling inventory now to buffer against the anticipated Black Friday volume in the next period. Lead time remains effectively 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lull intensifies: Demand hit a 6-month low at 29 units (P40), extending the steep 3-week decline. However, with Black Friday imminent (P42), this low-volume regime is treated as a temporary volatility dip rather than a lasting trend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) marks the start of Black Friday week. While recent demand (P38-P41) has been exceptionally low (avg ~38 units), this 'calm before the storm' is typical pre-holiday behavior. The historical Fall plateau (P34-P37) was stable around ~95 units. Given Black Friday is imminent, relying on the recent lull (P40-P41) would be disastrous. I will pivot back to the stable Fall baseline (~95) as a conservative proxy for the holiday surge start, expecting volume to rebound significantly from the pre-holiday dip. Promise lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lull stabilized: Last 4 periods (P38-P41) avg ~38 units, confirming a deep suppression of demand before the expected Black Friday rebound.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 confirmed the anticipated Black Friday surge with a massive demand of 227 units, shattering the pre-holiday lull (avg ~38). This shifted the regime from a suppressed state to high-volatility holiday peak. Current inventory is 0. Strategy: Use 'recent_N' = 5 for both mu and sigma. This window captures the massive P42 spike alongside the preceding lull, resulting in a moderate mean estimate (~76) but a very high standard deviation (~85). This high volatility drives the safety stock calculation significantly upward (Target Base Stock \u2248 147), ensuring coverage for continued holiday demand (likely in the 100-140 range) while accounting for the extreme uncertainty of the season. Lead time remains observed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season Surge Confirmed: Period 42 (Black Friday) demand hit 227 units, ending the pre-holiday lull. Demand regime has shifted to high-volume/high-volatility for December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 represents the core December holiday shopping window. Following the extreme Black Friday spike of Period 42 (227 units), Period 43 demand settled at 87 units. This level is significantly higher than the pre-holiday lull (~38 avg) and aligns closely with the robust Fall plateau (~95 avg) seen in periods 34-37. While demand has dropped from the outlier peak, it remains elevated and volatile. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window (P41-P43) captures the transition from lull to peak to settling, resulting in a conservative high mean (~116) and large standard deviation to generate sufficient safety stock for uncertain December demand. This minimizes the risk of stockouts (high lost profit cost) during the critical gift-giving weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand normalization: Period 43 demand (87) has settled back to the ~90-100 unit range observed in the Fall plateau, confirming that while the Black Friday spike (227) was an event, the baseline holiday demand remains significantly elevated (+100%) above the pre-holiday lull.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) is the final major shipping week before Christmas. Demand in Period 44 (108 units) confirms the Holiday regime is holding around ~100 units, significantly above the pre-holiday lull but below the Black Friday spike (227). The 'carry_over' insight from P44 suggested normalization, and P44's actual demand aligns with the Fall plateau range (~95-100). With only a few periods left in the year, we must cover the remaining holiday rush while being mindful of post-holiday inventory risk. Given the 0-period lead time, we can react quickly. I will maintain a robust forecast using the recent 4-week average (which includes Black Friday, naturally inflating the mean to cover potential last-minute gift spikes) to ensure high service levels during this critical profit week. Volatility remains high, so safety stock is crucial.

Carry-over insight: Holiday plateau sustained: Last 2 periods (P43-P44) average ~97.5 units, confirming a stable but elevated demand regime roughly double the pre-holiday lull, despite being well below the Black Friday peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 corresponds to Dec 23rd, the final week before Christmas. Historical data (last year samples) and current trend suggest demand remains elevated but stable around 100-110 units (P44: 108, P45: 104). The Black Friday spike (227) is well past, and the pre-holiday lull is over. We are in the core holiday plateau. Last 3 periods average ~100 units. Variances are low (range 87-108). Lead time remains reliably 0. I will maintain recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this stable holiday plateau of ~100 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current stable volatility, avoiding the artifact of the Black Friday outlier which is no longer relevant for the immediate next period's forecast. The inventory position (79 units) is healthy against a mean of ~100, requiring a top-up.

Carry-over insight: Holiday plateau stabilizing: Last 3 periods (P43-P45) average ~99.6 units, effectively remarkably stable around 100 units/week, maintaining the post-Black Friday regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 30 (Period 47). We are exiting the peak holiday season. Recent demand in P43-P46 has been elevated (avg ~92.75) compared to the pre-holiday lull, but the most recent observation in Period 46 (Dec 23) dropped to 72, hinting at the beginning of the post-holiday cooling. This is likely the start of the 'New Year' lull similar to what was observed in early 2019 (Jan 2019 avg ~64). While the Holiday plateau (P43-P45) was around 100 units, the drop to 72 signals a shift. I will treat the Holiday plateau as ending and anticipate a return to more moderate levels (~70-75). I will use a recent_N=3 on demand to capture the downward trend (108 -> 104 -> 72) quickly while still buffering against residual holiday returns/gift card spending. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday cooling detected: Period 46 demand (72) dropped significantly from the ~100 unit holiday plateau (P43-P45), signaling the end of the peak season.
