Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows demand ranging between 41 and 59 units, with an average around 49.2 units. The most recent data point (Feb 4) was 53. Given the short promised lead time (0 periods), orders placed now should arrive instantly to satisfy today's demand. With current inventory at 0, we must cover immediate demand. The holding cost ($1.00) is very high relative to profit ($4.00), so overstocking is dangerous. We aim to cover slightly above average demand to prevent stockouts but avoid excess. A forecast of ~50-55 is reasonable. Ordering 55 units covers the upper end of recent history without excessive risk.",

Based on the current period state and history, here is the reasoning and action plan:

```json
{
  "rationale": "For Period 3 (2019/02/25), I am managing a narrow hip belt accessory. \n\n1. **Lead Time Analysis**: The history confirms that orders placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (0 periods lead time), and orders in Period 2 arrived in Period 2. The supplier is reliably delivering with L=0. This allows for 'Just-in-Time' ordering.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: \n   - **Historical Samples (Jan/Feb 2019)**: Weekly demands were 41, 59, 44, 49, 53. Average ~49. \n   - **Period 1 (Feb 11)**: Demand was 72. This is a noticeable jump above the historical average.\n   - **Period 2 (Feb 18)**: Demand spiked massively to 150. This is a very significant deviation (3x average). \n   - **Seasonality/Context**: The date 2019/2/25 is late February. This might be related to early spring fashion releases or clearance sales. The jump from 50s -> 70s -> 150 suggests a strong upward trend or a viral item/promotion effect. \n\n3. **Forecast**: Demand is highly volatile and trending aggressively upward. The jump to 150 is concerning to ignore, but assuming it will stay at 150 carries risk if it was a one-off outlier. However, since Profit ($4) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1) and lead time is instant (0 periods), the cost of understocking (stockout) is high relative to overstocking. It is safer to chase the demand. I will forecast demand around 150-160 to cover the recent peak, potentially slightly higher to capture continued growth, but tempering slightly as 150 is a drastic outlier compared to the 50 baseline.\n\n4. **Inventory Position**: \n   - On-hand: 0\n   - In-transit: 0 (All previous orders arrived and sold out immediately).\n   - Pipeline: 0.\n\n5. **Order Quantity**: \n   - Target Level = Forecast Demand (since L=0, we only need coverage for the current period). \n   - Recent demand was 150. Given the strong upward momentum and high lost sales penalty (implicit in profit vs holding), I will order 160 units to aim for full service level if the trend holds, while accepting some holding risk if it reverts.",

A safe forecast assumes demand returns to the elevated baseline of ~70-80 rather than the outlier 150.

Lead Time Analysis: Confirmed lead_time is 0 periods consistently. Orders arrive immediately for use in the same period. Demand Analysis: Recent demand was: P4(48) -> P5(53) -> P6(60) -> P7(68) -> P8(45). The steady growth trend in March (reaching 68) was interrupted by a significant dip in P8 (45), which brought demand back down to early Feb/March baseline levels. The linear growth hypothesis from P8 no longer holds strongly. The average of the last 4 periods is (53+60+68+45)/4 = 56.5. A more conservative window (last 5) is similarly average ~55. Given the high stockout cost relative to holding ($4 vs $1, CR=0.8), we aim to cover high-end variance. The recent peak was 68 (ignoring the Feb outlier of 150). A safe forecast is around 60-65 to accommodate a rebound from the dip. Inventory Status: Current on-hand is 35 units.

======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical data, here is the decision rationale and execution:

### Rationale

**1. Demand Analysis & Trends:**
- **Product:** "Flora hip belt (1)". A standard accessory item.
- **Recent Regime:** After a volatile February (spikes up to 150) and a brief upward trend in March (peaking at 68), April demand has clearly stabilized at a lower mean.
- **April Data points:**
  - P8 (Apr 1): 45
  - P9 (Apr 8): 46
  - P10 (Apr 15): 39
- **Insights:** The April average is approx. 43.3 units. This aligns closely with the January baseline (~49) and suggests the slight March growth was temporary. The P10 drop to 39 likely indicates a continuation of this stable-to-slightly-low demand.
- **Forecast:** With no major holidays approaching in late April, I will forecast closely to recent averages. I estimate demand around 43-48 units.

**2. Supply Chain Parameters:**
- **Lead Time:** Consistently observed as 0 periods (same-period arrival).
- **Service Level:** Profit ($4) vs Holding ($1) ratio is 4:1. The critical ratio is $4 / ($4+$1) = 0.8. This justifies carrying enough stock to cover demand volatility (approx. 80th percentile).
- **Target Inventory:** Given the mean of ~43 and standard deviation in stable periods (approx 5-7), a safe target is around 50-52 units. This covers the potential for demand to bounce back to the high 40s/low 50s without excessive overstock.

**3. Inventory Position:**
- **Current On-Hand:** 21 units.
- **In-Transit:** 0 units.
- **Total Supply:** 21 units.

**4. Order Calculation:**
- **Target Level:** 52 units (aggressive enough for service level 80% but conservative given the downtrend).
- **Gap:** 52 (Target) - 21 (Current) = 31 units.
- **Decision:** I will order 31 units to reach the target level.

Given the high cost of lost sales vs holding cost (Ratio 4:1), the optimal inventory strategy targets a service level around 80%.

{
  "rationale": "Product (Women's Belt) enters May (Spring/Summer), traditionally a stronger season for accessories. Period 12 showed a massive demand spike to 101 units, breaking the stable April baseline of ~44 units. This resurgence of volatility mirrors the high-variance regime seen in February. With Current On-Hand at 0 and Lead Time at 0, an immediate replenishment is required. Given the high Profit-to-Holding cost ratio ($4 margin vs $1 holding cost), the penalty for stocking out ($4/unit) is 4x the penalty for holding excess inventory ($1/unit). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to order aggressively to cover the potential for sustained high demand or a slow decay from the spike (similar to Period 3's 78 units following Period 2's 150).

======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical analysis, here is the reasoning and decision for Period 16.

### Rationale

**1. World Knowledge & Product Analysis**
The current date is May 27, 2019. In many regions, this corresponds to late Spring/early Summer. The "Flora hip belt" is a fashion accessory.
*   **Calendar Events**: We have just passed the Mother's Day peak (Periods 12-13, early May). Demand has noticeably cooled since then.
*   **Seasonality**: Summer is approaching. Fashion accessories often see stable or slightly elevated demand in summer compared to winter, but the huge May spike was clearly event-driven.

**2. Demand Regime Analysis**
*   **Recent History**:
    *   **April Baseline**: ~44 units (low volatility).
    *   **May Spike (Mother's Day)**: P12 (101), P13 (109).
    *   **Post-Peak Stabilization**: P14 (69), P15 (57).
*   **Current State**: The demand is rapidly decaying back towards the pre-May baseline. The drop from 109 -> 69 -> 57 shows a clear downward trend.
*   **Forecast**: It is likely demand will continue to settle. The April baseline was ~44. The current decay suggests we might hit somewhere between 45-55 in Period 16. A safe forecast assumes we are returning to the ~50-55 range, potentially slightly higher due to summer seasonality, but definitely not the 100+ range. Let's estimate a mean of ~60 to be safe (covering the tail end of the high demand), but acknowledge the trend is down.

**3. Lead Time & Pipeline**
*   **Lead Time**: Consistently 0 periods. Orders arrive same-day.
*   **Pipeline**:
    *   On-hand: 34 units.
    *   In-transit: 0 units.

**4. Inventory Strategy**
*   **Target Inventory**: With Profit \$4 vs Holding \$1, the Critical Ratio is $4/(4+1) = 0.80$. We want to cover demand up to the 80th percentile.
*   **Forecast Range**: Based on the P14-P15 trend (69 -> 57), demand for P16 is likely around 50-60.
*   **Safety Buffer**: Given the recent volatility, we should protect against a random fluctuation upwards. Demand hasn't fully hit the April low of 44 yet.
*   **Calculation**:
    *   Estimated Demand: ~60 units (conservative estimate).
    *   Target Stock: ~70 units (60 mean + 10 safety stock).
    *   Current Stock: 34 units.
    *   Order Quantity: 70 - 34 = 36 units.

Since the demand dropped from 69 to 57, and before the spike it was ~45, ordering to reach around 65-70 total availability is a balanced approach. It covers the P15 demand (57) with a buffer, but doesn't overstock if we return to 45.

**5. Final Decision**
Total desired inventory is ~69-70 units. Starting inventory is 34.
Order = 35 or 36 units. Let's go with 36 to reach a round 70 total.

{
  "rationale": "Demand has consistently decelerated from the May peak (109 -> 69 -> 57), trending back towards the April baseline (~45). Lead time is 0. With 34 units on hand, we need to top up to cover potential lingering demand (approx 55-60) plus safety stock. A target level of 70 provides coverage for the recent P15 demand (57) with buffer, while acknowledging the downward trend.",

The downward momentum is slowing (-20, -12, -5), suggesting a potential floor is forming near 30-35 units. \n\nGiven the Profit/Holding cost ratio of 4:1 ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the optimal strategy is to service a higher percentile of demand (approx 80th percentile) rather than the mean. While the recent trend is strictly negative, ordering only for the current mean (~32-35) risks stockouts if demand reverts even partially to the long-standing baseline of 45. \n\nTherefore, we target a Total Inventory Position of 45 units.

This suggests a stabilization or 'floor' for Early Summer demand around 35-40 units, rather than a continued freefall. While current demand is below the April baseline (~44), the risk of understocking (cost $4/unit in lost profit) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) VM Action:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the comprehensive analysis below, here is the decision for Period 20.

### Rationale

**1. Demand Analysis & Trends:**
- **World Knowledge & Seasonality:** The date is late June (2019/6/24). The previous period (Period 19, mid-June) saw a massive, unexpected demand spike to 96 units, shattering the emerging "Early Summer" baseline of ~35 units. This suggests a potential mid-summer trend or a specific event-driven spike (possible end-of-season sales or summer fashion uptake).
- **Recent Pattern Shifts:** 
    - **May Peak:** Correlated with Mother's Day/Spring, demand hit ~100-109.
    - **June Lull:** Weeks 16-18 saw demand drop to the lowest levels yet (37, 32, 38).
    - **Current Shock:** Period 19 demand suddenly jumped to 96. This is a crucial signal. It mirrors the volatility seen in Period 12/13. It is risky to assume this is a one-off outlier given the product's history of "regime" shifts rather than single spikes (e.g., the high volume May regime lasted 3 weeks).
- **Regime Identification:** We are likely re-entering a high-volatility or high-demand regime similar to May. Averaging the low baseline (35) with the new spike (96) is dangerous if the spike represents a new "summer sale" sustained level. Conversely, ordering for 96 and seeing it drop to 35 incurs holding costs.
- **Forecast:** Given the sudden jump from ~38 to 96, I must hedge upwards. It is safer to miss slightly on holding cost than to stockout on 96 units of potential profit ($4 profit vs $1 holding). A conservative but responsive forecast would be to weight the recent spike heavily but acknowledge the low prior baseline. Let's obtain coverage for ~80-85 units to catch most of a sustained spike while mitigating total risk if it drops back to ~50.

**2. Supply Chain & Inventory:**
- **Lead Time:** Confirmed as 0 periods consistently (orders arrive same period).
- **Current Position:**
    - On-hand: 0 (Stocked out in Period 19).
    - In-transit: 0.
    - Pipeline Total: 0.
- **Needs:** We need to cover Period 20 demand entirely from this order.

**3. Cost/Benefit Analysis:**
- **Profit:** $4.00 per unit sold.
- **Holding Cost:** $1.00 per unit unsold.
- **Risk Profile:** The ratio (4:1) favors aggressive ordering to prevent stockouts. Losing a sale costs $4 in opportunity; holding a unit costs $1. We should aim to capture the upside of the recent 96-unit signal.
- **Calculation:** If demand repeats at 96, we need 96. If it reverts to the mean of the last 4 weeks ((37+32+38+96)/4 = ~51), we risk holding ~45 units. Cost of holding 45 units = $45. Cost of missing 45 sales (if we order 51 and demand is 96) = $180. The math strongly supports ordering closer to the recent high.

**4. Final Order Decision:**
I will target a service level close to the recent high (Period 19: 96). To be slightly conservative against a full regression to the mean but respectful of the 4:1 cost ratio, I will order **85 units**. This covers ~88% of the massive spike and provides ample buffer if demand settles midway between the lull and the peak (e.g., around 60-70).

{
  "rationale": "Period 19 saw a massive demand resurgence to 96 units, breaking the low-volume trend of early June (approx 35 units). With a 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the penalty for understocking is severe. Assuming the recent spike might indicate renewed summer demand or sales, I am ordering 85 units to capture the majority of this potential high volume while hedging slightly against a total reversion to the low 30s.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Summer volatility confirmed: Mid-June (Period 19) demand exploded to 96, interrupting the low-volume 'Early Summer' trend (~35).

While Period 21 covered the July 4th holiday week and demand remained high (80), it did not exceed the mid-June spike (96), suggesting the demand is driven by the summer season (fashion/weather) rather than just a specific holiday event.

[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the observation for Period 27 (2019/8/12), here is the step-by-step reasoning and final decision.

### Rationale

**1. Demand Analysis & Trends:**
*   **Regime Review:** The product went through a high-volume "Mid-Summer" peak (80-96) in late June/early July, crashed to a "Summer Slump" (34-39) in late July, spiked briefly in Period 25 to 56 (likely a momentary recovery or noise), and in the most recent period (P26), demand fell back to 36.
*   **Current Status:** The last few observations are 39, 34, 56, 36. The 56 appears to be an outlier or a brief fluctuation, given the return to 36 immediately after. The prevailing "Late Summer" baseline seems to be in the range of 35-40 units, similar to the "Early Summer" lull.
*   **Calendar Context:** Mid-August is typically a transition period. Retail often sees "Back to School" trends, but for a "Women's Hip Belt," demand might remain relatively flat or mild until fall fashion picks up. The historical data from Spring (April/May) suggested a baseline of around 45-50 before holidays. The recent drop to 36 suggests we are currently in a low-demand valley.

**2. Inventory & Pipeline:**
*   **Current On-Hand:** 32 units.
*   **In-Transit:** 0 units.
*   **Total Available:** 32 units.
*   **Lead Time:** Confirmed 0 periods. Orders placed now arrive today to satisfy today's demand.

**3. Forecast & Safety Stock:**
*   **Forecast:** The most robust recent signal is the low-volume cluster (39, 34, 36). The average of these three is ~36. The single spike to 56 pulls the 4-period average up to ~41. A conservative forecast is ~40-45 to avoid stockouts if the 56 signal repeats, but primarily trending towards the low 40s.
*   **Safety Stock:** Given the volatility manifested in Period 25 (spike to 56) and the high cost of lost sales vs. holding cost (4:1 ratio), we should target a total inventory level closer to the higher end of the recent range rather than the average. Aiming for a Service Level target of ~55-60 units covers the P25 spike while not overstocking aggressively if demand stays at 36.

**4. Order Quantity Calculation:**
*   **Target Level:** 55 units (This covers the recent spike of 56 almost entirely, and comfortably covers the average of ~41). Let's be slightly more aggressive to capture potential late-August recovery: Target 58.
*   **Current Inventory:** 32.
*   **Order Need:** 58 - 32 = 26 units.

**5. Final Decision:**
We will order 26 units. This brings total inventory to 58, providing a buffer against another random spike like Period 25 while respecting the prevailing lower trend of ~36.

{
  "rationale": "Current demand has reverted to the low-volume 'Summer Slump' baseline (observed 36 in P26), confirming the spike in P25 (56) was likely transient. However, given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, we must protect against volatility. Recent low cluster avg is ~36. We target a stock level of roughly 58 to cover the P25 max (56) plus a tiny margin, balancing the risk of stockout against the recent downward trend.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Late Summer demand remains volatile but low: P26 (36) confirms P25 (56) merely interrupted the slump seen in P23-P24 (39, 34). Baseline forecast effectively ~35-40 with potential for random upward variance.",

Period 28 (2019/8/19) VM Action:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current state and historical data, here is the decision rationale:

### 1. Rationale

**A. World Knowledge & Product Analysis**
The product is a "Flora hip belt," a fashion accessory. We are in late August (2019/8/19). The "Summer Demand Regime" (Period 19-21) is definitively over. Historical patterns suggest late summer (August) settles into a stable but lower volume baseline before potentially picking up for Fall. The recent demand fluctuations indicate high volatility but a low mean.

**B. Demand Regime Analysis**
*   **Recent History:**
    *   **Mid-Summer Peak:** P19-P21 (~89 avg).
    *   **Summer Crash:** P22-P24 (53 -> 39 -> 34).
    *   **Attempted Recovery:** P25 saw a spike to 56 (resulting in a stockout).
    *   **Relapse/Stabilization:** P26 dropped to 36, and P27 dropped further to 30.
*   **Current Trend:** The brief recovery in P25 appears to be an outlier or a specific event spike. The last two periods (36, 30) strongly suggest we have returned to the "Early Summer/Low" baseline of ~30-35 units.
*   **Forecast:** Expect demand to remain in the 30-40 range for the immediate future.

**C. Lead Time & Pipeline**
*   **Lead Time:** Consistently 0 periods. Orders arrive in the same period they are placed, ready for demand.
*   **Stockouts:** None recently (P25 was the last one).

**D. Inventory & Pipeline Assessment**
*   **Current On-Hand:** 28 units.
*   **Target Inventory:** Given the volatility (P25 spiked to 56 unexpectedly), aiming for coverage of ~45-50 units is safer than adhering strictly to the recent low average of 33. This provides a buffer against another random spike while not overstocking significantly if demand stays at 30.
*   **Gap Calculation:**
    *   Target: 50 units (Safety stock for potential mild recovery/volatility)
    *   Current: 28 units
    *   Needed: 22 units.

**E. Final Order Logic**
Demand in the last two weeks (36, 30) averages 33. On-hand is 28. If we order 0, we risk stocking out if demand is even slightly above average (e.g., 30). Buying up to a target of ~50-55 protects against the P25-style spike (56) while maintaining low holding costs if demand is essentially flat.
*   Order = Target (55) - Current (28) = 27 units. Rounding to 30 for safety.

However, looking at the pattern, P25 (56) was followed by P26 (36) and P27 (30). We are holding 28. If demand is ~35, we need 7 more. If demand spikes to ~50, we need 22 more.
Let's order enough to hit a comfortable "high-normal" level.
55 (Target) - 28 (On Hand) = 27.

### 2. Carry-Over Insights
"Late Summer stabilization confirmed: After a brief spike in P25 (56), demand has settled back to the low-volume baseline of ~30-35 units (P26:36, P27:30). High-volume regimes appear finished for the season."

======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical data, here is the decision rationale and forecast for Period 30.

### Rationale

**1. World Knowledge & Product Context**
*   **Date:** September 2, 2019. It is Labor Day in the US. This usually signals the end of summer and the start of full fall retail patterns.
*   **Seasonality:** The "Flora hip belt" has shown high sensitivity to seasonal shifts and holidays (e.g., Mother's Day, mid-Summer).
*   **Calendar Event:** Labor Day is a significant retail holiday, often driving increased foot traffic and sales. The spike in the previous period (Period 29, late August) likely reflects pre-holiday shopping or back-to-school wardrobe updates.

**2. Demand Regime Analysis**
*   **Recent Trend:** August demand was oscillating (bimodal) between ~30s and ~50s, but **Period 29 exploded to 83 units**. This is a massive deviation from the August average.
*   **Comparison:** This spike mirrors the pattern seen in May (Mother's Day) and June/July (Summer peak), where demand jumped suddenly to ~90-100 range.
*   **Current State:** We are likely in a mini-peak driven by Labor Day. History suggests post-holiday demand often tapers but doesn't crash instantly to zero; however, the previous August baseline was low (~30-50).
*   **Forecast:** The demand of 83 in Period 29 suggests high momentum. Given it's Labor Day week itself, demand could remain elevated or start to taper. A rigorous safety stock is needed because the penalty for stockouts ($4) is high compared to holding ($1). A "safe" forecast assumes demand might stay high (near 60-70 range) or revert slightly, but we must cover the upside risk of another 80+ week.

**3. Inventory & Pipeline Assessment**
*   **Current On-Hand:** 0 units (Stockout occurred in Period 29).
*   **In-Transit:** 0 units.
*   **Pending Arrivals:** None visible (ordered Period 30 arrives in Period 30).
*   **Lead Time:** Consistently 0 periods. We can order now for immediate arrival to satisfy Period 30 demand.

**4. Final Order Logic**
*   **Target Inventory:** Given the stockout at 60 units last week against a demand of 83, we are severely under-stocked if we stick to the old baseline.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Maximum risk scenario: Demand repeats ~83 units.
    *   Moderate scenario: Demand tapers to recent high average ~55-60.
    *   Cost trade-off: Missing a sale costs $4. Holding a unit costs $1. We should aim for a higher percentile of demand (approx 80th percentile).
*   **Decision:** To be safe against another spike like P29 (83 units) and considering the high profit margin and holiday week, I will target **85 units**.
*   **Order Quantity:** Target (85) - On-Hand (0) = 85.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) VM Action:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical patterns, below is the rationale and decision for Period 43.

### **Ration**
**(a) World Knowledge & Product Description:**  
The date is **December 2, 2019**, which corresponds to **Cyber Monday** and the first full week of December shopping. The previous period (P42) covered Black Friday week and showed a massive demand jump to **135 units**, confirming the end of the pre-holiday lull and the start of the chaotic holiday peak season. Accessories like this belt are prime gift items and stocking fillers, so demand is expected to remain high or volatilely oscillate at high levels throughout December.

**(b) Demand Regime Analysis:**  
The "Pre-Holiday Lull" (Nov avg ~31 units) ended violently in P42 with **135 units** of demand\u2014a **4.3x increase** from the prior mean. This mimics the explosive recoveries seen earlier in the year (e.g., P12-P13 Mother's Day spike). The SKU has now entered its "Holiday Peak" regime. Historical peak behavior suggests sustained high volume (often 100+ units) or high variance. We cannot safely revert to the October baseline of ~70; we must forecast for continued peak activity (100-135 range) to avoid stockouts during the most profitable weeks of the year.

**(c) Lead Time & Inventory Pipeline:**  
Lead time remains reliably **0 periods**.  
Current On-Hand: **12 units**.  
This is critically low following the heavy sales of P42.

**(d) Safety Stock & Final Order Logic:**  
*   **Forecast:** Given P42 was 135 units (Black Friday), P43 (Cyber Monday week) is likely to be similarly strong. Conservatively estimating demand to sustain around the **100-120** unit level, but recognizing it could spike higher.
*   **Target Inventory:** To cover a potential repeat of 135 units plus a safety buffer for volatility (aiming for ~140-150 total coverage), we need significant stock. The cost of stocking out (opportunity cost of lost profit) far outweighs the holding cost of $1/unit, especially during this short peak window.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Target Coverage: ~150 units (Aggressive holiday stance).
    *   Current Inventory: 12 units.
    *   Order Need: 150 - 12 = 138 units.
    *   Rounding to a safe high number: **135 units** to match the known peak.

The strategy is "chasing the peak." It is safer to slightly overstock now and hold inventory into January than to miss sales in the critical weeks of December.

{
  "rationale": "Black Friday (P42) confirmed the expected breakout with demand hitting 135 units (4x previous avg). Entering Cyber Monday week (P43), demand will remain in the high-volume Holiday Peak regime (est. 100-140 units). Start-of-period inventory is critically low (12). Ordering aggressively to cover likely sustained peak demand.",

This 67-unit demand aligns perfectly with the Oct baseline (avg ~69), confirming that the pre-holiday lull (Nov, ~30s) is over and we are in active holiday mode. While the 135-unit spike was an event outlier, demand in the weeks leading up to Christmas (Dec 9-23) often swells, potentially testing the high-90s levels seen in May (P12-13) and late Sept (P34). Current on-hand inventory is 80 units. This barely covers the mean demand (67) with a thin safety margin. Given the high cost of stockouts ($4 profit vs $1 holding) and the likelihood of a pre-Christmas demand surge (potential for 85-100 units), relying on existing inventory is too risky. I will target a total inventory position of ~120 units to comfortably cover upside volatility typical of the final gifting push.",
