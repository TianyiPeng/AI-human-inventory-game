Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1, date: 2019-02-11. We have historical demand samples provided in the game instructions (Jan 7 to Feb 4). The item is a 'Flora hip belt'. Recent demand samples are: 41, 59, 44, 49, 53. The mean of these 5 samples is 49.2 and the standard deviation is approx 7.15. There is no clear trend up or down. Since this is the first decision period and we have a small but stable history, I will use 'default' methods which calculate based on all available history (the 5 samples). The promised lead time is 0 periods. No arrivals have been observed yet to calculate actual lead time, so I will stick to the default promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision. Observed Period 1 demand (72) was significantly higher than the historical average (~49), causing a stockout. Lead time held consistent at 0 periods. To address the apparent upward trend/spike in demand while recovering from the stockout, we adjust mu_hat to rely on the most recent 3 periods (average ~58 vs long-term ~53). High critical fractile (0.8) justifies chasing recent demand to prevent further lost sales. Sigma uses recent_N=6 to include the new high-variance data point in volatility estimates. L remains default (0) as promise holds.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25). Demand has shown a strictly increasing trend over the last 5 observations (44 -> 49 -> 53 -> 72 -> 150), with a massive spike in Period 2 resulting in stockouts. The actual lead time remains reliable at 0 periods (same-day arrival). Given the stockouts and the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit-to-holding ratio), we must increase the forecast significantly to catch up with the realized demand levels (average of P1+P2 is 111 vs historical 49). We select 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to weigh the recent surge (150, 72, 53) heavily while capturing the high volatility introduced by the Period 2 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend confirmed: 5 consecutive periods of increase (44->49->53->72->150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date 2019/3/4. Demand in Period 3 (78 units) broke the sharp upward trend seen in Period 2 (150 units), though it remains significantly above the January average (~50 units). The Period 2 spike to 150 may have been an isolated event (e.g., mid-Feb seasonality). Current inventory is 57. Lead time remains consistently 0 (immediate arrival). I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to smooth the 150 spike while maintaining a forecast (avg ~80.4) close to the most recent observation (78), acknowledging the new higher but volatile baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend broken/stabilized: Period 3 demand (78) halted the sharp growth trend (peak 150 in P2) but confirms a new elevated baseline compared to Jan avg (49). High volatility persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand in Period 4 (48 units) dropped back to the January pre-spike average (~49), suggesting the February demand surge (peak 150) was a temporary seasonal event (likely Valentine's driven). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 (averaging 78 and 48) to approximate 63, which balances the return to baseline with a slight buffer. I retain a high safety stock by setting sigma_hat with recent_N=4 to capture the extreme volatility of the last month (std dev ~44), ensuring resilience if demand fluctuates again. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand return to baseline confirmed in Period 4 (48 units vs Jan avg ~49), ending the Feb spike. Volatility remains elevated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (March 18). Demand in Periods 4 and 5 (48, 53) has stabilized near the pre-game January average (~49), confirming the end of the February spike (peak 150). While the immediate trend suggests a mean ~50, we select a 3-period rolling window (N=3) for parameters. This includes Period 3 (78) in the calculation, resulting in a slightly higher mean (~60) and variance forecast than N=2 would. This conservative approach buffers against potential volatility or minor upward fluctuations, protecting the high service level requirements (CR=0.8) while transitioning securely back to the baseline regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Stable baseline sustained: March avg (P4-P5) is 50.5, matching Jan avg (~49), confirming Feb spike has fully dissipated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (late March). The February demand spike (Periods 1-3) has fully dissipated. The current 'March regime' (Periods 4-6) shows a stable but slightly rising demand pattern (48 -> 53 -> 60), with an average of ~53.7, which is slightly above the pre-game (Jan) baseline of 49. Inventory is low (14 units) relative to expected demand. We select parameters based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to accurately reflect this post-spike baseline without pollution from the high-variance February data. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: March demand shows mild upward drift (48->53->60), establishing a new post-spike baseline average of ~54 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1) begins with 0 inventory and 0 in-transit following a stockout in Period 7 where demand reached 68. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand analysis shows a distinct upward trend over the last 3 periods (53 -> 60 -> 68), deviating from the early March stable baseline of ~50. This growth suggests a seasonal shift for April rather than random noise. To capture this rising trend without being skewed by the extreme February outlier (150), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. This focuses the forecast on the immediate growth trajectory (avg ~60.3) while keeping safety stock proportionate to recent volatility rather than historical extremes.

Carry-over insight: Late March trend intensification: 3 consecutive periods of growth (53->60->68) indicate a shift from the stable ~50 baseline to a ~60+ level for early April.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Period 8 demand (45) significantly dropped from Period 7 (68), breaking the 3-period upward trend observed previously. This confirms that the recent growth was likely volatility rather than a sustained regime shift. The demand has returned to levels consistent with the post-spike baseline established in early March (P4: 48, P5: 53). Given the high holding cost ratio (25% of profit), avoiding reaction to false trends is critical. I am switching to a 5-period moving average (P4-P8) for both mean and volatility to smooth out the noise (range 45-68) and capture the stable baseline of ~55 units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Trend break confirmed: Period 8 demand (45) halted the upward drift (peak 68), suggesting earlier growth was variance. 5-period average stabilizes at ~55.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April). Demand has stabilized significantly after the volatile Feb-March fluctuations. The last two periods (P8, P9) showed demands of 45 and 46 respectively, which is extremely consistent and aligns with the pre-spike January levels (~49). The upward drift seen in late March (60->68) appears to have fully corrected. Current on-hand is low (17) but lead time is reliable (0 periods observed consistently). I will switch to a recent_N=4 strategy for both mean and variance to capture this new stability (post-P5 data) while discarding the extreme volatility of late Feb/early March (periods 2-3). This focuses the forecast on the current stable regime of ~45-55 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: April demands (45, 46) mark a return to lower volatility and consistent volume after March fluctuations.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: April 22, 2019. Demand has stabilized significantly in April (Periods 8-10: 45, 46, 39), with an average of ~43.3 units, which is slightly lower than the January/March baselines (around 50). The high volatility seen in February and late March has subsided. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the stable recent history and lack of upcoming major holidays in late April, I will use a short-term average (recent_N=3) for demand to capture this dip in consumption without overreacting to the older volatility. Lead time uses 'default' as it matches the promised 0 periods perfectly.

Carry-over insight: April stabilization confirmed: Demand in Periods 8-10 (avg ~43) is lower and less volatile than March (avg ~57).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12 (April 29). Demand has stabilized in April (P8-P11) with an average of ~43.5 units and low volatility (range 39-46), a significant drop from the March average of ~57. However, on-hand inventory is critically low (3 units). While the April regime (N=4) suggests a lower target, relying solely on it risks stockouts if demand fluctuates upward slightly. Therefore, I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This includes the tail of the March high demand (P7=68), effectively buffering the forecast (avg ~48.4) and volatility estimate to rebuild safety stock slightly above the strict April baseline without overreacting to the Q1 peaks. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (Apr 29) concluded with a significant demand spike to 101 units, causing a stockout. This event abruptly ended the stable, low-demand regime observed throughout April (avg ~43 units). Given the product (Accessories/Belt) and the date (May 6), this spike likely signals the onset of seasonal demand or increased volatility rather than a pure anomaly. With valid lead time consistently at 0 periods, I am setting L to 'default'. For demand parameters, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5. This window (last 5 periods: 45, 46, 39, 44, 101) incorporates the recent stability while allowing the new spike to lift the mean (to ~55) and significantly increase the volatility estimate (Standard Deviation), ensuring the base stock reacts to the risk of higher demand without fully over-pivoting to a single data point.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: April stable regime (avg ~43) broken by sudden demand spike to 101 units (+135%), indicating return of high volatility or seasonal shift.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 demand (109) confirms the high-volume regime established in Period 12 (101), pushing the 2-period average to 105, which is >2x the April baseline (~43). While this spike correlates with the run-up to Mother's Day (May 12), the cost asymmetry (Ratio 4:1 profit/holding) dictates defending against stockouts if this is a sustained seasonal shift (Summer) rather than anticipating a post-holiday crash. Since 'recent_N' enforces N>=3 (diluting the signal with low P11 demand), I use 'explicit' mu_hat=105 to reflect current volumes. Sigma uses N=3 to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Periods 12-13: High demand regime confirmed (avg 105 vs prior 43), coinciding with Mother's Day (May 12). Future periods must monitor if this is a temporary holiday peak or a sustained seasonal summer baseline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) follows the Mother's Day peak. Demand in Period 14 (69) dropped significantly from the holiday highs of P12-P13 (105 avg), confirming the event-driven nature of the spike. However, demand remains elevated above the April baseline (~43), suggesting a potential transition to a higher summer seasonal baseline for accessories. OR parameters use recent_N=5 to blend the pre-holiday baseline, the holiday peak, and the post-holiday cooling; this results in a mean forecast (~72) that closely aligns with the most recent observation (69) while the high volatility in the 5-period window generates sufficient safety stock to protect against demand staying elevated.

Carry-over insight: Mother's Day demand spike (P12-P13 avg 105) subsided in P14 (69 units), signaling a correction. However, P14 demand (69) remains elevated compared to April average (~43), indicating a potential shift to a higher summer seasonal baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has corrected from the Mother's Day peak (109->69->57). We use N=2 to focus solely on the post-peak normalization phase (avg 63, std ~8.5), excluding the Period 13 outlier to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining coverage for demand settling near 55-60.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Consecutive declines (109->69->57) suggest a return to the March baseline (~55) rather than a sustained high summer volume, invalidating the earlier high-demand hypothesis.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (June 3). The Mother's Day holiday peak (Periods 12-13) has fully dissipated. Demand has shown a consistent downward trend for 3 periods (69 -> 57 -> 37), with the most recent observation (37) falling slightly below the pre-holiday average of ~45-50. This confirms a return to baseline or a post-holiday lull. To avoid overstocking based on the obsolete May spikes, we switch to a short-memory estimation (N=3) for both mean and volatility. This sets the forecast around ~54 units with moderate volatility, balancing the risk of the recent low (37) being noise against the clear normalization trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalization confirmed: P16 (37) completes a 3-period slide (69->57->37) returning to or dipping below the pre-holiday baseline (~45). Volatility decreasing.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 18 (June 10). Lead time consistently 0 periods. Demand has continued its downward trajectory post-Mother's Day, dropping to 32 units in Period 17, which is below the pre-holiday April baseline (~43). This suggests a transition into a lower-volume summer season for this accessory. While the most recent activity (37, 32) averages ~35, I am electing to use N=3 (P15-P17: 57, 37, 32; Avg=42) to maintain a slight safety buffer against volatility, preventing an over-correction that might lead to stockouts if demand fluctuates back to the 40s. Current on-hand (36) is sufficient for immediately expected demand, but restocking to the N=3 level ensures service levels are met.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-volume regime likely: Demand has dipped (37->32) below the spring baseline (~43), suggesting a seasonal lull.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 demand (38) and Period 17 (32) confirm a lower summer baseline compared to the spring average. The 2-period average is 35 units, showing low volatility. The Mother's Day spike is well in the past. Current on-hand is 16, which is below the expected demand of ~35, risking stockout if not replenished. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We will maintain the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this new lower, stable summer regime (avg ~35-37) while still being reactive if demand picks up slightly towards end of June.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed stable around 35 units (P17: 32, P18: 38), significantly lower than spring levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24) follows a significant demand spike in Period 19 (96 units), which shattered the low-volume baseline of the prior 4 weeks (avg ~41). This spike mirrors the magnitude of the May event (P12-P14, avg ~93), suggesting the product has entered another high-demand cluster, possibly driven by end-of-June summer sales. Relying solely on the recent lull (P15-P18) would cause severe understocking. We adopt a broader N=8 window to incorporate the May spike data, recognizing the bimodal nature of the summer demand (alternating between ~40 and ~100). This sets a target inventory (approx 92) sufficient to cover repeated high demand while acknowledging the risk of sudden drops.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand spike to 96 units (+150% over prior week) confirms return of high-volatility regime similar to May, breaking the mid-June lull. Product exhibits bimodal summer demand behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1). Demand in late June (P19: 96, P20: 82) has sustained a high-volume regime significantly above the early June lull (avg ~35). This suggests a 'summer sale' or seasonal peak similar to the Mother's Day spike. With on-hand inventory critically low at 12 units and a high critical ratio (0.8), the system must order aggressively to prevent stockouts. I am switching to 'recent_N=3' for demand parameters to focus on this new high-activity cluster (38, 96, 82) while discarding older, irrelevant low-demand data. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: Late June demand (avg 89 for P19-P20) is ~2.5x the early June baseline, establishing a bimodal summer pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8). The summer high-demand regime has sustained for a 3rd consecutive period (P19: 96, P20: 82, P21: 80, Avg ~86), significantly above the early June baseline (~35). While historical spikes in this SKU (Feb P1-3, May P12-14) often corrected after 3 periods, suggesting a risk of demand dropping back to ~40-50 soon, the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) dictates we must defend against lost sales rather than minimize inventory. We adopt a responsive forecast (mu_hat recent_N=3) to track the current elevated volume and a higher volatility estimate (sigma_hat recent_N=5) to buffer against the ongoing regime instability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike duration warning: Previous major spikes (Feb, May) lasted exactly 3 periods before correcting downward. Current summer spike has now reached 3 periods (P19-P21), signaling high probability of imminent reversion to lower baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand (53 units) confirmed the end of the high-demand summer spike (P19-P21 avg ~86), validating the 3-period duration hypothesis seen in Feb/May. Demand has reverted towards a moderate baseline. Forecasting mu=53 (explicit) to align with this most recent correction signal rather than averaging the now-irrelevant spike data. Sigma set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the broader volatility of the season (~26), ensuring a safety stock buffer (target ~75) against uncertainty while avoiding excessive overstocking as volume cools.

Carry-over insight: Summer spike reversion confirmed: Period 22 demand (53) ended the 3-period high-volume regime (P19-P21), consistent with prior volatility patterns. Demand expected to stabilize between 35-55 units.

Given the established pattern of 3-week spikes followed by reversion, we anticipate demand to remain in the 35-45 range for the immediate future. We set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to exclude the high spike values and align with the current lower trend. However, we retain a wider window (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the high recent volatility, ensuring adequate safety stock (Service Level ~80%) in case of another sudden fluctuation.

Carry-over insight: Summer spike reversion verified: Demand (P23: 39) has stabilized near the early June baseline (~36), confirming the end of the P19-P21 high-volume regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29) continues the stable summer baseline observed since Period 23. The high-volatility spike witnessed in late June (P19-P21) has definitively ended, with demand settling back to ~36 units (P23=39, P24=34). This matches the early June baseline (P17=32, P18=38). We are currently in a low-demand regime typical for late summer for this accessory. On-hand inventory is healthy (32 units) relative to the recent mean (approx 36), so massive replenishment isn't needed, but we must maintain availability. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to tightly track this revived low-volume baseline (avg ~42, pulled up slightly by P22's 53, but stabilizing). Sigma will track recent volatility to handle minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 23-24 avg ~36.5 units, marking a return to the early June baseline after the late June spike.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August, a transition time for fall fashion accessories. Period 25 demand (56 units) broke the short mid-July lull (avg ~36.5) and caused a stockout (5 units lost sales). This +55% demand jump suggests the start of a new regime or seasonal upswing. Given the high profit-to-holding ratio (4:1), avoiding stockouts is critical. I am expanding the estimation window to N=5 (which includes the tail of the late June spike and the current rise) to establish a more robust safety stock buffer (~52 unit mean with higher variance) against the anticipated August volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand resurgence confirmed: Demand rose to 56 units (+55% vs P23-24 avg), breaking the mid-July lull and causing a stockout. This volatility likely signals the onset of August/Autumn seasonal demand patterns.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (Aug 12). Demand in Period 26 dropped back to 36 units, invalidating the previous theory that Period 25 (demand 56) signaled the start of a sustained seasonal increase. The product has returned to the 'lull' baseline of ~35-40 units seen in mid-July. However, given the history of sudden volatility (spikes in Feb, May, June) and the high cost of lost sales relative to holding (4:1), we cannot be too aggressive in cutting inventory. We select N=5 for estimation to capture the recent 'calm' periods while still including the moderate volume of P22 (53) and the spike in P25 (56) to maintain a safety buffer against noise. Lead time performance remains excellent (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: False alarm on trend shift: Demand immediately reverted to the low baseline (36 units) in Period 26, suggesting the Period 25 spike (56 units) was isolated volatility rather than the onset of an August seasonal regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Aug 19 (Period 28). Demand in Period 27 (30 units) reinforces the ongoing summer low-volume regime (roughly 33-35 units) identified in previous periods, dipping slightly below the P26 level. The spike in P25 appears to be an isolated outlier or 'false alarm' as P26-P27 have reverted to stability. Given the high profit margin (CR=0.8), we maintain a safety buffer by including the P25 spike in our estimation window (N=4) rather than ignoring it, ensuring the sigma estimate protects against potential early autumn volatility while checking the mean near the stable 35-40 range. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Low-volume stability deepened: Period 27 demand (30) dropped below the prior maintenance level (~36), reinforcing the summer lull regime (approx 33-35 units) despite mid-August date.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 demand (54 units) spiked significantly above the prior period (30), repeating the pattern seen in Period 25 (56 units). This confirms an oscillating demand regime (Low-Low-High) rather than a stable lowseason. The previous 'low-volume' assumption led to stockouts in P25 and P28. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 ratio vs holding), we must defend against the ~55 unit peaks. We select 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture both recent spikes (P25, P28) in the mean and variance, biasing the inventory level higher to prevent further lost margin.

Carry-over insight: Oscillating demand regime confirmed: P23-P28 exhibits a repeating 'Low-Low-High' pattern (approx. 30, 30, 55), significantly increasing volatility and invalidating the prior stable summer baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 covers Labor Day (Sept 2), a major retail event. The demand surge in Period 29 (83 units) mirrors the pre-Mother's Day pattern observed in Period 13 (109 units), suggesting P29 was the pre-holiday shopping peak. Consequently, demand in Period 30 may correct downward or stabilize rather than continue the sharp linear ascent. However, the transition to Autumn suggests a baseline higher than the summer lull (30-35 units). We use 'recent_N' with N=3 to blend the recent peak (83) with the prior rising trend (30, 54), producing a balanced forecast (mean ~56) that allows for a moderate post-holiday dip while maintaining enough safety stock (via high recent volatility) to cover a sustained high baseline if the season dictates. L remains default (0) as delivery is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Labor Day seasonal peak identified: Period 29 demand (83) mirrors pre-holiday spikes seen in May (P13), signaling a likely post-holiday correction in Period 30, though Autumn baseline is expected to remain above summer lows.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (60 units) shows a correction from the Labor Day peak of 83 (Period 29) but remains significantly elevated above the summer baseline (~35 units). The demand pattern P28-P30 (54, 83, 60) represents a distinct active high-volatility regime compared to mid-August. We select recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to rely exclusively on this new post-summer activity cluster, discarding the lower demand data from Period 27 and prior. This sets a target inventory that protects against lingering autumn volatility while acknowledging the downward correction from the holiday peak. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Labor Day correction confirmed: Demand dropped from peak 83 (P29) to 60 (P30), marking the end of the holiday spike. However, the post-holiday level (60) is nearly double the summer baseline (~35), suggesting a transition to a higher volume Autumn regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (mid-September): Demand has stabilized at a new, higher Autumn baseline following the Labor Day peak. P30 (60) and P31 (65) averages 62.5, which is significantly higher than the summer average of ~35. The pattern indicates the holiday spike (83 in P29) was a transition point into this higher volume regime rather than a temporary anomaly. Current on-hand inventory is low (14 units). To maintain service levels in this new elevated regime and account for recent volatility, we use a short N=3 average for demand (capturing the recent high-volume cluster: 83, 60, 65) and N=5 for volatility to reflect the transition period's fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Post-Labor Day demand has settled at a high plateau (avg 62.5 units for P30-P31), effectively doubling the summer baseline (~35). This breakdown of the summer lull suggests sustained higher volumes for the fall season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 corresponds to late September. The 'Autumn demand regime' identified in previous periods persists, though Period 32 (50 units) shows a slight cooling compared to the immediate post-Labor Day weeks (60, 65). The 3-period average is ~58 units, significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~35. Given the critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), preventing stockouts is the priority, especially since volatility remains evidenced by the spike in P29 (83). We utilize recent_N=4 for both demand and volatility parameters to capture this 'Elevated Autumn' transition window (avg ~64.5) rather than reverting to long-term averages that are diluted by summer lows. Lead time operates reliably at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline refinement: Period 32 demand (50) brings the post-Labor Day average (P30-P32) to ~58 units, confirming a stable regime ~65% higher than summer lows (~35), with moderate volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory (17) is critically low covering only ~0.3 periods of demand, requiring immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed: Period 33 (60 units) reinforces the Sep avg of ~59 units, validating the sustained step-up from summer lows (~36).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 demand spiked to 92 units (+53% vs P33), significantly breaking the stable September plateau of ~60 units and causing a stockout. This occurred in early October, likely signaling the onset of Q4 seasonal volatility or a demand shift (similar to the June bimodal pattern). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the priority is to rapidly adapt to avoid further stockouts. I am switching to a short-memory estimation (N=3) for both mean and variance. This weighs the recent 92 observations heavily, raising the stocking target to better cover potential sustained high demand while accounting for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand spike to 92 units (+53% vs prior weeks) shattered the recent Autumn plateau (~60), indicating a return to high volatility or onset of Q4 peak season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 14 (Period 36). Demand in Period 35 (72 units) remained significantly higher than the early September baseline (~60), though lower than the Period 34 spike (92). This pattern confirms a shift to a higher-volume Autumn/Pre-Holiday regime. Early September stability (avg ~59) has been replaced by a higher mean (~82 over P34-P35) and increased volatility. A stockout occurred in P34 due to this surge. To maintain the high service level (Profit >> Holding Cost) and avoid further lost sales, we adopt a reactive forecasting approach using the most recent data points. Lead times remain reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand intensification confirmed: Period 35 demand (72) remained elevated above the early-Sep baseline (~60), confirming the Period 34 spike (92) signaled a regime shift to higher volume (avg ~82 units for last 2 periods) rather than a temporary anomaly.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Demand in Period 36 (67 units) and Period 35 (72 units) suggests the Autumn regime is stabilizing around ~70 units, retreating from the Period 34 spike (92) but staying well above the early September baseline (~59). The demand trend appears to be consolidating at this higher level consistent with the season. I selected recent_N=3 (avg ~77) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the elevated volume of the last 3 weeks without diluting the forecast with lower early-September data. With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 / ($4+$1)), maintaining higher availability is preferred over risking stockouts. Lead time reliably remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Demand in Oct (P35-P36) stabilizing around ~70 units, cooling from the late-Sep spike (92) but remaining significantly above the early-Sep baseline (~59).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Oct 28. Demand in October has stabilized remarkably, forming a tight plateau around ~69 units (P35:72, P36:67, P37:69). This confirms a new sustained Autumn baseline distinctly higher than September (~60) and Summer (~35). The high carry cost ratio (Profit $4 / Holding $1) favors a high service level (~80%). Given the stability over the last 3 weeks following the P34 spike, I am using a 5-period window to capture the shift from late September into the October stability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: October stable plateau confirmed: Demand has held steady between 67-72 units for 3 consecutive weeks (P35-P37), establishing a firm pre-holiday baseline ~70 units, roughly 15-20% higher than early September.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/11/4 (Period 39). The recent stable plateau observed in periods 35-37 (avg ~70) was interrupted by a significant drop in Period 38 to 41 units (a 40% decrease). This mirrors the pattern seen in May and late June where a high-volume regime suddenly reverts to a lower baseline before potentially spiking again. Given it is early November, this dip is likely the 'calm before the storm' of Black Friday/Holiday Q4 sales. The Autumn baseline has been generally robust (~60-70), but this specific drop needs to be accounted for without overreacting, as Q4 volatility is high. I will use a weighted average (EWMA 0.4) to capture the stable plateau while allowing the recent low demand to temper the forecast slightly, avoiding overstock if the dip persists, but maintaining readiness for holiday spikes. L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Q4 Pre-Holiday Dip: Demand dropped sharply to 41 in Period 38 (vs Oct avg ~69), signaling potential volatility or a temporary lull before Black Friday; Q4 baseline remains fragile.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) sees a drastic demand contraction (P39: 25 units), the lowest of the year, signaling a pre-holiday lull as consumers await Black Friday. While October averaged ~69 units, the immediate trend is sharply down. Given the high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), blindly holding October-level inventory is creating waste. I am switching to 'recent_N=3' (avg ~45) to reflect this lower pre-holiday baseline while remaining ready for a rebound. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Pre-Holiday Lull confirmed: Demand plummeted to yearly low of 25 in Period 39 (vs Oct avg ~69), strongly suggesting consumer wait-and-see behavior before Black Friday sales (late Nov).

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 confirmed the pre-holiday lull (demand 29), but with Black Friday (Nov 29) approaching in Period 42/43, Period 41 is a critical inflection point. Similar to the Mother's Day pattern (Period 11 lull -> Period 12 spike), Period 41 represents the potential start of the holiday ramp-up (~1.5 weeks prior). Relying solely on the lull (N=3) risks a massive stockout if demand surges early. Given the 4:1 Profit/Holding ratio, the cost of understocking the holiday onset far outweighs holding costs. Therefore, I am using N=5 to blend the recent lull data (P38-P40) with the higher October baseline (P36-P37). This increases the mean estimate and, critically, inflates the variance (sigma), generating a larger safety stock buffer to capture potential early holiday demand while not fully committing to a spike if the lull persists one more week.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Holiday Lull confirmed: Demand in early Nov (P38-P40) averaged ~32 units, significantly below the Oct baseline (~69), mirroring the pre-Mother's Day lull (P11) before the major spike.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 is the week of Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019). The carry-over insights correctly identified a deep pre-holiday lull (P39-P41 avg ~30 units) leading into this week. Based on earlier major holidays (e.g., Mother's Day P13 peak of 109 units following a lull), demand is expected to spike significantly this week. The 'Autumn' baseline was ~70 units, but holiday peaks can reach ~2x baseline. Given the low on-hand inventory (26), aggressive replenishment is required to cover the expected holiday surge. I will use 'explicit' forecasts for demand to model this known calendar event, targeting a peak volume similar to or exceeding the May high (approx 100-110 units) to avoid stockouts during the critical sales week. Volatility (sigma) is also set explicitly higher to account for uncertain holiday magnitude.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday Seasonal Alert: Pre-holiday lull (P39-P41 avg 30) ended; Period 42 coincides with Black Friday week, expecting major demand spike consistent with prior holiday patterns (e.g. May peak ~109).

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Black Friday) delivered a massive demand spike of 135 units, confirming the end of the November lull and the onset of the Q4 holiday peak. Period 43 corresponds to early December (Cyber Monday week), where demand historically remains elevated rather than reverting immediately to baseline levels (e.g., Summer peak P20-P21 stayed high). To capture this regime shift and discard the irrelevant low-volume data from mid-November, we set N=2 for demand estimation. This uses only the ramp-up (P41: 38) and the spike (P42: 135) to forecast, resulting in a significantly higher mean and volatility estimate (Avg ~86.5) appropriate for the gift-giving season. This aggressive stance balances the high stockout cost ($4) against holding risk ($1) during the year's busiest weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Black Friday spike verified (135 units, +255% vs P41). This confirms the end of the pre-holiday lull and the start of the Q4 high-volume regime. Volatility has spiked drastically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (67 units) confirms that the extreme Period 42 spike (135 units) was a specific Black Friday event. The current demand level has returned to match the stable October baseline (average ~69-70), which we interpret as the sustained 'Holiday Shopping' demand rate for December (approx 70 units/week). We reject using a simple average of recent periods because it includes the artificial pre-holiday lull (P39-P41) and the BF spike. Instead, we use 'explicit' forecasting to target this ~72 unit baseline. We maintain 'recent_N=3' for volatility to keep safety stock elevated, accounting for the recent instability (lull -> spike -> correction). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization confirmed: Demand corrected from 135 (P42) to 67 (P43), aligning with the October baseline (~70). This establishes a 'December Holiday' plateau significantly above the November lull, expected to persist until Christmas.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final full shopping week before Christmas. Demand in Period 44 (80 units) increased from Period 43 (67 units), confirming an intensifying 'Holiday Plateau' significantly above the November lull. Given the high cost of stockouts (ratio 0.8) and the likelihood of peak demand this week, we select 'recent_N' with N=3 (Periods 42-44: 135, 67, 80). This window captures the Black Friday peak and the subsequent high-volume plateau, resulting in a high mean (~94) and high variance to effectively buffer against the expected pre-Christmas surge.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Christmas demand intensification: Period 44 demand (80) rose vs Period 43 (67), suggesting the Holiday Plateau is trending upward as December 25th approaches.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the week of December 23 (Christmas). We are observing the tail end of the holiday shopping season. While Period 44 suggested intensification (80 units), Period 45 cooled significantly to 62 units, indicating the peak may have passed or demand is fluctuating around a 'Holiday Plateau' of ~70 units. With on-hand inventory at 63, we face a stockout risk if demand hits the plateau average (69.6). Since lead time is 0, we can replenish instantly. We apply a short-memory forecast (N=3) to capture this specific post-Black Friday, pre-Christmas holiday regime (P43-P45), balancing the risk of last-minute sales against an imminent post-holiday drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak cooling: Period 45 demand (62) dropped from Period 44 (80), refuting the upward intensification trend and suggesting the holiday rush is tapering off. A plateau average of ~70 units persists.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to December 30th, the immediate post-Christmas week. Historical context and general retail patterns suggest a sharp drop in demand as holiday shopping concludes (New Year's demand is typically lower for accessories). Recent demand has stabilized around ~61-62 units (Periods 45-46) after the Black Friday/Holiday peak. The prior expectation of a surge through Dec 25th has passed. We expect a 'Post-Holiday Hangover' where demand drops significantly, potentially returning to the pre-season or summer baseline (~35-45 units) or the early Autumn baseline (~60 units). Given the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), stocking out is expensive, but holding excess inventory is also undesirable as we exit the peak season. The most recent demand was 61. I will set parameters based on the recent post-peak plateau (last 4 periods excluding the spike outlier, or just the recent cooling trend) but lean conservative as we enter January. The average of the last 3 periods (Period 44-46) is roughly 68 units, with a downward trend (80->62->61). I will treat the last 2 weeks (avg 61.5) as the new short-term baseline for the inter-holiday week, with safety stock covering volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday contraction signals: Demand stabilized at ~61-62 units for P45-P46 (down from peak 135/80), indicating the end of the holiday rush and a return to the Autumn baseline levels.
