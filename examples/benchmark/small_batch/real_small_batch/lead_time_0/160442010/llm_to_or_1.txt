Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start (2019-02-11). Product is '3p Sneaker Socks'. The historical data provided (Jan-Feb 2019) shows fairly stable demand ranging from 54 to 84 units, with a slight upward trend recently (70, 72 in the last two samples). The average over the provided 5 history points is 67.2. Since this is the first decision period, we have no observed lead time history yet, so we trust the promised lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Standard base-stock logic applies: Demand is stable enough to use the recent history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand estimation to capture the recent level effectively while smoothing slightly. Promised lead time is 0, so L=0. Sigma will be estimated from the 5 historical points.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18). Demand in Period 1 was 81, which is high but consistent with the historical max of 84 from early Jan. The observed lead time confirmed the promised 0 periods (P1 order arrived in P1). Given the noisy demand history (range 54-84) and small sample size, I am using 'default' for all parameters to utilize the full historical dataset for mean and standard deviation calculations, ensuring robust inventory coverage (approx 80 units) against the service level target.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 witnessed a massive demand spike to 199 units, nearly triple the historical average of ~70, causing a significant stockout. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the priority is to recover inventory levels rapidly to meet potential heightened demand, which may be driven by seasonal transitions (late February heading into spring for sneaker socks). Lead time remains reliably 0. I am switching to a short-term 'recent_N=3' forecast for both mean and volatility to incorporate the recent spike immediately while balancing it against the prior two weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 context: Current on-hand is 0 due to persistent stockouts. Demand analysis indicates a massive regime shift starting in Period 2 (199 units) and continuing in Period 3 (245 units), compared to the historical baseline of ~70 units. The previous forecasts significantly underestimated this new demand level. Stockout cost (Profit $4) outweighs holding cost ($1) significantly (ratio 4:1), justifying an aggressive response. To capture this new high-demand plateau and avoid further lost sales, I am switching to a very short memory (N=2) for demand parameters, utilizing only the data from the surge (Periods 2 & 3). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Periods 2-3: avg demand surged from ~75 to ~222 (+196%).

Daily Profit: $528.00, Daily Holding Cost: $118.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (March 11) continues the spring season for sneaker socks, a category sensitive to warmer weather. While demand dropped in Period 4 (132) compared to the February surge (199, 245), it remains double the pre-season baseline. This volatility (range 132-245) coupled with a high critical ratio (0.8) necessitates a responsive policy. We use 'recent_N=3' for both demand and volatility to capture the current high-activity spring regime without over-indexing on the single cooling signal in P4. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18, 2019. Demand in Periods 4 and 5 (132, 136) has stabilized at an intermediate level (~134 units), which is significantly lower than the spike in Periods 2-3 (~222 units) but higher than the start of the game. I select recent_N=3 for mu_hat to transition smoothly, adhering to the minimum N=3 rule which blends in the high P3 demand, providing a safety buffer against recurrence. I use a longer horizon (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility observed over the last month. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Periods 4-5 avg ~134 units (drop from P2-P3 peak ~222). Volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $900.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand rebounded strongly to 243 units, effectively mirroring the high demand peaks seen in Periods 2 and 3 (199, 245) and reversing the lower volume trend observed in Periods 4-5 (~134 avg). This volatility indicates a robust but erratic Spring season for Sneaker Socks. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit-to-holding ratio) and the lead time of 0, minimizing stockouts is key. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to define a regime that captures both the peaks (~245) and the troughs (~132), resulting in a higher safety stock than the P4-P5 lull suggested. Lead time (L) remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring volatility confirmed: Period 6 demand (243) invalidates the stabilization signal from Periods 4-5; demand has returned to the high-variance regime of Periods 2-3 (avg ~229).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has surged significantly in Periods 6 and 7 (avg 272.5), aligning with spring seasonality for sneaker socks. The temporary dip in P4-P5 is no longer representative. To avoid stockouts (critical ratio 0.8), I am switching to a tight N=2 window to chase the upward trend (243 -> 302). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring surge confirmed: Periods 6-7 avg demand ~272.5, significantly outpacing P4-P5 plateau (avg ~134).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1232.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8th) context: 'Sneaker Socks' are in peak seasonal demand as weather warms. Demand data P6-P8 (243, 302, 343) shows a strong, consistent upward trend (+59, +41 units period-over-period). Stockouts have occurred in the last 3 periods, indicating undersupply. A simple moving average of the last 3 periods (~296) lags significantly behind the most recent realized demand (343). Therefore, I am using an explicit forecast of 350 for mu_hat to capture the continuing seasonal ramp-up and mitigate lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 0. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the volatility of the current surge.

Carry-over insight: Spring surge intensifies: P6-P8 demand reflects strong seasonal ramp (243->302->343), far exceeding early March levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $647.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April) continues the Spring season for 'Sneaker Socks'. While Periods 6-8 showed a strong growth trend (ending at 343), Period 9 saw a sharp correction to 208 units. Despite this drop, the average demand of the active spring regime remains high. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 margin ratio) and the potential for demand to bounce back to P8 levels (343), we maintain a robust inventory target. We select mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg ~284) to smooth the recent dip against the prior peaks, and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the significant volatility observed over the last month (~60 units std dev). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand correction observed; volume dropped to 208 (-39% vs P8 peak), signaling high volatility within the high-volume spring regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1340.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, well into the Spring season for 'Sneaker Socks'. Period 10 demand hit a new record (361 units), recovering sharply from the Period 9 dip (208 units). This confirms that the Period 9 drop was volatility rather than a trend reversal. The 5-period average (Periods 6-10) is ~291 units with high standard deviation. We are currently stocked out (0 on hand) after missing sales in P10. We continue to assume Lead Time = 0 based on consistent delivery performance. We select 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture this specific 'Spring Surge' regime (P6-P10) which is characterized by high volume and high volatility. This sets a base stock that accounts for recent peaks while acknowledging the variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 10 demand (361) sets new record, confirming P9 dip (208) was volatility, not cooling. Spring mean (last 5 wks) holds strong at ~291 with high variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: April 29, 2019. The product (sneaker socks) continues to see strong spring demand. 

We are in a high-demand, high-volatility regime. Period 11 demand was 392, confirming the upward trend is intact despite the dip in Period 9. The last 6 periods (P6-P11) show demands of: 243, 302, 343, 208, 361, 392. This averages ~308 units/period with significant variance. The most recent observation (392) is the highest yet, suggesting we have not yet hit the seasonal peak or it is plateauing at a high level. 

Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. We stocked out in P11 (demand 392 > stock 347). This lost sales opportunity (45 units) underscores the need to be aggressive with inventory targets in this high-growth phase. 

Lead Time: Consistently 0 periods. No drift detected. 

Parameter Selection:
- L: 'default' (0 period promised).
- mu_hat: 'recent_N' with N=3. The most recent 3 periods (P9, P10, P11) are 208, 361, 392. Average = 320.33. This captures the high volatility while weighting the recent surge. Using a longer window dampens the trend too much given the rapid rise.
- sigma_hat: 'explicit'. The volatility is extreme. Std dev of last 3 is ~97. Std dev of last 6 is ~70. Given the cost ratio (4:1 profit:holding), stockouts are expensive. I will set explicit sigma_hat = 100 to ensure a robust safety buffer (z-score*sigma) covers the heavy right tail of demand.

Carry-over insight: Spring peak continues to escalate: Period 11 demand reached 392, exceeding previous high. Average of last 3 periods is ~320, confirming sustained high volume.

Spring demand is strong and sustained. Demand for the last 3 periods averages ~374 units (361, 392, 369). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to react fast to this high plateau, and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility (including the dip in P9). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand plateau identified: Periods 10-12 indicate a sustained high-volume plateau averaging ~374 units/week, recovering fully from the P9 dip.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 14 (2019/5/13). Context: We are in mid-May, typically peak season for sneaker socks. Historical demand shows high volatility with a strong upward trend from March through late April, but Period 13 saw a significant dip to 267 units (down from the ~370-390 peaks of P11-12). This 267 is still much higher than early season data but breaks the recent plateau pattern. Lead Time: Consistently 0 periods. Forecast: Given the volatility (P9 dipped to 208 then rebounded to 361), trusting the dip in P13 entirely is risky. However, including P13 in the average moderates the forecast slightly. The 5-week average (P9-P13) captures the volatility well: (208+361+392+369+267)/5 = 319.4. A shorter 3-week average (P11-13) yields 342. Using a recent_N=5 approach balances the high peaks (P11, P12) with the dips (P9, P13) to avoid overreaction while maintaining high service levels (ratio 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand volatility confirmed: Period 13 demand dropped to 267 (-28% vs P12), echoing the P9 dip pattern; high-variance regime persists around a mean of ~320.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) represents the onset of the summer season for 'Sneaker Socks'. Recent demand in P13 (267) and P14 (262) shows a noticeable dip (-28%) compared to the P10-P12 peak (avg 374), echoing the pattern observed in P9 (208) which was followed by a sharp surge. Given the high Critical Ratio (0.8) and the seasonal relevance of the product, treating this as a permanent decline is risky. Instead, I interpret it as continued high volatility. I am selecting N=5 for estimation (avg ~330) to bridge the recent dip with the prior peaks, ensuring sufficient stock if demand rebounds as it did post-P9. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring volatility deepens: Consecutive drops in P13 (267) and P14 (262) establish a lower short-term floor (~265) after the ~374 peak plateau, but high variance suggests this may be temporary noise rather than a seasonal end.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (May 27) represents the onset of summer. Product 160442010 (sneaker socks) is highly relevant for this season. Demand in Period 15 (308 units) rebounded from the dip in P13-P14 (avg ~265), indicating that the seasonal demand remains strong and volatile rather than collapsing. While the April peak (~374 avg) has cooled, the average over the last 5 periods (~320) captures the mix of high peaks and recent volatility better than a narrower window. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we use recent_N=5 to maintain a service level that covers potential spikes back toward the 350 range. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May demand rebound: Period 15 demand (308) ended the brief dip seen in P13-14 (avg ~265), suggesting the true seasonal plateau for early summer is likely in the ~280-320 range with continued high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1480.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to early June (2019-06-03), a peak season for sneaker socks. The most recent demand signal (Period 16) was 383 units, a significant jump from the previous 260-300 range, confirming that the spring/summer high-volume regime is active and potentially accelerating. Historical volatility is extremely high (peaks of ~392, dips to ~208), making reactivity critical. The current on-hand inventory is 0, so stockouts are impacting profit immediately. Given the recent rebound (P15: 308, P16: 383), demand is averaging ~296 over the last 4 periods, but the trend line suggests pushing toward the upper bound of that range again. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the plateau, dip, and recovery) to center the mean around ~320 while keeping variance high to buffer against stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed: Period 16 demand (383) validates the upward trend returning to April highs, suggesting June will sustain high volume (>350 unit potential).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) falls in the high-demand summer season for sneaker socks. Demand in Period 17 (282) dropped significantly from Period 16 (383), continuing a well-established 'sawtooth' pattern of high volatility where sharp dips are typically followed by immediate rebounds (e.g., P9: 208 -> P10: 361). A 3-period average (N=3) captures the high-volume context (Mean ~324) better than a longer horizon (N=5 Mean ~300) which would be dragged down by the P13/P14 lull. Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit/Holding ratio 4:1) and the likelihood of a rebound in P18, N=3 ensures sufficient base stock to cover potential spikes back to the ~380 level while accounting for the high observed variance (~52 std dev). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility pattern defined: High mean (~324, last 3 wks) maintained despite sharp oscillating weekly variance (e.g., P16 383 -> P17 282); dips are noise, not trend reversals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-06-17 (Mid-June). We are fully in the summer regime. The last few periods show demand oscillating around a high mean: P16=383, P17=282, P18=280. The average of the last 3 periods is ~315, and the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~303. This confirms the summer plateau predicted in previous insights (~280-320 range), with high variance still present. The product (invisible sneaker socks) is highly relevant for summer footwear. Given the high variance (std dev ~40-50), and the stockout in P16, we should maintain a robust safety stock. On-hand is 89, which is low compared to expected demand (>300). Lead time is consistently delivering same-period (0 actual). I will use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the current oscillating plateau level (~315) quickly without overreacting to the slight dip in P17/18, and calculate lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau confirmed: June weeks (P16-18) average ~315 units, consistent with the predicted 280-320 range; high variance persists.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June): Product enters peak summer season with a confirmed demand plateau. Over the last 4 periods (June, P16-P19), demand has averaged ~312 units (range 280-383). The earlier spring volatility (April/May) has settled into this high-volume regime. Given the 4:1 Profit-to-Holding cost ratio, we prioritize service level but focus on the recent June stability rather than older spring data. 'recent_N=4' accurately captures this current summer plateau profile. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/7/1 (Period 21). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', highly relevant for summer. We are now in July. Demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has been: 383, 282, 280, 301, 280. The average is ~305 units. The variance remains high, with spikes historically reaching near 400. The observed pattern is a stable 'summer plateau' around 300 units, significantly higher than winter/early spring averages. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We have 73 units on hand. To maintain service levels in this high-demand season and protect against upward variance (peaks ~380), we will use a recent_N=5 estimator for both mean and volatility, capturing the active summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau stability: Weeks P17-P20 show remarkably consistent demand averaging ~286 units (range 280-302), confirming a stable summer volume tier slightly below the P16 peak (383).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand dropped significantly to 198 units, a 31% decrease from the previous stable average of ~286 (periods 17-20). This period (July 1-7) coincides with US Independence Day, suggesting the dip may be a temporary holiday anomaly rather than a permanent seasonal shift. Given the high cost of stockouts (CR=0.8) and the history of rapid rebounds (e.g., post-Period 9), relying solely on the latest data point is risky. We select N=6 for both mean and volatility estimation to smooth the P21 dip with the robust demand from June (P16-P20), maintaining a target stock level capable of handling a potential rebound to ~300+ units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Significant demand dip to 198 disrupts summer stability (prev avg ~286). Likely holiday effect (July 4th) or increased volatility; expecting potential rebound.

Current date is July 15 (Period 23). The significant dip observed in Period 21 (July 4th holiday) extended into Period 22 (209 units), failing to rebound to the June average of ~286. This suggests a potential mid-summer demand cooling. However, given the high cost of lost sales ($4) versus holding cost ($1), aggressively cutting inventory based on only two data points is risky. A sudden return to June levels (280+) would be costly if inventory is set too low. Therefore, we use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility. This blends the robust June performance with the recent July lows (Avg ~254), maintaining a safety buffer in case of a rebound while acknowledging the downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer cooling persists: Post-holiday rebound failed to materialize in Period 22 (209 units), establishing a lower 2-week average of ~204 units compared to June's ~286.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22): Demand has shifted into a sustained lower regime ('Mid-summer Slump') for 3 consecutive weeks (P21: 198, P22: 209, P23: 188). The average for this new period is ~198 units, a sharp drop (-30%) from the June average of ~286. The P21 drop was not a one-off holiday anomaly. With observed lead time consistently 0, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to tightly track this new lower mean. I set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the recent downward step-change, ensuring a safety buffer in case of a rebound.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer Slump confirmed: Periods 21-23 show sustained lower demand averaging ~198 units (vs June avg ~286), indicating the seasonal peak has passed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29 (Period 25). Demand has entered a steep decline characterized as a 'Mid-summer Slump', dropping from an average of ~198 in early July to just 109 in Period 24\u2014the lowest level since the game started. This sharp drop (-42% week-over-week) suggests a seasonal trough or 'clear-out' phase before potential Back-to-School demand later in August. Despite the downtrend, the cost of stockouts ($4 margin) outweighs holding costs ($1) by 4:1, so we must avoid over-correcting to the single low point of 109. We use a short 3-period rolling window for mu_hat and sigma_hat (~169 mean) to capture the cooling trend while maintaining enough safety stock to cover a potential rebound to the ~170-200 range. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer Slump intensifies: Period 24 demand plummeted to 109 (-42% vs P23), marking the lowest volume since February and confirming a deepening seasonal trough.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (early August). The Mid-summer Slump identified in Periods 24-25 has solidified. Demand has dropped dramatically from the June peak (~300) to a new low regime: P24=109, P25=121 (avg ~115). This aligns with the end of the summer season for 'sneaker socks' before back-to-school or fall demand potentially picks up. Given the sharp drop (-60% from peak), using recent history is critical to avoid overstocking based on the old high-volume regime. The most relevant signal is the last 2-3 periods. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 periods to capture this new low baseline (avg ~140, trending down). Volatility is moderate relative to the mean, so recent_N for sigma is also appropriate. I must prevent inventory bloat as demand cools further.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer Slump stability: Periods 24-25 confirm a new low-volume regime averaging ~115 units, a massive drop from the ~300 unit summer peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (Aug 12): 'Mid-summer Slump' regime persists. Demand for the last 3 periods (P24-P26) averaged ~120 units (109, 121, 131), significantly lower than the ~200+ seen earlier. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am switching mu_hat to recent_N=3 to tightly track this lower baseline (~120). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture some transition volatility (~45) rather than just the very tight recent variance (~11), providing a safety buffer against unexpected late-summer variance. Inventory (45) is critically low against expected demand (~120+), necessitating an immediate order.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer slump stability confirmed: Periods 24-26 demand averaged ~120 units, establishing a firm low-volume floor (range 109-131) entering late August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 corresponds to late August. Demand has firmly settled into a low-volume 'mid-summer slump' regime, with the last 4 periods (P24-P27) averaging ~114 units, significantly down from the seasonal peak. Period 27 established a new low at 95 units. Given the consistency of this drop (observed for 4+ weeks), we adopt a responsive N=4 for forecasts to prevent overstocking during this trough. Promised lead time remains reliable at 0 periods with no missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer slump deepens: Period 27 demand (95) set a new season low, solidifying a depressed regime avg of ~114 units (last 4 weeks). No signs of Back-to-School recovery yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 represents late August. While Back-to-School timing suggests a potential demand recovery, the observed data shows a deepening slump with no uptick yet (Period 28 demand hit a season low of 80). The persistent low-volume regime starting Period 24 (avg ~107 units/week) is the dominant signal. We adopt mu_hat/sigma_hat 'recent_N=5' to align inventory with this depressed baseline, avoiding excess holding costs from irrelevant spring/early-summer peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer Trough intensifies: Period 28 demand (80) marks a new seasonal low. The 5-week average has stabilized at ~107 units, confirming a deep slump compared to earlier peaks, with no Back-to-School recovery currently visible.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (Sept 2) confirms the transition to an Autumn Baseline. Demand over the last 3 periods (P27-P29) averaged ~88 units, essentially returning to the low-volume levels observed at the start of the year (Jan/Feb avg ~67 units). The seasonal 'sneaker sock' peak is over. We adopt a short N=4 observation window for demand parameters to reflect this stabilized low-volume regime (avg ~99 units) and avoid overstocking based on July's transition data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Baseline established: Periods 27-29 average ~88 units, mirroring the pre-season winter baseline (Jan avg ~69). Impact of seasonal cycle appears complete as product enters low-demand months.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sep 9) confirms the 'Autumn Baseline' regime is stable. Demand in periods 25-30 has settled into a lower volume range (average ~102 units, recent low ~89) compared to the summer peak. Although recent weeks (P27-P30) averaged ~90 units, demand shows a slight uptick (80->88->96). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding cost ($1), a conservative approach balances the risk. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand and volatility to include the transitional values from late July (P25/P26 used as a buffer), ensuring sufficient stock (target ~120) to cover potential fluctuations back toward the ~110-130 range without excessive overstocking.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Sep 16 (Period 32). Demand remains firmly in the 'Autumn Baseline' low-volume regime established around Period 27/28. Over the last 5 periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged ~88 units with low volatility (range 79-96), showing no signs yet of a seasonal recovery. The product (Sneaker Socks) appears to be in an off-peak season compared to the spring highs. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We continue to use recent_N=5 for demand parameters to tightly track this stable, low-volume plateau.

Demand has stabilized in a low-volume autumn regime (avg ~83 units over last 5 weeks). High-variance spring/summer data is now obsolete. Switching to short-memory recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to optimize for this calmer, lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Stabilization: Periods 28-32 confirm a stable low-volume regime averaging ~83 units, consistent with the product's off-season (sneaker socks in colder months). Volatility has compressed significantly compared to spring/summer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sep 30). Demand in Period 33 unexpectedly surged to 183 units (+154% vs P32), breaking the stable low-volume autumn trend (avg ~83). This spike sharply contrasts with the pre-season winter baseline (Jan avg ~69) and the recent Sep avg (~80). Given the product is 'sneaker socks' (often worn with trainers, potentially seeing a late-season burst or clearance effect, or perhaps weather-related), this sudden jump requires an immediate reaction to prevent stockouts, as P33 ended with 0 inventory and lost sales. The 5-week average has risen to ~103, but the most recent observation is double the prior trend. To be safe against a sustained shift or another spike, I will switch to a short-memory estimator (N=3) which captures the spike (mean ~111) while balancing against the previous lows. I am increasing volatility estimation significantly to account for this rupture in stability.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in Period 33: Demand jumped to 183 (from ~80 baseline), disrupting the stable autumn low-volume regime. Monitoring for new regime or one-off outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (October 7). The product remains in its off-peak Autumn season. The massive demand spike in Period 33 (183 units) was immediately followed by a sharp drop in Period 34 (50 units), confirming P33 was an isolated outlier or anomaly rather than a regime shift. The underlying demand trend appears to be cooling further as the season deepens (Period 34 demand of 50 is a new historical low, below the previous ~80 baseline). However, given the high stockout cost relative to holding cost (4:1) and the demonstrated potential for volatility, I will use a 5-period horizon for parameters. This captures the P33 spike in the standard deviation (increasing safety stock) and pulls the mean (~96) slightly above the recent median to protect against unexpected fluctuations, while recognizing the generally low seasonal volume.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility/outlier confirmed: Period 34 demand (50) reversed the Period 33 spike (183), indicating P33 was an anomaly. The low-volume autumn regime persists (baseline ~70-90) but shows signs of further cooling as deep autumn sets in.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 corresponds to mid-October, deepening the off-season for Sneaker Socks as weather cools. Demand pattern P34 (50) and P35 (43) confirms a new 'Deep Autumn' cooling trend, significantly lower than the previous ~80 unit baseline. The spike in Period 33 (183) is now confirmed as an outlier/anomaly given the immediate return to low volume. Using 'recent_N' with the required N>=3 would force inclusion of the Period 33 outlier, artificially inflating mean to ~92 and sigma to ~80, which would lead to severe overstocking ($1 holding cost is significant). Therefore, I am using 'explicit' parameters derived from the last 2 representative periods (P34-P35) to filter the noise and align inventory with the specific ~47 unit demand level. Current on-hand (97) provides strong coverage, allowing a natural destocking.

Carry-over insight: Deep Autumn Cooling confirmed: Periods 34-35 average ~47 units, establishing a new lower baseline below the early autumn level (~83 units) and confirming Period 33 as an outlier.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 21 (Deep Autumn). Demand for sneaker socks has stabilized at a low seasonal baseline following the Period 33 outlier. The last three periods (P34-P36) show consistent low volume (50, 43, 51; avg ~48), significantly below the early autumn levels (~83). Given the clear seasonal trend (colder weather reduces demand) and the high holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), it is optimal to rely strictly on the most recent, lower demand signal to avoid overstocking. Selecting N=3 for demand and volatility parameters effectively excludes the P33 anomaly and captures the current stable trough. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Deep Autumn stability confirmed: Period 36 demand (51) maintains the low-volume baseline established in P34-35 (avg ~48 units), solidly confirming the lower seasonal tier compared to September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (late October) continues the 'Deep Autumn' low-volume regime for sneaker socks. Demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) has been remarkably stable (50, 43, 51, 53), averaging ~49 units with very low volatility. This confirms the seasonal trough for this product category as colder weather sets in. The P33 outlier is now excluded. Inventory is at 0, requiring immediate replenishment. I am using 'recent_N=4' for both mean and volatility to target this tight, consistent baseline of ~50 units while minimizing holding risks ($1/unit).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/11/4 (Period 39). The product is in its off-season 'Deep Autumn' regime. Demand in the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged ~52 units, filtering out the anomalous spike in Period 33. While the mean is low compared to summer peaks, the last two periods (P37, P38) resulted in stockouts, with demand climbing slightly (53 -> 62). To stabilize the service level and prevent further lost sales while avoiding overreaction to the P33 outlier (now 6 periods ago), we use recent_N=5. This window captures the true low-volume seasonal baseline (P34-P38) while incorporating the recent slight uptick in demand.

Carry-over insight: Deep Autumn stability confirmed: Periods 34-38 avg ~52 units. However, recent stockouts in P37/P38 suggest the absolute floor may be closer to 60 units than 40, requiring tighter inventory control despite the low season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is deep autumn/early winter. Sneaker socks are an off-season product with stable low demand. Demand for the last 6 periods (excluding the Period 33 outlier) has averaged ~50 units/week with low volatility (std dev ~7). Recent stockouts in P37/P38 were due to variance (demand up to 62) against tight inventory, but Period 39 (43 units) confirms the baseline has not shifted upwards. We use recent_N=6 to capture this stable post-outlier regime (P34-P39). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Deep Autumn baseline confirmed: Periods 34-39 avg ~50 units, stabilizing after P33 outlier. Range 43-62 units indicates mild volatility but no upward trend yet despite approaching holidays.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (mid-November). The product remains in the 'Deep Autumn' low-volume regime established around Period 34. Demand over the last 7 periods (P34-P40) averages ~51 units with mild volatility (range 43-62). Recent stockouts (P37, P38) and a near-stockout in P40 (ending inventory 1) highlight that while volume is low, variance is significant relative to the mean. We continue to use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu and sigma to capture this full window of stability (post-P33 outlier), ensuring the volatility estimate (sigma) is robust enough to buffer against the upper bound of recent demand (e.g., P38's 62 units) given the high cost of lost sales. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) falls on Black Friday week. While the recent 'Deep Autumn' baseline (Periods 34-41) is stable at ~50 units/week, major retail events typically drive significant demand multipliers even for off-season staples like sneaker socks. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit 4.0) versus holding costs (1.0), and the known capacity for this SKU to volume spike (e.g., Period 33), I am explicitly setting a forecast of 80 units (+60% lift) with increased variance to buffer against stockouts during this high-traffic promotional window.

Carry-over insight: Deep Autumn baseline maintained: Periods 34-41 avg ~50 units (range 43-62), confirming stable off-season demand prior to holiday weeks.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 falls on Dec 2 (Cyber Monday week), following a confirmed Black Friday demand spike in Period 42 (140 units, +180% over baseline). This marks the definite end of the Deep Autumn low-volume regime and the start of the Holiday season. While the Period 42 spike creates high volatility, demand is expected to remain elevated compared to the ~50 unit baseline through December. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both demand and volatility. This setting incorporates the recent spike (140) and the prior baseline (56, 44) to produce a moderate mean forecast (~80) but a very high standard deviation (~52), resulting in a high safety stock buffer (Service Level-driven Base Stock ~165+) to protect against Cyber Monday surges without fully overfitting to a single peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season onset confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 140 units (Black Friday week), nearly tripling the prior autumn baseline of ~50. This marks the transition from Deep Autumn to the high-volatility Holiday regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). The holiday season is active. We just witnessed a severe volatility event. Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw a massive spike to 140 units, but Period 43 immediately crashed to 24 units. This extreme oscillation (140 -> 24) suggests demand is highly erratic and event-driven rather than a smooth trend. The product (sneaker socks) is less seasonal in winter compared to summer, but gift purchasing creates noise. Despite the crash in P43, we must prepare for potential last-minute holiday shopping spikes (mid-December) before the post-holiday slump. The Deep Autumn baseline was ~50. I will switch to an EWMA smoothening to balance the recent extreme noise while staying responsive to any pre-Christmas surges, rather than reacting solely to the P43 drop. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme Holiday Volatility Confirmed: Demand oscillated violently from 140 (P42 Black Friday) to 24 (P43), indicating highly unpredictable purchasing patterns rather than a sustained high-volume holiday plateau.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) is the final shipping week before Christmas. Recent history shows extreme volatility: P42 spike (140) followed by a deep crash in P43-44 (avg ~21.5). This crash drops well below the previous autumn baseline (~50), suggesting a dead zone for 'Sneaker Socks' in winter. However, historical data from Jan 2019 (avg ~67) indicates a likely rebound in the coming weeks. To balance the risk of a pre-holiday 'last minute' spike and the upcoming January recovery against the current lull, we use recent_N=3. This captures the P42 volatility in the variance calculation, keeping safety stock high enough to buffer potential demand shocks, while the mean (~61) bridges the gap between current lows and January historicals. Current on-hand (82) is healthy, but this setting ensures we don't stock out if demand reverts to historical norms.

Carry-over insight: Winter Crash confirmed: Post-Black Friday demand plummeted to ~22 units (avg P43-44), significantly below the autumn baseline of ~50, likely due to seasonality of sneaker socks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Demand has stabilized at a deep winter trough of ~23 units/week (avg of P43-P45). The Black Friday spike is fully passed. With 93 units on-hand, we are well-stocked. We switch to recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this specific low-volume winter regime and ignore the earlier autumn volatility and Black Friday outlier.

Carry-over insight: Winter Trough stability: Periods 43-45 demand (24, 19, 26) averages ~23 units, confirming a stable, deep winter low-volume regime following the singular Black Friday spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to the week including Dec 30th (New Year's week). Demand in Period 46 stabilized at 25 units, confirming the deep winter trough observed since Period 43 (avg ~23.5 units). The massive Black Friday spike (P42, 140 units) is now a distant anomaly. The product (sneaker socks) is in its off-season, consistent with the pre-season baseline seen in Jan 2019 (avg ~69, though currently even lower). With 68 units on hand, inventory coverage is robust (~3 weeks of demand). I will maintain the recent_N method with a small window (N=4) to capture this low-volume stability while ignoring the P42 distortion, ensuring we don't overstock during the transition into January. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter Trough confirmed stable: Periods 43-46 avg ~23.5 units, establishing a persistent low-demand baseline for the off-season.
