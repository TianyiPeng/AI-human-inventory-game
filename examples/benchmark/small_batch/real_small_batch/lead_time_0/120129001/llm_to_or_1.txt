Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Relying on pre-game historical data for 'Babette long' maternity leggings (Jan-Feb 2019 samples suggest mean ~66, std ~19). Demand shows moderate volatility (range 48-94). With a high service level target (critical fractile 0.8), the default policy balances the risk of stockouts against holding costs appropriately. Assuming promised lead time of 0 holds for the initial order.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18) context: Demand volatility is significant (range 48-94 over known history), but lead time is confirmed reliable at 0 periods (Period 1 order arrived immediately). Current on-hand inventory (19) is critically low relative to the average demand (~65). With a high critical ratio (0.8), avoiding stockouts is prioritized. I am utilizing 'recent_N' with N=6 to include the full set of provided historical data (5 points) plus the valid Period 1 observation, establishing a robust baseline for mean and volatility to stabilize the base stock calculation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 begins with 0 inventory after a stockout in Period 2 (demand 88, sold 80). Promised lead time is 0 and actual performance consistently matches this (L=0 observed in P1 and P2). Demand is volatile (ranging from 49 to 94 in the last 5 periods), so we use a 5-period rolling window for both mu and sigma to capture this variance without overreacting to the single spike in Period 2. The order will replenish to a level capable of handling high-demand fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 context: On-hand inventory is low (4 units). Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 periods in Periods 1-3. Demand in the last two periods (88, 84) shows an uptick compared to Period 1 (63) and late historical data (49), though high volatility is known (historical peak 94). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to align with the recent high demand level (~78 avg). For sigma_hat, I use a 5-period window to capture the full volatility range (49-94) to ensure the safety stock (CritFractile=0.80) is robust enough to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently confirmed as 0 periods (P1-P3 observations). Demand showing recent upward trend (P2-P3 avg 86 vs P1 63).

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11). Current observation: On-hand is 19. All previous orders (P1-P4) arrived with 0 lead time (same period), confirming lead_time=0 logic remains stable. Demand history for periods P1-P4 is 63, 88, 84, 76. The average demand is ~78. The pre-game history suggests a similar range (avg of last 5 historical: ~66, but max was 94). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, though demand is slightly higher than the earliest historical samples. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (integrating recent high points like 88 and 84) while damping noise. Sigma will follow suit to capture recent volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as observations consistently match promised.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 6. Demand analysis shows a sustained high regime from P2-P5 (values: 88, 84, 76, 85) with an average of ~83.3 units, significantly higher than P1 (63) or the pre-game average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, target service level ~80%), we prioritize service. For mu_hat, we use recent_N=4 (P2-P5) to accurately reflect the current high demand level. For sigma_hat, we use recent_N=5 (P1-P5) to include the P1 volatility; this results in a wider standard deviation (~10.1) compared to just the stable recent period (~5.1), generating a healthier safety stock buffer (target inventory ~92) to protect against demand spikes like P2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level ~83 units (P2-P5) vs lower P1/pre-game levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (Mar 25). Status: On-hand 10, In-transit 0. Demand for maternity leggings remains high and stable (Last 5 periods: 88, 84, 76, 85, 82). The average of the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is 83 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~66). Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. 

Given the item is a maternity legging and demand is very stable around 83 units, I will continue to use a recent_N strategy for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime without being dragged down by older, lower data points. With L=0, we only need to cover the current period's demand. The standard deviation of recent demand (P2-P6: 88, 84, 76, 85, 82) is quite low (stdev ~4.6), suggesting low volatility. 

Plan:
- L: Explicit 0 (confirmed consistently).
- mu_hat: recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand plateau (~83 units).
- sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) to capture the current tighter variance compared to the erratic start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1) marks a potential pivot. After a stable high-demand regime from Period 2-6 (avg ~83 units), Period 7 demand dropped sharply to 54 units. This observation aligns closer with pre-game volatility (Jan avg ~65) than the recent high streak. Given the service-critical nature (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, CR=0.8), we must protect against stockouts while acknowledging the demand dip. We maintain the Lead Time at 'default' (0 periods) as it remains consistent. For demand (mu) and volatility (sigma), we select 'recent_N' with N=5. This window (Periods 3-7) captures the tail end of the high regime plus the recent significant drop, effectively lowering the forecast mean slightly (to ~76) while increasing the variance estimate to buffer against uncertainty in this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift signal: Period 7 drop to 54 ends stable high streak (avg ~83 in P2-P6). Volatility increased, suggesting return to pre-game irregular patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9 (Apr 8). Inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 8 where demand reached 94 (exceeding the 88 units available). This 94-unit demand signal counters previous concerns about the P7 drop (54 units), suggesting high volatility rather than a demand collapse. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the stockout risk and high variance (range 54-94 in last 2 periods) while maximizing profit (critical ratio 0.8), we switch to a short-memory N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent instability immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 8 rebound to 94 proves Period 7 dip (54) was variance, not a trend change. High-demand regime persists (avg ~78) but with significantly widened spread.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 10 (April 15). Lead time remains consistently 0. Demand pattern has shifted from a stable high regime (P2-P6 mean ~83) to a highly volatile oscillating regime (P7-P9: 54, 94, 57) with a lower average (~68) but significantly higher variance. P9's drop to 57 confirms this instability. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit) vs holding ($1), we prioritize service level. We set 'mu_hat' with N=8 (mean ~77.5) to anchor the forecast in the broader season's activity and avoid over-reacting to the lower recent average. We set 'sigma_hat' with N=3 to capture the immediate volatility spike (std dev ~22 vs historical ~4), buffering safety stock to cover demand swings up to ~96 units.

Carry-over insight: Volatile demand regime confirmed: Period 9 (57) continues the erratic pattern (P7-P9: 54, 94, 57). While the mean of this recent block (~68) is lower than the prior stable period (~83), the standard deviation has increased roughly 5x (from ~4.5 to ~22).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (Late April). Lead time remains reliably 0 (instant). Demand has shifted distinctly since Period 7. The previous stable high regime (P2-P6, avg ~83) has been replaced by a lower, more volatile regime in P7-P10 (sequences: 54, 94, 57, 51). The average of these last 4 periods is ~64, with high standard deviation (~20) driven by the oscillation between 50s and the spike to 94. Continued low demand in P10 (51) suggests the P8 spike was an outlier or volatility rather than a return to the high mean. Adapting parameters to `recent_N = 4` discards the older, higher stable data to prevent overstocking, while maintaining a high sigma estimate to buffer against potential recurring spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 7-10 confirm a new lower-mean, high-volatility block (Avg ~64, StdDev ~20) compared to the prior stable high period (Avg ~83). Recent sequence (54, 94, 57, 51) highlights oscillation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (late April). The demand regime shift starting in Period 7 is now well-established over 5 periods (P7-P11). This 'Regime B' is characterized by a lower mean (~64 units) compared to the prior peak (P2-P6 avg ~83), but with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~17 vs ~4). Period 11's demand of 63 perfectly matches the mean of this volatile block, confirming the structural shift. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to cleanly capture this new 5-period block, excluding the obsolete high-demand data from P2-P6. This ensures the forecast reflects the lower average while the high sigma buffers against spikes like Period 8 (94). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatile regime (P7-P11) solidified: Mean stabilized at ~64 with persistent high volatility (StdDev ~17). N=5 is the optimal lookback window to capture this block without pollution from the prior high-demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6). Current context: Lead time remains reliably 0 (instant arrival). Demand pattern has stabilized into a lower-mean, moderate-volatility regime compared to the early-season high. Looking at the last 6 periods (P7-P12: 54, 94, 57, 51, 63, 68), the average is ~64.5 units with a standard deviation of ~15.9. This is distinct from the peak period (P2-P6 avg ~83) and shows signs of settling after the extreme oscillations of P7-P9. The most recent three periods (P10-P12: 51, 63, 68) show tighter clustering around 60. Given the high service level target (critical ratio 0.8) but high holding cost (25% of margin), we should avoid overreacting to the single outlier (94 in P8). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full extent of this current lower-demand block (starting at the P7 drop) while acknowledging the volatility. This balances protection against stockouts with inventory efficiency.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P7-P12) confirmed as lower mean (~64.5) with moderate volatility (std ~16), distinct from early season peak (~83).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (Mid-May). Demand regime identified starting Period 7 continues to hold validity (P7-P13 mean ~65). While Periods 12-13 show a local stabilization at 68 units, the broader window (N=7) includes significant volatility (std dev ~14.5, range 51-94) which must be accounted for in safety stock. The high-demand early spring peak (Avg ~83) is definitively over. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We select N=7 for both mean and volatility to capture the full profile of this current regime (lower mean, higher variance) rather than over-reacting to the very recent stability or the older high-demand block.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P7-P13) sustains a lower mean (~65) with high volatility (std ~14.5) compared to early season. Although P12-P13 stabilized at 68, the regime remains risk-prone due to earlier fluctuations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) marks a clear stabilization in demand. After the volatile transition regime (P7-P10), the last 4 periods (P11-P14) have settled into a tight range [63-68], averaging ~66 units. I am switching Mu_hat to a short window (N=4) to accurately track this new stable mean and avoid under-forecasting due to the P9/P10 dips. However, given the high volatility observed just 5-8 periods ago (e.g., P8=94), I am retaining a wider window (N=8) for Sigma_hat. This provides a safety buffer (StdDev ~13.7) against sudden spikes, ensuring a target base stock around 77-78 units to cover the 80% critical ratio service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 11-14 show a distinct steady regime (Avg ~66, StdDev ~2.0) following the volatile P7-P10 block. Volatility risk has decreased significantly, though P8 outlier suggests maintaining some safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (Late May) follows a 5-period block of highly stable demand (P11-P15: Avg 66.4, StdDev ~2.1). This indicates a strong regime shift away from the volatility observed in P7-P10. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must balance precision with safety. I select 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat to accurately target the current demand level of ~66 units. However, relying on the extremely low recent volatility (N=5) for safety stock would leave us vulnerable to spikes like those seen in P8 (94 units). Therefore, I use 'recent_N' (N=10) for sigma_hat, which incorporates the volatile period (P6-P10), adding a safety buffer (StdDev ~12 observed over N=10 vs ~2 over N=5). Lead time remains consistently observed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 11-15 established a steady regime (mean ~66.4, low variance) replacing previous volatility. While the forecasted mean should track this stability (N=5), safety stock parameters should retain memory of prior volatility (N=10+) to hedge against potential spikes given the high service level requirement.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand dropped sharply to 46 units, a 30% decrease from the stable P11-P15 average (~66.4), likely due to seasonal warming (June 3rd, summer start) reducing demand for 'jersey leggings'. This breaks the recent stable regime. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg ~63) to quickly incorporate this downward signal while smoothing slightly. For sigma_hat, I expand to recent_N=10 to capture the increased variance (including the new low of 46 and older highs like 94), ensuring the safety stock buffer remains robust against a potential demand rebound, given the high profit margin (critical ratio 0.80). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Stable demand regime (P11-P15) broken by sharp drop in Period 16 (46 units). Indicates potential seasonal decline (summer) or return to volatility; variance has increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand (67 units) rebounded precisely to the stable average observed in Periods 12-15 (~67 units), suggesting the sharp drop in Period 16 (46 units) was a transient outlier (likely related to the Memorial Day holiday on May 27th) rather than a sustained seasonal downturn. Because the underlying demand remains strong despite the one-off drop, I select N=6 for estimation. This window (P12-P17) captures the prevailing stability (~67 units) while allowing the high variance from P16 to naturally inflate the safety stock, protecting against future fluctuations without overreacting to the single low data point. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 17 rebound to 67 units confirms Period 16 (46 units) was a transient outlier (likely holiday) rather than a downward trend. Fundamental demand remains stable around ~67 units (P12-P15 avg), though P16 increases volatility metrics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 0. Demand is showing signs of a summer slowdown, with the most recent 3-period average (57) distinctly lower than the spring stable block (~66-67). We switch mu_hat to recent_N=3 to rapidly adapt to this lower consumption rate. Sigma_hat needs to cover the recent volatility (swing from 46 to 67), so we set N=6 to include the recent unstable period alongside the prior stability for a balanced safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand softening confirmed: Recent 3-period average (P16-P18) is ~57 units, distinctly lower than the P12-P15 stable mean of ~67. This downward shift aligns with summer seasonality for leggings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June). Demand has distinctly softened over the last 4 weeks (P16: 46, P17: 67, P18: 58, P19: 47), averaging ~54.5, compared to the stable ~67 of P12-P15. This downward trend aligns with summer seasonality where heavy leggings become less desirable. The most recent observation (47) reinforces the lower regime. Actual lead time remains reliably 0. On-hand is 18, so we need to replenish to the new seasonally-adjusted level. We will use a short N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent drop (avg ~54.5) while keeping a wider N for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in P16-P19.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand slump confirms: P16-P19 average ~54.5 is 18% lower than P12-P15 stable mean (~67). Volatility has increased (std ~9.6 in P16-P19 vs ~2.0 in P11-P15).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st) marks the deepening of the summer season. Demand in Period 20 hit a historical low of 30 units, confirming the downward trend identified in Periods 16-19. The 5-period average has dropped to ~50 units, significantly below the spring stable average of ~66. To prevent overstocking as demand falls, `mu_hat` uses a responsive N=3 (avg ~45). `sigma_hat` uses N=5 to capture the high volatility (std dev ~14) caused by this rapid downward shift. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer seasonal slump confirmed: Period 20 demand (30 units) is the lowest on record, pulling the recent 5-period average down to ~50 units (vs ~67 in late spring).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) confirms the 'Summer Slump' for long leggings is fully established. Demand in the last 3 periods (P19-P21) averaged ~39 units, a sharp contrast to the Spring average of ~80+. The slight recovery in Period 21 (39 units) from Period 20's low (30 units) suggests a volatile but low baseline. To minimize holding costs while maintaining service, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to tightly track this lower summer baseline. I am keeping sigma_hat at 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the recent downward transition (StdDev ~14.6) as a safety buffer against unexpected demand spikes. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime stabilized: Recent 3-period average (P19-P21) is ~39 units, confirming a sustained ~50% drop from spring peaks due to seasonality.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (mid-July, Summer). The summer seasonal slump persists, with recent demand (P18-P22) averaging ~45 units, distinct from the spring average of ~67. While Period 20 bottomed out at 30 units, Period 22 recovered to 50, suggesting the true mean for this low season is likely around 45 rather than the floor of 30. We use a short N=5 horizon for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-volume, moderately volatile summer regime (std dev ~11) without dragging in high spring data. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline adjustment: Period 22 recovery (50 units) after the P20 low (30) suggests the summer regime mean is approx 45 units (P18-P22 avg), rather than spiraling downward. Volatility persists.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22. The 'Summer Slump' regime persists and has deepened. Period 23 demand (33 units) confirms that the rebound in Period 22 (50 units) was volatility rather than a recovery trend. The recent 4-period average (P20-P23) has settled at ~38 units, significantly lower than the P12-P15 stable mean of ~67. Volatility remains moderate (std dev ~9 over last 5 periods). We set mu_hat using N=4 to tightly track this lower summer baseline (P20-P23), while keeping sigma_hat at N=5 to maintain a robust safety buffer against the observed oscillations (30 vs 50). Lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime correction: Period 23 (33 units) pulls the summer regime average down to ~38 units (P20-P23 avg), correcting the previous estimate of 45. The regime is characterized by a low mean (~38) and moderate volatility (~9), confirming deep seasonality.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29) confirms the deep summer low-demand regime for leggings. The last 5 periods (P20-P24) show an average demand of ~37.8 units with a standard deviation of ~6.9, significantly lower than the spring peak (~80s). The most recent demand (P24: 37 units) aligns perfectly with this average. Given the high holding cost ratio ($1 vs $4 profit), it is critical not to overstock based on outdated high averages. I will use 'recent_N=5' for both mu and sigma to reflect this specific summer seasonality. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-demand regime fully stabilized: P20-P24 average is ~38 units (std ~7), confirming a persistent seasonal bottom for July. Expect this to continue until late August.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August (2019/8/5). The deep summer seasonal slump has persisted and stabilized, with demand in the last 3 periods (P23-P25) averaging just ~34 units, significantly lower than the Spring peak. The 6-period average (P20-P25) is approx 37 units. Given the high service cost (critical ratio 0.8), I will use a short N=5 lookback for both mean and volatility to stay responsive to this low-volume regime while capturing the minor fluctuations (e.g., the spike to 50 in P22). Lead times remain reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough persists into August: P23-P25 average dropped to ~34 units, confirming sustained low demand season.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Aug 12 (Period 27). Product (Leggings) is entering the 'Back to School'/Autumn transition, where demand typically recovers from summer lows. Period 26 demand (44 units) shows a noticeable lift (+29%) compared to the recent summer trough (P23-P25 avg ~34 units), confirming calendar expectations. With critically low on-hand inventory (1 unit) and high service level requirements (Ratio ~0.8), we must anticipate rising demand. Using N=5 for estimation is strategic: it includes the Period 22 spike (50 units) alongside the recent recovery (44 units), yielding a higher mean (~39.4) than shorter windows (N=3 avg ~38 or N=4 avg ~36.8). This ensures we build stock ahead of the seasonal curve. Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery signal: Period 26 demand (44 units) breaks the sustained summer trough (P23-P25 avg ~34), aligning with mid-August retail calendar for leggings.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (Aug 19) marks a definitive exit from the summer slump, driven by 'Back-to-School' seasonality. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 68 units (double the mid-summer average of ~34), causing a stockout. Historical data from Spring suggests 'normal' demand for this SKU sits between 65-85 units. Relying on recent averages (polluted by July lows) would cause severe under-stocking. I am switching to 'explicit' forecasting to aggressively target this restored demand level (setting mu=75, slightly above the latest observation to account for upward momentum) and widening sigma to 25 to handle the volatility of the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery confirmed: Market exited summer trough with sharp demand increase in Period 27 (68 units vs P23-P25 avg of ~34). Demand has returned to pre-summer levels (matching May avg ~67), signaling the start of Autumn/Back-to-School season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 corresponds to late August, where the transition from summer trough to autumn demand is evident. While Period 28 demand (49) dipped from the Period 27 spike (68), the recent 3-period average (~54 units) is significantly higher than the July summer trough (~35 units). The market has exited the low-demand season. I am using a short lookback window (N=3) for both mean and volatility to capture this regime shift without dragging down the forecast with obsolete July data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery sustained: Recent 3-period average (P26-P28) is ~54 units, marking a ~50% increase over the July trough. High volatility (range 44-68) characterizes this transition.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 corresponds to early September (Back-to-School), confirming the new season. While Period 27 spiked to 68, Periods 28-29 moderated to ~47.5, suggesting the P27 spike was an initial seasonal loading or outlier. The 3-period average (~54 units) effectively bridges the gap between the stabilization at ~48 and the potential for spikes back to 68. Using N=3 for estimation is optimal to capture this volatile transition out of the summer trough while discarding the irrelevant low-demand data from July. We rely on the inflated variance from N=3 to generate adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Following the initial recovery spike (P27: 68), demand has moderated to a steady ~48 units (P28-P29 avg). This confirms the exit from the summer trough (~35 avg) but establishes a 'soft autumn' baseline currently below the spring peak levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 experienced a massive demand spike to 95 units (highest on record), resulting in a stockout (lost sales). This shatters the 'soft autumn' pattern seen in P28-29 (~48 units) and confirms a shift to a high-volatility, high-demand Autumn regime comparable to the early-year peak season. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must react aggressively to this volatility. We select a short N=4 lookback window for both mean and standard deviation. This window captures the recovery starting in P27 (68) and the extreme variance of P30 (95) versus the intervening dips, producing a high volatility estimate (sigma) that will drive safety stock up to protect against further 90+ spikes.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volatility regime confirmed: Period 30 demand (95 units) is a new historical max, causing a stockout. This proves the 'soft start' of P28-29 was temporary noise. N=4 is now the optimal window to capture this extreme variance (StdDev ~22.5).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-September (Period 32), deep in the 'Back-to-School' / Autumn season for leggings. The new high-demand regime is fully confirmed by Period 31's record demand of 101 units and Period 30's 95 units, both resulting in stockouts. The recent 2-period average is 98 units, drastically higher than the August/Summer baseline (~40-50). To arrest stockouts and capture this established upward trend, we set mu_hat using N=2 (excluding the lower Period 29). For sigma_hat, we use N=4 to capture the extreme volatility (StdDev ~29) inherent in this rapid seasonal transition, ensuring a safety stock buffer capable of covering demands exceeding 120 units. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime solidified: Periods 30-31 (avg 98) confirm a ~100% increase over summer levels, establishing a new peak season baseline. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~29 over P28-P31) due to the rapid upward shift.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 23 (Period 33). The Back-to-School surge (Periods 30-31, avg 98 units) appears to have cooled in Period 32 (65 units), likely stabilizing into a standard Autumn demand pattern. However, the recent drop from 101 to 65 highlights extreme volatility (StdDev ~19 over N=3). Given the high service level incentive (profit $4 vs holding $1), the risk of understocking during a cold-weather seasonal transition outweighs the cost of holding inventory. We select N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture the high recent ceiling (101) while acknowledging the moderation (65), ensuring buffer stock covers potential recurring spikes typical of September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand modulation: Period 32 (65 units) marks a drop from the Back-to-School peak (P30-P31 avg ~98), suggesting the initial seasonal rush is tapering. However, the regime remains highly volatile (StdDev ~19 over last 3 periods), necessitating short lookback windows to prevent stockouts.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (End of September) signals peak autumn demand for leggings. Demand reached a historical high of 114 units in Period 33, causing a stockout. The autumn regime (Period 30-33) is characterized by a high average (~94 units) and significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~21, oscillating between 65 and 114). The previous strategy under-estimated demand variance, leading to repeated stockouts. To mitigate this and capture the high-intensity seasonal peak, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mu and sigma. This window strictly isolates the high-demand autumn block (P30-P33) without diluting the forecast with pre-season data from August.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Peak season intensity confirmed: demand hit record 114 in Period 33. The active regime (P30-P33) sustains a high mean (~94) with extreme volatility (range 65-114), causing repeated stockouts.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7) confirms the 'Autumn High' regime is active and volatile. While Period 34 demand (82) moderated from the Period 33 peak (114), the 5-period average (Period 30-34) remains high at ~91 units with significant variance (standard deviation ~19). We maintain N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this full high-demand block (P30-P34) without letting older summer trough data dilute the forecast. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volatility regime continues: P30-P34 average is ~91 units with large swings (65 to 114), confirming the need for sustained high safety stock parameters.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (mid-October). The 'Back to School' peak appears to be softening, with recent demand (P34: 82, P35: 73) trending below the September highs (peaks of 101, 114). However, the overall autumn regime remains active and volatile compared to summer levels. Using N=5 for estimation captures this recent mix of extreme peaks and moderate cooling (Avg ~87, StdDev ~18), balancing responsiveness with stability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak moderation: Demand shows signs of cooling from September highs, with P34-P35 averaging ~77.5 units compared to the ~98 unit average of P30-P31. Volatility remains high, but the extreme upward pressure appears to be relaxing as the season matures.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Oct 21. We observe a distinct cooling trend in the Autumn demand peak. Period 36 demand dropped to 51, the lowest since August. The 3-period trend (82->73->51) suggests the 'Back-to-School' rush has subsided, settling into a lower pre-holiday baseline. However, extreme volatility persists (Period 33 was 114 units), so relying on too short a history is dangerous for safety stock estimation. We select N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full range of this erratic high-variance regime (spanning 51 to 114) while allowing the mean to drift downward moderately (Avg ~77). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling confirmed: P34-P36 average (~69) is significantly lower than early Sept peak (P30-P33 avg ~94), though volatility remains extremely high (std~24 based on N=5).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late October (2019/10/28). The post-Back-to-School cooling trend observed in recent weeks has stabilized. The average demand over Periods 34-37 is approximately 68.5 units, which matches the historical demand levels seen in Jan-Feb 2019 (~70 units), suggesting a return to a 'cold weather' baseline after the September spike. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to strictly align the forecast with this lower settled mean (removing the influence of the P33 spike of 114). However, to mitigate stockout risks given the recent history of extreme variance, I am using recent_N=8 for sigma_hat, which keeps the high volatility of September in the safety stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand normalization confirmed: Periods 34-37 average (~69 units) establishes a stable post-peak baseline, aligning with start-of-year historical levels (~70 units). This indicates the end of the September peak regime (avg ~94). Volatility remains a risk factor, requiring extended lookback for variance estimation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4, 2019 (Period 39). The intense 'Back-to-School' peak of September (avg ~95) has concluded, with October demand normalizing to a lower baseline. The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) average ~66 units, showing a distinct cooling trend from the peak, though the product (Leggings) remains relevant for the season. Period 38 demand (57 units) confirms this lower stabilized level. Volatility has also compressed significantly compared to September (StdDev ~12 vs ~25). We select N=5 for both mean and variance to capture this new stable post-peak regime while maintaining a slight buffer against pre-holiday demand ticks typical of November. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Period 38 (57 units) reinforces the cooling trend established in October. The recent 5-period average is ~66 units, significantly down from the September peak (~95). Volatility has compressed, signaling a stable pre-holiday baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 11 (Period 40). Demand has firmly stabilized after the Autumn peak (Sept/Oct), with the most recent 4 periods (P36-P39) averaging ~58 units and showing low volatility. This represents a distinct inter-seasonal trough or 'cooling' period. However, given the date is mid-November, we are approaching the Winter/Holiday retail season. Relying solely on the low trough data (N=4) risks understocking if demand begins to ramp up for holidays. Therefore, I am selecting N=6 (including P34=82 and P35=73) to maintain a slightly higher forecast (~64.6 units) and variance buffer (safety stock), balancing current low demand against the high cost of stocking out (Profit/Cost ratio implies 80% service level). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Inter-seasonal baseline deepening: Periods 36-39 average ~58 units, stabilizing lower than the previously estimated post-peak measures (~66-69). This confirms a calm trough before the expected Winter holiday ramp-up.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 demand (76 units) marked a sharp exit from the recent inter-seasonal trough (avg ~58), resulting in a stockout. With the date (Nov 18) approaching Black Friday, this increase signals the start of the holiday demand ramp. To capture the full scope of seasonal volatility and avoid underestimating the rising mean, we switch to a wider lookback window (N=8). This window incorporates the high-demand Autumn peaks (P33-35) and the recent variance, producing a robust average (~72) and high standard deviation estimate (~20) to generate sufficient safety stock (~89 units) for the expected holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season ramp-up confirmed: Period 40 demand (76 units) broke the inter-seasonal lull (~58 units), signaling renewed volatility and upward momentum ahead of Black Friday.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 25 (Period 42), marking the start of Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, traditionally a high-demand period. While Period 41 demand (55) dipped from the Period 40 spike (76), this oscillation (55-76) characterizes the volatile pre-holiday regime. I am selecting a short lookback window (N=4) for both mean and volatility to capture this recent chopped pattern and ensure the safety stock reacts to the variance (std dev ~10) ahead of the expected promotional volume.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility confirmed: P40 spike (76) followed by P41 dip (55) indicates choppy demand entering Black Friday week (Nov 25), replacing the stable inter-seasonal baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (Dec 2) marks the start of the core holiday shopping season immediately following the Black Friday spike observed in Period 42 (129 units). This demand surge caused a stockout and signaled a definitive regime shift from the inter-seasonal lull to high-intensity holiday demand. To respond to this abrupt increase and the associated volatility (Periods 40-42 show huge swings: 76 -> 55 -> 129), I am switching to a highly responsive N=3 lookback for both mean and volatility. This captures the new 'Holiday' baseline (~87 units) and the extreme variance (std dev ~38), ensuring safety stock is sufficient to cover potential sustained high demand in December.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Peak confirmed: Period 42 demand exploded to 129 units (Black Friday), a >100% increase over the Oct baseline. This marks the onset of the high-volatility winter holiday regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 9 (Period 44). We observed a sharp correction in Period 43 (43 units) following the massive Black Friday spike in Period 42 (129 units). This volatility is characteristic of the holiday season, where weekly demand swings wildly. With Christmas (Dec 25) approaching, demand is expected to rebound from the P43 lull. I am setting N=5 for both mean and volatility to smooth the P42 spike into the baseline (Avg ~72) while maintaining a high standard deviation (driven by the 43-129 spread) to generate sufficient safety stock for the final holiday push.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday volatility confirmed: Period 43 demand plummeted to 43 units (-67% from P42), demonstrating that the holiday regime is defined by extreme variance. Looking back 5 periods captures this mix of lulls and spikes optimally.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final shipping window for Christmas orders. Demand in Period 44 (54 units) stabilized near the Period 41 level/Period 43 hangover (avg ~48), confirming a baseline around ~55 units between major spikes. However, the proximity to Christmas combined with the 'Leggings/Tights | Mama' product type suggests a potential final seasonal surge. The volatility in limit-history (Periods 40-44: 76, 55, 129, 43, 54) is extreme (StdDev ~34). Using N=5 for estimation produces a mean of ~71 but importantly captures the huge variance from Black Friday, driving a high safety stock calculation. This buffers against a likely pre-Christmas spike similar to the P40 ramp-up or P42 peak, while reacting to the recent stabilizing data.

Carry-over insight: Holiday baseline established: Periods 43-44 (avg ~48.5 units) suggest the non-promotion holiday baseline is ~50 units, significantly lower than the Black Friday peak (129). However, volatility remains the defining characteristic of this regime (StdDev ~34 over last 5 periods), requiring parameters that heavily weight variance protection.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23 (Period 46). Demand has stabilized at a low level (avg ~48 units) for the last three periods (P43-P45) following the Black Friday spike. However, January historical data indicates a return to high demand (fitness seasonality) and volatility. To bridge the current lull with the upcoming expected seasonal rise, we use N=5 for mu_hat (~66 units) which deliberately over-forecasts the current low mean to build a buffer. We also maintain N=5 for sigma_hat to keep the high variance of Period 42 (129 units) in the safety stock calculation, protecting against holiday/January surges.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday lull confirmed: Periods 43-45 averaged ~48 units, consistently significantly lower than the P42 peak (129). This establishes a distinct low-demand regime for mid-December, though historical pre-game data suggests a rebound in January.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to Dec 30, the end of the post-holiday lull. Observed demand in Periods 43-46 has been consistently low (avg ~46.5) and stable. However, historical pre-game data for January (Jan 7 observed 73 units, Jan 28 observed 94 units) indicates a high likelihood of a sharp demand rebound in the coming weeks ('New Year' fitness seasonality). rely on N=4 would set base stock too low (~55 units) and risk stockouts if January seasonality kicks in immediately. Therefore, I am selecting N=5 for estimation. This window includes the Black Friday spike (P42), elevating expected mean (~63) and variance (~33) to build a defensive buffer (~117 units) suitable for the anticipated January demand surge while actual lead times remain 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-December lull solidified: Periods 43-46 established a stable low-demand regime (avg ~46.5 units) with low volatility, distinct from the holiday peak. This sets a low baseline immediately preceding the expected January seasonal shift.
