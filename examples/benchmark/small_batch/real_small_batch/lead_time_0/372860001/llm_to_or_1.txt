Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Current date is Feb 11, 2019. The product is basic trainer socks. Historical demand history (5 weeks) shows an average of approximately 266 units with a slight peak in late Jan. Demand seems stable around 270 recently. Inventory is empty (0 units), requiring an immediate stocking order. Promised lead time is 0 periods, which I will treat as the default until observed otherwise. Using the full available 5-week history (recent_N=5) to establish the initial demand mean and volatility estimates for the base stock calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision. Current Date: 2019/02/18. On-hand inventory is critically low (2 units) following efficient sales in Period 1 (Demand 287). Lead time performed as promised in Period 1 (0 periods), confirming same-period replenishment capability. Demand history (5 historical + 1 observed) is consistent, averaging ~270 units with moderate volatility. Using the full available history (N=6) for demand parameters to capture robust mean and variance estimates. Default lead time is retained as P1 observation matched the promise perfectly.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 372860001 experienced a massive demand spike in Period 2 (548 units), nearly doubling the previous average of ~270. This caused a stockout and lost sales. Given the high profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, favoring high service levels. To respond to this abrupt shift without assuming it's permanent based on a single data point, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3. This incorporates the high P2 value into the mean and significantly increases the variance estimate (sigma_hat), resulting in a higher safety stock to buffer against potential continued high demand while anchoring slightly to the prior stable weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1495.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 4. Following a massive demand spike in Period 2 (548 units) and sustained high demand in Period 3 (399 units), the short-term average (last 3 periods: ~411) is significantly higher than the pre-game baseline (~270). Lead time remains reliably 0 (observed in P1-P3). I am determining parameters using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent increase in mean and variance, ensuring the inventory buffer is sufficient to prevent repeat stockouts (like in Period 2) given the high cost of lost sales relative to holding cost. The volatile nature of recent demand (Range: 287-548) justifies a higher safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11 (Period 5). Product is 'Trainer socks', which typically sees higher demand in spring/summer compared to winter. Observed demand shift starting in Period 2 (Feb 18) confirms this seasonal transition, although Period 2 (548) was significantly higher than Periods 3 (399) and 4 (338), suggesting a spike followed by stabilization at a higher new baseline (mid-300s) compared to January history (~270). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (promised matches actual). Given the Critical Ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), stockouts are costly. Therefore, I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the new higher demand regime and the associated volatility from the seasonal shift, ensuring sufficient safety stock without overreacting solely to the P2 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand regime shift confirmed Feb-Mar (P2-P4): Mean demand increased to ~428 units (vs ~266 in Jan) with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $771.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (March 18). Demand in P5 (252) dropped significantly from the Feb/Mar spike (P2-P4 avg ~428), returning to levels consistent with January history (~266). This suggests the seasonal surge may be ending or was a short-term event. However, given the extreme volatility (range 252-548 observed recently) and the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding), we maintain a conservative stance. We use 'recent_N=5' for both demand and volatility to average the high spike with the recent drop (mean ~365, high sigma), ensuring sufficient safety stock against another fluctuation while recognizing the downward trend. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 25. Analyzing recent demand history (Feb-Mar), we saw a significant spike in mid-February (548) but demand has since stabilized downward (399 -> 338 -> 252 -> 329). The average over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is ~373, but with high variance. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~428 in the peak, but recent periods suggest a cooling off or normalization closer to ~300-330. Given the high cost of stockouts (q=0.8) and the high volatility observed in P2-P4, I will maintain a responsive forecast using the last 5 periods to capture the recent volatility without overreacting to the single low point in P5. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1608.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st): Product is 'trainer socks', a spring/summer item. Demand rebounded strongly in P7 (415 units) after a dip in P5 (252 units), confirming continued high volatility and seasonal relevance. Lead time remains consistently 0 (immediate). Given the high cost of stockouts (0.8 critical fractile) and erratic demand, I am using a 5-period rolling window (P3-P7) for forecasting. This excludes the extreme P2 outlier (548) while capturing the current volatile 'Spring' regime (range 252-415, mean ~347). This balances responsiveness with stability.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand volatility persisting (P3-P7): Mean settling ~347 units (down from Feb peak 428), but range remains wide (252-415).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8) precedes Easter (April 21 in 2019), likely sustaining the higher 'Basic Shaftless' sock demand observed in recent weeks. Demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) averaged ~343 units, but with significant volatility (range 252-415). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. With low on-hand inventory (20 units) and a high service level target (critical ratio 0.8), we prioritize availability. I select 'recent_N=5' for both demand and volatility to capture the full spring oscillation (including the P5 dip and P7/P8 highs), ensuring the safety stock calculation accounts for this variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1214.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April): Demand remains volatile within the Spring regime established over the last 5 periods (P5-P9 range: 252-415, mean ~340). Actual lead time remains reliably 0 (consistent immediate delivery). To address the continued demand fluctuation while balancing the 4:1 Profit/Holding ratio, I am using a recent_N=5 estimator. This window captures the full recent volatility (including the low of 252 and high of 415), resulting in a higher standard deviation estimate to buffer safety stock, despite a slightly lower mean compared to a shorter window. No missing shipments detected.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (Late April, post-Easter). History consistently confirms Lead Time = 0 (same-day arrival). Demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) has stabilized around an average of ~351 units, settling from the extreme volatility seen in February/early March. While there is a slight downward trend in the last 3 periods (382->322->308), the critical fractile (0.8) favors maintaining high service levels over aggressive inventory reduction. I am selecting recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture this 'settled spring' regime (mean ~351, std ~44) while smoothing out the single high outlier in P7.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Late April (2019/4/29). Demand analysis: The most recent observation (Period 11, late April) saw a sharp spike to 427 units, causing a stockout. This contradicts the slight softening seen in early April (308-322). The erratic spring pattern persists, with demand ranging widely from ~250 to ~550 since Feb. The last 4 periods (P8-P11) have averaged ~360 units, but with high variance (382, 322, 308, 427). The most recent spike suggests we cannot be too conservative. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the Critical Ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Cost 1), stockouts are costly ($4 lost margin). I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods to capture this recent oscillation (avg ~360) and keep sigma_hat sensitive (recent_4 std ~53) to buffer against spikes like P11.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: April volatility high; sharp spike to 427 units in P11 after lull suggests erratic spring demand continues.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date (May 6) aligns with peak seasonality for trainer socks. Demand has surged in the last two periods (P11: 427, P12: 438), causing consecutive stockouts. This indicates a regime shift from the early April average (~337 units) to a new Summer level (~433+ units). I am effectively ignoring older data for the mean to catch this trend immediately, setting mu_hat explicitly to 435 (approx avg of last 2 periods). I retain a 5-period window for sigma to capture the high volatility (std dev ~60) inherent in this transition, ensuring a robust safety stock buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: May demand surge confirmed; P11-P12 averaged ~433 units (vs ~337 in early April), establishing a new high-volume regime for summer trainer socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 corresponds to mid-May. Demand history shows extreme volatility: P11-P12 were high (~430 units) causing stockouts, but P13 dropped unexpectedly to 267 despite ample inventory (end on-hand 218). This fluctuation (range 267-438 in 3 weeks) signals a highly unstable spring/summer regime. Given the 80% critical fractile (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), we prioritize service level to capture potential peaks like P12. We select recent_N (N=3) for both mu and sigma to model this immediate volatility (Mean ~377, StdDev ~96), targeting a base stock around 457 units to cover demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring/Summer volatility confirmed: Demand oscillates wildly (267-438 range in P11-P13), requiring responsive parameters (N=3) and high safety stock to cover 400+ unit peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $917.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20). Trainer socks enter peak season. Recent demand is extremely volatile: aggressive spikes in P11-12 (>420) followed by a sharp drop in P13-14 (~270). Given the high profit-to-holding ratio (4:1), stocking out during a summer spike is costly. Using N=4 for mu and sigma incorporates the recent high spikes into the demand distribution, raising the safety stock (via high std dev) to protect against another surge while acknowledging the lower recent average. Current on-hand (183) is insufficient to cover potential 400+ unit spikes seen just 3 weeks ago.

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility confirmed: Demand oscillates between peak (~430) and baseline (~270) within 2-week windows. Service level maintenance requires buffering for the upper bound of this swing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1309.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27. Demand rebounded to 348 in P15 after a short lull. History (P11-P15) shows oscillations between ~270 and ~438. To prevent stockouts during the 'high' phase of this oscillation (summer seasonality), we adhere to recent_5 for mu_hat (avg ~351) and sigma_hat to capture the P11/P12 spikes in volatility. N=3 would risk understocking by ignoring the 400+ peaks just 4 weeks ago. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Summer demand oscillation pattern persists; demand rebounded to 348 in P15 after two low weeks (~270). High variance requires covering peaks >400 units seen in P11-12 to maintain service level.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (June 3) confirms a solid demand rebound for seasonal trainer socks, with the last two periods averaging ~359 units (348, 370) following the early May dip. The 6-period window (P11-P16) reveals high volatility (std dev ~74) with peaks reaching 438, suggesting the early May lull (267-275) was temporary. Given the CR of 0.8 and the risk of recurring summer spikes >400 units, I am widening the observation window to N=6 to capture the full volatility profile (including the high-demand events in late April). This approach yields a higher mean (~354) and sigma to bolster safety stock against June seasonality.

Carry-over insight: June recovery confirmed: Demand rebounding (370 units in P16) after early May dip; high volatility regime persists (P11-P16 range 267-438) requiring N=6 to capture upside risk.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) context: Item is summer seasonal (trainer socks). Demand in P17 (297 units) dipped following the P16 recovery, continuing a high-volatility oscillation pattern established since late April. The last 7 periods (P11-P17) exhibit a wide range (267-438) with a mean of ~346. To maintain service levels against potential summer spikes >400 units (seen in P11-P12), I am selecting N=7. This window captures the full 'Summer Start' regime, ensuring the peaks are included in the mean and variance calculations to buffer inventory appropriately given the high cost of lost sales vs holding. Observed lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1065.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (mid-June). Demand for trainer socks continues to exhibit high volatility with a 'saw-tooth' pattern (oscillating between ~295 and ~370+). While the last two periods (P17-P18) settled around ~295, prior weeks (P15-P16) were much higher (348, 370), and late April saw peaks of ~430. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the cost of underestimating a rebound is four times the cost of overstocking. Therefore, I am maintaining a longer observation window (N=8, covering the entire volatile spring/summer regime starting P11) for both mean and standard deviation. This incorporates the high-demand spikes into the base stock calculation, providing a safety buffer in case the oscillation swings upward again in late June. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: June saw-tooth pattern identified: Demand alternates between high volatility peaks (~370) and lower baselines (~295) in 2-week sub-cycles (High: P15-16, Low: P17-18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24) marks full summer season. The last 9 periods (P11-P19) have shown significant volatility (range 267-438) with a mean of ~338. However, recently we observed a 'saw-tooth' pattern where demand fluctuates every 2 weeks. After two lower/stable weeks (P17: 297, P18: 294), demand ticked up in P19 (334). Given the summer seasonality for trainer socks and the demonstrated capacity for sharp spikes (>400 in P11, P12), we must protect against stockouts. We use recent_N=9 (covering the post-Easter volatile period starting P11) to capture the full range of summer behavior including spread. The mean of the last 9 periods is roughly 338, but the standard deviation is high. We stick to promised lead time (0) as all deliveries have been reliable.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility confirmed: P11-P19 avg ~338 with peaks >430; localized trend shows potential uptick (P19=334 vs P17-18 ~295) consistent with varying summer heat.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st). Observation indicates a distinct June stabilization regime (P17-P20) where demand averaged ~304 units with a tighter range (289-334), contrasting with the erratic 400+ unit spikes seen in April/May. However, the 'saw-tooth' volatility persists on a smaller scale, and P15-P16 (348, 370) remind us that summer peaks can exceed the current average. To prevent over-correction to the recent lows while maintaining service for potential 350+ demand, I select recent_N=6. This window incorporates the June stability and the late-May variability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: June stabilization confirmed (P17-P20): Mean demand settled to ~304 units with reduced volatility (range 289-334), a distinct cooling from the April/May regime (avg ~366, peaks >430).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) marks the continuation of summer. The demand profile has stabilized significantly over the last 5-6 weeks compared to the erratic spring period. The average demand from P17-P21 is approximately 306 units, with a tighter range (289-334) than the 260-440 swings seen in April/May. However, trainer socks are a seasonal summer item, and July could bring sudden heat-driven spikes similar to P16 (370 units). Therefore, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mean and volatility. N=6 includes the spike in P16 (370), preventing the forecast from becoming too complacent while still focusing on the recent stabilized regime (avg ~317). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer stability persisting (P17-P21): Demand averaging ~306 with narrower range (289-334) compared to erratic spring peaks; volatility remains subdued.

=== Period 23 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1288.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 experienced a demand spike to 352 units (the highest since late May), breaking the recent stable range (289-334) and resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests the low-volatility mid-summer period may be transitioning into a late-summer peak or increased variance phase. To address the stockout and the rising local trend (P21-P23 avg ~327), I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3. For sigma_hat, I use a wider window (N=10) to encompass the broader summer volatility profile (including May peaks), ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects potential upside risk rather than just the recent quiet period. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Late July instability: P23 demand (352 units) broke the 6-week stable range (289-334), indicating a potential end to the mid-summer lull.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (late July) context: Demand in P24 dropped to 277, following a spike to 352 in P23. This confirms the breakdown of the stable June/early-July regime (previously 289-334) into a more volatile phase with a wider range (277-352). While the mean remains consistent (~315 over the last 4 weeks), the standard deviation has increased. To address this widening variance and avoid stockouts during potential rebounds (or overstocking during drops), we switch to highly responsive parameters (N=4 for both mean and volatility). This shorter window captures the recent oscillation better than the longer stable baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late July volatility confirmed: Demand range widened significantly in P23-P24 (277-352) compared to the stable June baseline (289-334), checking the previous stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $939.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August. While demand has dropped significantly in the last two weeks (352 -> 277 -> 256), reaching a season low in P25, we must be cautious not to over-correct based on a single low data point given the historic volatility (saw-tooth pattern) of this SKU. The product (trainer socks) is still relevant in August. Using N=5 captures the recent dip (P25=256) but balances it with the mid-July spike (P23=352), resulting in a forecast of ~303 units. This maintains a buffer against a potential rebound before the season truly ends. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand cooling: Sequential decline confirmed (P23: 352 -> P24: 277 -> P25: 256), with P25 marking the lowest demand since March. Avg of last 3 periods (~295) dipping below the 300-level summer baseline.

Demand has cooled significantly in late summer (P24-P26 avg ~264 units vs P23 peak 352). Adopting specific responsive parameters to align inventory with this lower regime while maintaining safety stock based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand has settled into a lower regime (P24-P26 avg ~264) following the mid-July peak, further declining from the stable June baseline (~305).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (Aug 19) follows a stockout in Period 27 where demand (301) exceeded inventory (296), breaking the recent cooling trend (avg ~263 in P24-26). Although the general late-summer trend is downward, the sudden jump indicates volatility is not fully gone. We are in a 'Late Summer' regime where demand is generally lower than the May/June peak but susceptible to back-to-school or seasonal transition spikes. To addressing the stockout (P27 ended with 0 units) and preventing another service failure while respecting the generally lower underlying mean, I will use a robust recent_N=5 estimator. This captures the P27 spike (301) and the P23 high (352) alongside the cooler weeks, averaging ~289. This is safer than the purely cooling short-term average. Lead time remains effectively 0 as all orders arrive same-period.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer volatility resurgence: Period 27 demand (301) spiked +17% vs P24-26 avg, causing a stockout and interrupting the cooling trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Aug 26. Demand stabilized ~297 in P27-28 after a dip. Using recent_N=6 for mu/sigma captures the late-summer cooling (avg ~290) while retaining enough safety stock for 301+ spikes seen in P27. Low on-hand (29) requires immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer stabilization: Demand in P27-P28 hovered near ~297 units, correcting the sharp dip seen in P25-26, suggesting a "soft landing" rather than a continued crash in demand as summer ends.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (Sep 2) marks the transition from summer store-set to autumn. Demand for trainer socks (typically a warm-weather item) is showing signs of cooling further, with Period 29 dropping to 229 units, the lowest since early March. The recent average (last 4 periods P26-P29) is ~270 units, significantly lower than the ~305 June/July baseline. Volatility remains present (P27 spiked to 301, P29 dipped to 229), so we cannot cut stock too aggressively yet. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this cooling trend (~270 avg) while maintaining a robust safety stock via N=4 sigma estimation to cover residual late-summer volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn cooling confirmed: Period 29 demand dropped to 229 (lowest since March), dragging the 4-week average down to ~270 units, indicating the seasonal transition away from summer trainer socks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Early September): We are seeing a confirmed seasonal shift as we transition from summer to autumn. Demand for trainer socks has settled into a lower regime (avg ~271 over P26-P30) compared to the summer stable baseline of ~306. Although Period 30 (274 units) rebounded from the sharp dip in Period 29 (229 units), the overall level is consistently below the July peaks. Lead time remains reliable at 0. Using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility parameters captures this new autumn baseline (approx 270 units) while smoothing out single-period noise like the extreme low in P29 or the stockout-inducing spike in P27.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline established: Demand has stabilized around ~270 units (P26-P30 avg ~271), confirming the step-down from the >300 unit summer regime, with volatility moderating into a 230-300 range.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (mid-September) marks the continuation of the Autumn season. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is confirming a downward/cooling trend expected for this product category as weather cools. Recent demand (P29-P31) has averaged ~252 units, slightly lower than the late-August average of ~270, with volatility settling into a range of 229-274. To effectively manage this lower-volume regime without overstocking (holding cost $1.0 applies), we use a short moving average (N=4) for both demand mean and variance. N=4 captures the most recent month of Autumn transition data (P28-P31), smoothing the dip in P29 with the mild recovery in P30, while excluding high Summer peak data that is no longer relevant. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline adjustment: Mid-Sept demand (P29-P31) averaging ~252 units suggests the seasonal floor is settling lower than the initial ~270 estimate from late August.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand shock (405 units) broke the cooling trend (previous avg ~251) and caused a stockout. This spike resembles peak summer demand. To recover service level without fully committing to a high-volume regime based on one data point, we use mu_hat/sigma_hat with N=6. This captures the spike's impact on variance (increasing safety stock) while keeping the mean estimate moderate (~284). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Autumn volatility shock: Demand spiked to 405 units (+60% vs recent avg), shattering the stabilizing trend (~251 units) seen in early Sept and causing a stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7) sees continued high volatility (P33: 405, P34: 312) contradicting the early Sept cooling trend. To prevent further stockouts like P33, I am switching to a highly responsive N=3 for both demand and volatility to capture the current active regime (~322 avg) rather than the lower long-term autumn baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Autumn Volatility Resurgence: Late Sept/early Oct demand (avg ~358 in P33-34) has sharply diverged from the early Sept cooling trend (~251), requiring responsive parameters to manage erratic spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $941.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (mid-October) sees demand returning to the lower autumn baseline (P35=266) after the volatility spike in P33-34. The product (trainer socks) typically cools in demand during autumn. However, the recent stockout in P33 (405 units) demonstrates that sudden spikes are still possible. To balance the risk of holding costs against another potential spike, we use a 5-period window (N=5) for both mean and volatility. This incorporates the high variance of P33/34 while weighing it against the lower baseline of P31/32/35, resulting in a forecasted mean (~297) that buffers slightly above the most recent observation. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline return: Period 35 demand (266) snapped back to the early Sept levels (~250-270), suggesting the P33-34 surge (avg ~358) was likely intermittent volatility rather than a sustained new regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Late October (Period 37). Demand for trainer socks is exhibiting a strong seasonal cooling trend, dropping sequentially from 312 (P34) to 240 (P36). The P33-P34 volatility spike appears to have been a transient event, with the recent two periods averaging ~253 units, well below the summer levels. 

Method choice: I select 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Reasoning: Recent demand (P35-36) suggests a forecast around 250 units. However, the critical ratio (Profit=4, Holding=1) favors service level over inventory reduction. Using N=4 captures the high volatility from P33 (405 units) within the calculation, producing a more robust target (~306 units) and higher safety stock. This protects against potential late-season spikes while allowing inventory to slowly adjust downward if the cooling trend holds.

Carry-over insight: Deep Autumn demand contraction: Sequential sustained decline confirmed over 3 periods (P34: 312 -> P35: 266 -> P36: 240), establishing a new lower regime (avg < 260) consistent with seasonal end-of-lift for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1163.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (Late October): The previous hypothesis of a 'deep autumn contraction' was challenged by Period 37 demand rebouding to 306 units (up from 240 in P36). While a seasonal cooling trend is expected for trainer socks, the recent data shows high volatility (last 5 periods range: 240-405) rather than a linear decline. Demand exceeded 300 units in 3 of the last 5 periods. With a high cost of stockout ($4 profit vs $1 holding), relying on a short-term declining average (N=3 ~270) is risky. I am selecting N=5 for mean and volatility to incorporate the higher demand signals (P33, P34, P37) and ensure the base stock covers potential rebounding demand (~306 avg). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn contraction interrupted: Demand rebounded to 306 in P37, breaking the sequential decline pattern seen in P34-P36. Volatility remains high (last 5 periods range 240-405), requiring buffers over pure trend following.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) marks deep Autumn. Demand for trainer socks has stabilized into a consistent regime over the last 5 weeks (P34-P38), averaging 280 units with a defined range of 240-312. This baseline is lower than the Summer peaks but distinctly recovered from the mid-September dip. The extreme outlier in P33 (405 units) is now 6 weeks past and less predictive of the current stable oscillation. We select N=5 for both mean and volatility to accurately capture this recent 'Autumn Baseline' (Mean ~280, StDev ~28) while filtering out the older, irrelevant shock. This sets a target stock level sufficient to cover the upper end of the recent 312-unit range given the high service requirement (critical ratio 0.8), without overstocking for a cooling seasonal category.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stabilization confirmed (Nov): Demand oscillating in 240-312 range (P34-P38 avg ~280), establishing a steady baseline below Summer peaks, effectively moving past the Sept volatility shocks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 40 (2019-11-11). Context: Mid-Autumn. The product (trainer socks) is in its off-peak season. Analysis of recent history (P36-P39) confirms a stabilized, lower demand regime compared to summer peaks. Demand in this 4-week window has averaged ~266 units (range 240-306), significantly below the ~400 unit variances of early autumn or ~430 peaks of spring. The recent volatility shock in P33-34 has largely subsided, with demand settling into a predictable band (240-270 range for 3 of last 4 periods, with one outlier of 306). Given the consistent 0-period lead time performance and no missing shipment signals, I will maintain 'recent_N' for demand estimation but reduce N to 4 to tightly track this specific November baseline, filtering out the earlier October volatility. A safety stock buffer is maintained via the backend's service level calculation to handle minor fluctuations like P37.

Carry-over insight: November baseline confirmed: Demand stabilized in 240-280 range (P36-P39 avg ~266), distinctly lower than Summer/Early Autumn volatile periods. Low-volatility off-peak regime established.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (mid-November) confirms the low-volume off-season regime for trainer socks. Demand in Period 40 (252 units) aligns perfectly with the recent 5-period average (~263 units) and the subdued volatility of late Autumn. With winter approaching, demand has stabilized at this lower floor (approx 240-270 range) compared to summer peaks. Lead times remain consistently 0. We select N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this stable November baseline while maintaining a slight buffer against latent volatility (skewed by P37).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Late November) marks the start of the holiday retail peak (Black Friday / Cyber Monday). While recent demand (P39-P41) has been seasonally low (avg ~234) for trainer socks, the calendar date of 2019/11/25 suggests an imminent spike in retail traffic. Historically, this SKU is volatile, and the holiday season often drives gift/stocking-stuffer purchases even for basic items. I will maintain responsiveness using a short recent_N=4 to capture the slight downward trend (~234) but combine it with a boosted sigma_hat (using recent high volatility periods or expanding N slightly) to prepare for holiday shocks. Actually, given the dip to 210 in P41, a pure recent_N might under-forecast if Black Friday hits this week. I will use recent_N=4 for mu (avg ~245) to reflect the baseline but stick to recent_N=6 for sigma to capture the wider range including the Oct 306 peak, keeping safety stock healthy for the upcoming rush. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season onset: Late Nov (P42) demand expected to rise or exhibit volatility due to Black Friday; recent low baseline (~234) may be the calm before the storm.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (Dec 2) captures the immediate post-Black Friday context. Period 42 demand spiked to 354 units (+68% vs P41), causing a stockout and confirming the onset of holiday season volatility. While P41 (210) was a seasonal low, the P42 spike indicates a regime shift towards higher variance and volume for December. I am selecting 'recent_N' (N=3) for both demand and volatility. This incorporates the spike into the standard deviation (~75 units), pushing the safety stock calculation higher (target pipe ~395) to cover potential Cyber Monday/Holiday peaks, while the mean (~272) bridges the gap between the Nov lull and the Dec surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility onset confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 354 units (+68% vs P41) due to Black Friday, shattering the stable Nov baseline (~240). Expect erratic, elevated demand through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand dropped sharply to 143 (whiplash from P42 Black Friday spike). Relying solely on this low signal risks stockouts for pre-Christmas shopping. Using recent_N=6 for mu/sigma smooths the P42 spike and P43 dip, maintaining a baseline ~246 that protects service level against erratic holiday variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday whiplash confirmed: Demand plummeted to 143 in P43 (-60% vs P42 peak), showcasing extreme holiday volatility. Forecasts must smooth these spikes (N=6) to hold inventory for remaining December shopping.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Dec 16 (Period 45). History shows extreme recent volatility (P42 Black Friday spike to 354 -> P43 drop to 143 -> P44 recovery to 209). As we enter the final shopping week before Christmas, demand is unpredictable; trainer socks are off-peak in winter but may see gift-buying spikes. A short N=3 captures only the chaos; extending to N=6 (covering stable Nov weeks + recent volatility) yields a mean (~235) that bridges the pre-holiday baseline and recent swings, while a high sigma buffers against potential pre-Christmas stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Christmas volatility confirmed: Demand recovered to 209 in P44 (vs 143 in P43), but remains below the November baseline (~250). Extreme short-term variance (143-354 range in 3 weeks) necessitates wider observation windows (N=6) to average out holiday noise.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
It is Dec 23 (P46). Demand has stabilized/recovered (231 units in P45) after the extreme holiday volatility of early Dec. I am using N=3 for the mean to track this recent recovery trend (avg ~194 but rising) while ignoring the Black Friday spike which is now past. For volatility (sigma), I retain N=6 to include the recent high variance (P42-P44) in the safety stock calculation, protecting against final holiday uncertainties before the expected January drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Christmas recovery stabilization: Demand sequentially recovering (143 -> 209 -> 231 in P43-P45) following the post-Black Friday dip, establishing a pre-Christmas baseline of ~220 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Dec 30, 2019. We are in the immediate post-Christmas week (New Year's Eve/Day). Period 46 demand (224) and Period 45 (231) show a stable but low-volume winter baseline for these trainer socks, significantly below Summer peaks (350+). The Black Friday spike (P42: 354) and subsequent crash (P43: 143) have smoothed out. 

Looking ahead: January is typically a clearance or low-demand month for summer-oriented items like trainer socks, though 'New Year, New Me' gym resolutions can create a mild bump. The recent 3-period average is ~221 units (P44-46). Given the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), protecting against a New Year gym spike is worth the small carrying cost, but we don't need holiday-level buffers. 

Parameters: I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this stabilized post-Christmas baseline (avg ~221) while reacting quickly if Jan demand drops further. N=6 is no longer needed as the extreme Black Friday volatility has exited a 3-week window. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday baseline established: Demand stabilized at ~221 units (P44-46 avg) following the Black Friday/Christmas volatility, confirming a quiet winter regime for trainer socks.
