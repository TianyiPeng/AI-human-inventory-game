Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Current date is Feb 11, 2019. Product (Imitation Leather Leggings) is a cold-weather fashion item. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 70 units/week with a standard deviation of ~11.5. Last week's demand (57) was below average. As this is the first period, we assume the promised lead time of 0 periods holds true. We set varying parameters based on the full 5-week history provided to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18). Confirmed actual lead time matches promised (0 periods) based on Period 1 arrival. Demand in Period 1 (50) continues a downward trend observed in pre-game history (57, down from 81), likely due to seasonality (imitation leather leggings approaching end of winter). On-hand inventory is 30, which is below the recent average demand. Utilizing recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent lower demand values (81, 57, 50) more heavily than early January peaks, while accounting for the increased volatility of the downward shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (Feb 25) context: Observed a stockout in Period 2 where demand (83) exceeded available inventory (77). This confirms that demand can spike significantly above the recent dip seen in Period 1 (50). The product (imitation leather leggings) is currently in season (late Feb). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) in both P1 and P2, so we maintain the default L. For demand parameters, we switch to 'recent_N' with N=5. This rolling window captures the high volatility (samples: 67, 81, 57, 50, 83) more accurately than the lifetime average, increasing sigma_hat to buffer against further spikes like the one seen in P2.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: rapid shift from 50 (P1) to 83 (P2) causing stockout. Upside risk remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (early March). Demand for imitation leather leggings continues to fluctuate significantly (P1:50, P2:83, P3:70) but centers around a mean of ~68 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 (instant arrival), simplifying planning. Given the high volatility observed in the last 5 weeks (ranging from 50 to 83), I am using a recent_N=5 window for both mean and standard deviation to capture the current erratic demand profile while filtering out older January data. Service level targets covering ~84% of demand spectrum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (March 11) context: Product is imitation leather leggings, likely seeing demand soften slightly as spring approaches, though recent volatility remains. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand history shows a stabilizing trend after the P2 spike (83 -> 70 -> 61). Setting L to default (0). Using recent_N=4 for demand parameters (mean ~66, std dev ~14) to capture the immediate past month's activity, which balances the P2 spike against the lower P1 demand. This ensures high service level (critical ratio 0.8) while adapting to the apparent stabilization around 60-70 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (March 18). Lead time reliably 0 (orders consistently arrive same period). Demand in Periods 3-5 stabilized in the 61-70 range (avg ~66), though Period 2 saw a spike to 83 causing a stockout. Given the high profit margin (0.8 service level target), avoiding stockouts is priority. Selected mu_hat using recent_N=4 (avg 70) to include the P2 spike while excluding the initial low of P1 (50). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (std ~12) to capture the full volatility of the game history for safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilizing: P3-P5 avg 65.6 (range 61-70), showing reduced volatility compared to P1-P2 start.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (Mar 25). Current inventory is 30 units, with 0 in-transit. Demand history shows a recent average of ~63 units/period over the last 6 periods (range 50-83). However, the most recent demand in Period 6 dropped to 51, the lowest since Period 1. This could signal the beginning of a seasonal decline for 'imitation leather leggings' as Spring starts (late March). Given the high service level target (critical ratio 0.8) and history of volatility (max 83), we must guard against stockouts while acknowledging slightly lower recent activity. The 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=5 to capture stability excluding the P1 dip and P2 partial spike) and sigma_hat (N=5) remains prudent to react to the recent mean shift (~60s). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 corresponds to April 1st. The product is 'imitation leather leggings', a cold-weather item. Demand has shown a significant downward trend over the last 3 periods (66 -> 51 -> 39), with Period 7 marking a new low. This strongly suggests the end of the selling season. Lead time remains stable at 0. To prevent excess inventory accumulation as demand fades ($1 holding cost is significant), I am switching to a short-memory forecast (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the decline rapidly, while maintaining a slightly longer window (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for residual volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline confirmed: Demand dropped to 39 in Period 7 (lowest recorded), consistent with Spring arrival reducing demand for leather leggings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8) represents mid-Spring, creating significant seasonality headwinds for imitation leather leggings. Demand in P8 (47) and P7 (39) confirms a sustained drop from the Feb/early-March highs (avg ~67). The current Spring baseline appears to be settling in the 40-50 range. To avoid overstocking an out-of-season item, I am switching parameters to 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus exclusively on this lower demand regime (P6-P8 avg ~45.7) and discard the irrelevant winter peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand baseline established: P6-P8 demand averages 45.7 units (range 39-51), effectively replacing the winter regime (avg ~67).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April) confirms the 'Spring Demand' regime stability. Demand over the last 4 periods (P6-P9) has averaged 45.5 units (range 39-51), significantly lower than the winter peak. With the product being imitation leather leggings, demand is expected to remain low or slowly taper as weather warms. Immediate replenishment is required as on-hand inventory is critically low (6 units). I am using 'recent_N=4' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current spring baseline (excluding the high winter data from Period 5 and earlier) and to calculate appropriate safety stock for the high service level target (Profit:Holding ratio 4:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, confirming the product (imitation leather leggings) is continuing its seasonal exit into warmer weather. Demand in Period 10 dropped significantly to 29 units, the lowest recorded, breaking the prior 'Spring plateau' of ~45 units. Given the high holding cost relative to profit (critical ratio 0.8), avoiding overstock is crucial as we approach Summer. I am switching to a tighter N=4 for demand estimation to reflect this accelerated decline (avg ~40, down from ~45). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline accelerating: Period 10 demand (29) is a new low, pulling the P7-P10 average down to 40 units, significantly below the prior P6-P9 baseline of 45.7.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (April 29): The seasonal decline for 'Fake leather leggings' is aggressively continuing as spring deepens. Demand has dropped sequentially for four consecutive weeks: 47 -> 45 -> 29 -> 22. The most recent demand (22 units) is the lowest recorded in history. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 35.75, but the last 2 periods average only 25.5. Given the clear downward trend and the nature of the product (garment for cold weather), reverting to a 'recent_N' average using older data (like P7-P9) would overestimate demand. The most prudent approach is to follow the recent downward trajectory closely. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (P9-P11 avg: (45+29+22)/3 = 32), which balances the sharp drop with a slight buffer against a single outlier low. The standard deviation remains relatively stable but low in this new regime, so tracking the recent volatility is appropriate. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal collapse confirmed: Demand for leather leggings has plummeted to a new low of 22 in Period 11, with the 4-week moving average dropping to 35.75 from the winter peak of ~70.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6th) reinforces the off-season status for 'Imitation Leather Leggings'. Demand in Period 12 (29 units) was slightly higher than Period 11 (22 units) but remains firmly in the low spring baseline, far below winter levels (60-80). The most recent 5-period average (P8-P12) is 34.4 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 10.6. Given the confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I will forecast for L+1=1 period using the recent N=5 average to capture this lower spring demand while maintaining safety stock for minor fluctuations like the slight uptick in P12. The downward trend is stabilized but at a very low level consistent with the season.

Carry-over insight: Spring baseline stabilized: Demand P8-P12 averages 34.4 units, confirming a low-volume off-season regime compared to winter highs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13th (Period 14). Product is faux leather leggings, a winter-focused item entering its off-season. Demand has stabilized at a low trough (range 22-32) over the last 4 periods, averaging 28 units/period. The transitional demand of 45 in Period 9 is now an outlier to the current 'low' regime. I am effectively filtering out older high-demand data to prevent overstocking during the summer months where holding costs are punitive relative to the reduced sales velocity. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Off-season trough established: P10-P13 demand averages 28 units, confirming minimal summer demand for winter apparel (leather leggings).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) reinforces the off-season 'summer trough' for leather leggings. Demand in Period 14 (35 units) exceeded on-hand inventory (32 units), causing a stockout. While the general trend is low-volume (P10-P14 average ~29.4 units), the recent stockout indicates that volatility remains relative to the lower mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this stabilized annual low (the 'new normal' of ~30 units) while accounting for the variance demonstrated by the P14 distinct uptick (35 vs prior 22-32 range). Default lead time (0) remains accurate.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline stabilized: P10-P14 demand averages 29.4 units, confirming a low-volume trough compared to winter peaks, though local volatility (range 22-35) persists.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (Late May). Demand has stabilized around a 'summer floor' in the low 30s (recent 3-period avg: 33.7), recovering slightly from the April bottom. However, holding zero inventory led to stockouts in P14 and P15, validating that current settings are too lean for the residual volatility. Current strategy: Adjust mu_hat to N=3 to reflect the recent uptick/plateau (avg ~34) rather than the deeper drop. Expand sigma_hat to N=6 to incorporate the volatility of the recent trough (including P11's drop to 22) into the safety stock, ensuring coverage up to ~38 units to prevent recurring stockouts while maintaining lean off-season execution. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Off-season floor established: Demand P13-P15 averages 33.7 units, confirming stabilization after the spring collapse. Sequential stockouts in P14-P15 indicate that while volume is low, local variance requires a buffer above the absolute mean.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3 (Summer). Despite the off-season, demand has shown surprising resilience and an upward trend over the last 3 weeks (35, 34, 43), significantly exceeding the April trough (~28). This surge has caused three consecutive periods of zero ending inventory (stockouts in P14, P16). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), urgent parameter adjustment is needed to recover safety stock. I am switching to recent_N=5 to raise the demand forecast (avg ~34.6) and volatility estimate, acknowledging that the deep spring trough has passed or was temporary.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand resilience: Demand P14-P16 averaged 37.3 units, significantly changing the regime from the P10-P13 trough (avg 28) and causing persistent stockouts. The off-season floor is higher and more volatile than initially established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10 (Summer); demand for leather leggings remains in a low-volume trough (avg ~33.4 over last 5 periods) but exhibits high relative volatility (range 23-43). Recent stockouts (P14-P16) were resolved in P17 due to a demand drop to 23. We proceed with parameters based on the last 5 periods to capture this specific summer volatility without overstocking for winter levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility persists in off-season: while the P13-P17 mean is low (33.4), the range (23-43) indicates high relative variance, requiring safety stock buffers despite the summer trough.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (mid-June) represents deep off-season for leather leggings. Demand has dropped sharply in the last two periods (P17: 23, P18: 17), averaging 20 units, which is significantly lower than the May volatility spike (P14-P16 avg: 37.3). However, given the recent history of sudden spikes (e.g., P16's 43 units) and the high cost of stocking out (Profit/Holding ratio = 4), we must avoid over-correcting to the low side too aggressively. We utilize a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu and sigma. This sets a forecast baseline around ~30 units with high variance, providing a safety buffer that covers potential random spikes while acknowledging the downward summer trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump deepening: Early June demand (P17-P18) averages 20.0 units, a sharp decline from the May average of 37.3, suggesting the off-season trough has resumed after the late-spring volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (Late June) represents deep summer, where demand for faux leather leggings is historically lowest. The last three periods (P17-P19) show a consistent, stabilized low-volume regime with an average demand of ~19.3 units (range 17-23), a distinct drop from the volatile May numbers (which averaged ~37). Continuing with the previous regime's volatility (P14-P16) would result in significant overstocking during the off-season. Therefore, I am switching to a highly responsive `recent_N` = 3 for both demand and volatility to align inventory strictly with this new summer trough. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough stabilizing: June demand (P17-P19) averages 19.3 units with low variance (range 17-23), confirming a distinct low-volume regime compared to the erratic Spring transition.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 is July 1st, deep into the summer off-season for fake leather leggings. Demand has hit an all-time low of 11 units in Period 20, breaking the previous stability range (17-23). The most recent 4-week period (P17-P20) represents a distinct 'Summer Trough' regime with an average demand of ~17.3 units and significantly reduced variance compared to the Spring transition (P16 and prior). I am selecting recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to tightly calibrate the forecast to this low-volume summer baseline, excluding the P16 outlier (43 units). Short lead time (0 periods) remains consistent, so 'default' is retained.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand hits new low: Period 20 demand fell to 11, breaking the previous P17-P19 stability range (17-23) and lowering the June 4-week average to 17.3, confirming deep off-season apathy.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) places us firmly in the off-season for leather leggings. The observed demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has averaged 17.6 units with a range of 11-23. The most recent demand (P21) was 19. The carry-over insights correctly identify a summer trough regime. I will calibrate the forecast using the recent summer data (last 5 periods) to avoid overstocking during this low-demand season while maintaining enough coverage for the local variance (std dev ~4.6 units). The critical ratio is 4/(4+1) = 0.8, meaning we aim for high service, but the absolute volume is low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture this stabilized summer low. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed: P17-P21 demand avg 17.6, range 11-23, reinforcing minimal off-season volume.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 represents mid-July, which is deep off-season for leather leggings. Demand has stabilized at a low summer floor. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand averaged 17.3 units with a range of 11-23. The most recent 3 periods averaged 15.3 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. To optimize profit (Critical Ratio = 0.8) while minimizing holding costs during this low-volume period, I will use a short moving average (N=6) for both mean and volatility. This window (P17-P22) captures the current 'summer trough' regime while including the slight volatility observed in early June (23 units) to maintain an adequate safety stock buffer against minor spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor stable: P17-P22 demand averages 17.3 units (range 11-23), consistently significantly below the winter average (~67), confirming the seasonal trough is steady.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22, 2019): We are in the deep off-season for 'fake leather leggings' (winter apparel). The most recent demand (Period 23) was 9 units, a new low, reinforcing the summer trough pattern. The 4-week average (P20-P23) is approximately 13.8 units/period. The overall summer baseline (P17-P23) averages around 16.1 units. High volatility has subsided slightly, but demand remains erratic at these low volumes (range 9-23 since late May). Promised lead time holds at 0. Given the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), maintaining a high service level is optimal (ratio 0.8), but the absolute demand level is very low. I will set mu_hat to a short-term average (recent_N=4) to capture the current trough of ~14 units, while keeping sigma robust (recent_N=7) to account for the occasional spike up to ~23 units seen earlier in June.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepens: P23 demand of 9 units sets a new minimum record, lowering the 4-week average to 13.8 (P20-P23) against a wider summer avg of ~17. This confirms minimal interest in leather leggings during peak summer.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: July 29 (Mid-Summer). Observation: Period 24 demand dropped to 7 units, the lowest recorded in history, confirming the absolute depth of the summer trough for winter leather leggings. Analysis: The 4-week moving average (P21-P24) has fallen to 12.75 units. While demand is minimal, relative volatility remains significant (range 7-19 in the last month), and the high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding) justifies maintaining coverage for occasional spikes (like P21's 19 units). Action: We continue with 'recent_N' (N=4) for both mean and volatility to reflect this low-volume, erratic summer regime accurately. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough bottoms out: Period 24 demand hit 7 units (new record low). P21-P24 average is 12.8, confirming negligible off-season demand for winter leggings.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context (August 5): We are in the depths of late summer, the absolute off-season for faux leather leggings. Demand has reached a new record low of 4 units in Period 25. The last four periods (P22-P25) show a decaying trend: 16 -> 9 -> 7 -> 4, averaging just 9.0 units. The wider summer trough (P20-P25) averages 11.0 units. With on-hand inventory at 14 units, we likely have enough coverage for the next period unless a random spike occurs, but given the critical fractile of 0.8 (high service level target), we must maintain a base stock that covers potential upset. I will adopt a very short-term 'recent_N' forecast (N=4) to capture this specific deep-summer trough (avg ~9) while maintaining a robust sigma (N=4) to guard against the relative volatility, since demand could swing back to ~15-20 without warning. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough bottoms out: P25 demand hit record low 4 units. Recent trend (P22-P25) averages 9.0 units, confirming negligible demand for winter leggings in August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand spiked to 16, breaking the deep summer trough trend (previous 3-period avg ~6.6) and causing a stockout. This correlates with the mid-August date (2019/8/12), signaling the start of the 'Back to School' / Autumn seasonal recovery for leggings. Averaging methods (recent_N) would significantly under-forecast due to the recent lows (4, 7). Therefore, I am switching to explicit forecasting to aggressively capture the upward inflection and prevent further service failures during this seasonal transition. I estimate mean demand recovering to ~18 with higher volatility (sigma=10) to buffer against the rapid regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal inflection detected: Period 26 demand jumped to 16 (from low of 4), signaling end of summer trough and start of Autumn recovery.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Autumn recovery is accelerating faster than historical averages can capture. Demand jumped 4 -> 16 -> 27 in three weeks. Using explicit forecast of 32 for mu_hat (projecting continued growth above current 27) and explicit sigma_hat of 12 to reflect the high volatility of the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up active: Demand surged from 4 (P25) to 27 (P27), confirming the end of the summer trough and the start of the seasonal ascent.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) confirms the seasonal shift for leather leggings is well underway. Demand in Period 28 (22 units) sustained the higher volume seen in P27 (27 units) and P26 (16 units), validating that the summer trough (single-digit demand) is over. The new regime (P26-P28) reflects the 'Autumn ramp-up' identified in previous insights. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to strictly focus on these post-inflection periods (avg ~21.7), ignoring the irrelevant low-demand data from July. This ensures the forecast adapts quickly to the rising seasonal trend while accounting for the local volatility (range 16-27).

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: P26-P28 demand averages 21.7 units (range 16-27), firmly establishing a new seasonal baseline well above the summer trough (avg ~9).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 2nd. The product (Leggings) is entering its prime Autumn/Winter season. Demand in the last 4 periods (P26-P29) averages 20.0 units, significantly higher than the summer trough (avg ~9), confirming the seasonal recovery is active despite a slight dip to 15 in P29. While volatility is present (range 15-27), the regime has clearly shifted away from summer lows. I am applying a short memory (recent_N=4) for both demand mean and volatility to capture this ongoing strictly seasonal ramp-up while discarding irrelevant summer data. Service level targets 80% (ratio 0.8) to balance profit against holding costs during this ascent.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal ramp-up acceleration: Period 30 demand spiked to 39 (up from P29's 15 and summer lows of <10), confirming the Autumn ascent is gaining momentum toward winter peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Sep 16). The autumn ramp-up is now undeniable and accelerating. Demand in Period 31 hit 46 units, following 39 in Period 30, both significantly above the summer trough (avg ~9). We have stocked out for two consecutive periods (P30, P31) because the backend 'recent_N' logic is lagging behind the rapid velocity of the seasonal ascent (averaging in lower values from late August). To break this cycle of stockouts during the critical seasonal ramp-up, I am switching to 'explicit' forecasting. The last 3 periods (P29-P31) show demand of 15, 39, 46. The upward trend is steep. Anticipating demand will continue to rise or stabilize near 50-55 as autumn deepens. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 55 to capture this trend and ensure the base stock calculation (which targets service level) has a sufficient mean to work with. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ascent confirmed: Demand reached 46 in Period 31, rapidly climbing from summer lows. Consecutive stockouts indicate standard averages are lagging the seasonal trend.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (late September) confirms a strong autumnal demand surge for leather leggings. Demand has risen consecutively for 3 periods (39 -> 46 -> 51), clearly exiting the summer trough. Trailing averages (e.g., 3-period avg ~45) are lagging this rapid ascent, evidenced by consecutive stockouts in P30-P31. With a high criticality ratio (Profit 4.0 vs Holding 1.0), maximizing service level is paramount. I am switching mu_hat to 'explicit' to forecast continued growth (projecting 56 units) rather than reacting to history, aiming to reach a base stock comparable to the winter peak (historical max 83). Sigma uses recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the ramp-up phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up accelerating: Demand P30-P32 (39, 46, 51) shows strong consecutive growth, approaching winter levels (avg ~67 in P1-P4). Trend requires explicit forecasting to prevent lag-induced stockouts as trailing averages underestimate the slope.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sep 30) - Peak season explosion confirmed. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 119 units, shattering previous records (Jan/Feb max was 83) and more than doubling the prior period (51). This signals a violent transition to high-volume Autumn/Winter demand for faux leather leggings. The previous gradual 'ramp-up' tracking failed to catch this surge, causing a massive stockout (49 sales lost). Strategy shifts to highly reactive tracking (N=3) to incorporate the 119 observation immediately into both the mean (raising forecast to ~72) and variance (increasing safety stock heavily). With a 4:1 critical ratio favoring sales, recovering service level is the priority.

Carry-over insight: Peak Season Explosion: Period 33 demand hit 119 units, exceeding all historical records (winter peak ~83). This establishes a new high-volume, high-volatility regime for Q4, invalidating prior stabilization baselines.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7): Peak season is fully active. Recent demand (P31-P34: 46, 51, 119, 78) averages 73.5 with high variance. The extreme spike in P33 (119) and sustained high in P34 (78) confirm a high-volume regime significantly above Q1 levels. Using recent_N=4 for both mean and volatility to remain responsive to this aggressive autumn ramp-up and prevent stockouts seen in P30/31/33.

Carry-over insight: Peak season volatility confirmed: Period 33-34 demand (119, 78) averages ~98.5, far exceeding the P1-P4 winter baseline (~67), proving the Q4 surge is stronger than the Q1 tail.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (mid-October) reinforces the high-volume Autumn/Winter regime. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 119, 78, 84) averages ~93.7 units, significantly higher than the summer trough (<10) and even the early year winter baseline (~67). The volatility is high (sigma ~20+), driven by the sharp spike in P33. With on-hand inventory low at 18 units and lead time consistently 0 periods, we must set parameters aggressive enough to cover the mean demand plus a safety margin for the volatile peak season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this immediate high-volume shift without being dragged down by the low September numbers. The goal is to maintain high service levels (critical ratio 0.8) during this peak profit season.

Carry-over insight: Peak season intensity sustained: P33-P35 demand averages 93.7 units, confirming a new high-volume regime significantly above the Q1 winter baseline (~67).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21) marks the consolidation of the Autumn/Winter peak season. Demand in Period 36 was 57, a dip from the recent highs (119, 78, 84), potentially noise or a brief breather before the holiday rush likely starting late Oct/early Nov given the 'Leggings' category. The recent average (P33-P36) is 84.5 units, significantly higher than the summer trough. The standard deviation over this peak period is high (~25). I will use a conservative recent_N=4 estimator for the mean to capture this high-volume regime (avg ~84.5) while smoothing the dip to 57, ensuring we don't understock for the imminent Q4 peak. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Peak instability detected: Period 36 demand dropped to 57 after three high weeks (avg 94), suggesting high week-to-week volatility within the high-volume Q4 regime. P33-P36 average remains high at 84.5.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 corresponds to late October (Halloween week), a peak time for faux leather leggings. Demand rebounded to 85 in Period 37, erasing the dip seen in Period 36 (57) and confirming that the high-volume Q4 regime remains active. The average demand over the new peak regime (P33-P37) is 84.6 units, with significant volatility (range 57-119). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), avoiding stockouts is critical. I am updating forecasts to use the last 5 periods (since the breakout in P33) to capture this aggressive seasonal mean and volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak regime resilience confirmed: Period 37 demand rebounded to 85 units, normalizing the P36 dip (57) as noise. The 5-week peak season average (P33-P37) stands at 84.6 units, establishing a robust high-volume baseline significantly above year-start levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) reinforces the peak Q4 season. Period 38 demand surged to 108 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This invalidates the temporary stabilization seen in P36-P37 and indicates demand is oscillating near the high end of the regime (P33 was 119). The 6-week average is ~88.5, but this is dampened by the P36 outlier (57). Given the stockout and the high cost of lost sales ($4 margin vs $1 holding), we adopt an aggressive explicit forecast of 100 units (closer to the P33/P38 peaks) to ensure service levels during November. Sigma is calculated using the last 6 periods to capture the full extent of the 57-119 volatility range.

Carry-over insight: Peak season acceleration: Period 38 demand hit 108, demonstrating that the Q4 regime sustains levels >100 (matching P33's 119). The volatility range (57-119) is extreme, making average-based forecasting prone to stockouts in high-demand weeks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is mid-Q4, approaching peak winter retail events (Black Friday). Demand remains in a high-volume, high-volatility regime established in Period 33. The last 7 weeks (P33-P39) show an average demand of ~86 units, but with extreme variance (range 57-119). P39 demand (70) was a dip following the P38 spike (108), consistent with the recent 'sawtooth' volatility pattern. I am employing 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu and sigma to capture this entire high-demand window (starting from the initial surge in P33), ensuring the base stock accounts for the potential 100+ unit peaks seen in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Peak volatility pattern persists: Demand oscillates significantly week-to-week (e.g., P38 108 -> P39 70), but the 7-week average (P33-P39) remains robust at ~86, confirming sustained high-volume Q4 regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (mid-November) continues the high-volume Peak Season regime for faux leather leggings. Recent demand (P33-P40) is averaging ~84.4 units, with significant volatility (range 57-119). Although P39/P40 normalized slightly (70, 74), the approach to Black Friday and December suggests upside risk remains dominant. The current on-hand inventory (30) is low relative to the average demand, exposing us to stockout risk if another spike like P33 (119) or P38 (108) occurs. I will use 'recent_N=8' (since the P33 surge) to capture the full scope of this high-volume regime while smoothing the week-to-week oscillations (119 vs 57). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak season plateau: Demand P37-P40 averages 84.3, stabilizing around the P33-P36 breakout average (~84.5), confirming a sustained high-volume plateau before potential holiday intensification.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25-Dec 1) encompasses Black Friday (Nov 29), typically the highest demand week for retail apparel. While the Q4 peak regime (P33-P41) averages 86 units, recent momentum (P40: 74 -> P41: 93) and the calendar event suggest demand will likely exceed the average and challenge the period max (119). To prevent stockouts during this high-margin event (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting an explicit forecast of 110 units (near recent peaks) rather than relying on trailing averages which lag the holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal baseline confirmed: P33-P41 demand averages 86.4 units (range 57-119), establishing a sustained high-volume winter regime significantly above early-year levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Black Friday week) saw a massive demand spike to 191 units, doubling the recent Q4 average. We are now in December (Period 43), where demand remains high but likely below the specific Black Friday peak. Using a 5-period average (capturing P38-P42) sets the forecast around 107 units, balancing the extreme spike with the sustained high-volume winter baseline. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday Spike confirmed: Period 42 demand hit 191 units (+100% vs recent avg), shattering previous records. This establishes the seasonal peak, likely followed by a return to the high-volume Q4 baseline (~90-110) rather than sustaining 190+.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (Dec 9). We are in the peak holiday shopping window. Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 191), Period 43 demand remained very high at 128 units, confirming that the high-volume regime persists into December. This is significantly above the November pre-holiday average (~85). The cost of stockouts (lost profit $4) far exceeds holding cost ($1), justifying an aggressive inventory stance. I am using `recent_N=4` to capture the elevated mean (~121 units) and the high volatility (sigma ~51) introduced by the holiday surge, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover potential spikes up to ~165 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday momentum confirmed: Period 43 demand (128) remained elevated post-Black Friday, confirming a high-volume December regime (avg ~120+) distinct from the pre-holiday plateau (~85).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) is deep within the peak winter season for leather leggings. Historical data shows demand sustaining high volume post-Black Friday. Period 44 demand was 137, confirming the P42-P44 average of 152 units/week (driven by the holiday rush). With Christmas next week, demand intensity remains critical. Recent demand samples (191, 128, 137) suggest a very high mean. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures this immediate holiday peak volatility (avg ~152) far better than longer averages. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will aggressively target this high mean to cover the final holiday surge before the January drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak intensity sustained: Demand P42-P44 averages 152 units (range 128-191), confirming a distinct 'Holiday Rush' regime significantly higher than the pre-Black Friday plateau (~86).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents December 23rd, the final week immediately preceding Christmas. Demand in recent periods (P42, P43, P44, P45) has been extremely high: 191 (Black Friday), 128, 137, 137. This creates a solid high-volume holiday baseline averaging ~148 units over the last 4 weeks. Given the date is Dec 23, we are at the absolute peak of last-minute holiday shopping, likely followed by a swift post-Christmas decline. The current demand regime is robustly high (~137 units for the last two weeks). To avoid stockouts in this critical final shopping week, I will maintain the aggressive recent_N forecast. Using N=4 captures the specific holiday surge (191, 128, 137, 137, avg ~148). Volatility estimates (sigma) will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the 128-191 range volatility. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak stable: P44-P45 demand perfectly consistent at 137 units, confirming a sustained high-volume plateau following the Black Friday spike (191).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to December 30th, the immediate post-Christmas week. Historically, retail demand often softens slightly after the gift-giving peak (Dec 25), though winter apparel remains relevant. The last few periods (P44-P46) showed a sustained high-volume plateau averaging 128.6 units (137, 137, 112). P46 demand dipped slightly to 112 from the 137 peak, suggesting the holiday frenzy is tapering off, but volume remains very high compared to the year start. Given the product is faux leather leggings, New Year's Eve parties might sustain demand in P47 before a potential January dip. The lead time remains reliably 0. I will prioritize the recent high-volume Holiday/Winter regime but acknowledge the slight dip in P46 by using a recent_N average that captures the current high plateau without overreacting to the single Black Friday spike (P42). A short history (N=4) captures the post-Black Friday holiday level (P43-P46 approx average 129 units).

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak tapering: Period 46 demand (112) dropped 18% from the sustained pre-Christmas high of 137 (P44-P45), signaling the start of post-holiday normalization while remaining in a high-volume winter regime.
