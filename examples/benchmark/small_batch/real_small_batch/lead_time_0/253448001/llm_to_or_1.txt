Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11): Entering Valentine's Day week, a significant seasonal peak for lingerie (bras). Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows an upward trend (51, 39, 58, 70, 62), averaging ~56 units. The most recent observations (70, 62) are higher than the January average, consistent with pre-Valentine's demand. Given the stockout risk (On-hand 0) and high service level target (0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the recent high demand to capture the seasonal momentum. L remains default (promised 0) as no delivery history exists yet. I will use a short history (N=3) for demand to focus on the recent feb/late-jan levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 demand (74) resulted in a stockout, confirming a sustained upward demand trend observed since late January. The average of the last 3 periods (Jan 28, Feb 4, Feb 11) is ~68.7 units, significantly higher than the average of the first 3 periods (~49.3). Lead time performed as promised (0 periods). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (0.8), I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to aggressively target the new, higher demand level and avoid further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: last 3 periods avg ~69 units, significantly higher than prior history avg ~50 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25). Lead time performance remains excellent with immediate arrivals (ordered P2, arrived P2). Demand continues to hold the higher plateau observed since late January. The last 4 demand points (70, 62, 74, 66) average 68 units, distinct from the early January average of ~50. To support the 80% service level target (based on profit 4/holding 1) and avoid stockouts in this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods. The on-hand inventory of 8 units allows us to top up precisely to the target base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 4 (Period 4). The product (Push-up Bra) likely experienced a seasonal demand spike for Valentine's Day (mid-Feb), evidenced by high demand in Periods 1-2 (74, 66) and pre-game Feb data. Period 3 demand dropped sharply to 40, signaling a likely return to baseline levels post-holiday. Because the profit margin ($4) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (~0.8), favoring high service levels. I am using recent_N=3 to calculate demand parameters. This allows the forecast to begin incorporating the downward trend (Period 3's 40) while maintaining a safety buffer derived from the recent holiday highs, preventing a stockout if the drop was merely noise. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand has dropped significantly in periods 3 (40) and 4 (43) compared to the February peak (avg 70 in P1-P2), likely signaling the end of the Valentine's demand surge. The current level ~41.5 aligns with pre-peak January history. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), I am using a mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to transition the forecast downward without undershoot risk (recent_3 avg ~50). Sigma includes the recent volatility (N=4). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Valentine's demand drop confirmed: P3-P4 avg 41.5 units, significantly down from P1-P2 avg 70 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (March 18) confirms the post-Valentine's demand regime is stable. Demand in periods 3, 4, and 5 (40, 43, 35) averages ~39.3 units, a clear stabilization significantly below the holiday peak seen in Periods 1-2. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am switching to 'recent_N' for both demand parameters with N=3 to strictly target this new post-holiday regime and exclude the high-variance, high-mean data from Feb 11-18. Including older data would artificially inflate safety stock and incur unnecessary holding costs given the $1 holding fee.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: March 25, 2019. We are deep in the post-Valentine's stabilization period. The demand trend continues to decline or stabilize at a lower baseline (Period 6 demand was 27 units, Period 5 was 35). This confirms the earlier insight about the demand drop. The rolling average of the last 4 periods (P3-P6: 40, 43, 35, 27) is approx 36.25 units, which is significantly lower than the February peak (avg ~70). Lead time remains reliably 0 (same-day arrival). Given the lower demand realization in Period 6 (27 units), I will switch to a tighter 'recent_N' moving average (N=4) for demand forecasting to reflect this lower regime without reacting too drastically to a single low point. Inventory is 16 units, which is lean, so a top-up is expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P5-P6 avg ~31 units, reinforcing the post-seasonal drop from Feb highs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 corresponds to April 1st. Demand has stabilized in the post-Valentine's period, averaging ~36.4 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) with moderate volatility, distinct from the February peak (~70 units). The most recent demand (P7) was 37, confirming this lower, stable spring regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 (immediate). Given low on-hand inventory (6 units), precise forecasting is key to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to base the forecast strictly on this stable post-holiday regime, excluding the irrelevant February data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 demand jumped to 55 units, causing a stockout and breaking the low post-seasonal trend (avg ~35 units in March). This aligns with pre-game January levels (avg ~50), suggesting the 'post-Valentine hangover' has ended and demand is returning to baseline. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we switch to an explicit forecast of 55 to instantly adapt to this regime shift rather than lagging with an average. Validating this against lead time stability (consistently 0) and using long-term volatility (default sigma) ensures a robust safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand spiked to 55 units, signaling end of post-seasonal slump and potential return to pre-holiday baseline (~50-60).

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (April 15). Demand in P9 moderated to 40 following the P8 spike (55), establishing a recent 3-period average of 44 units. This is a clear step up from the mid-March lows (avg ~30). Given the high Critical Ratio (0.8) and recent volatility (37-55 range), a responsive forecast is preferred to avoid stockouts if demand spikes again. We use 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu_hat to track the recent recovery level (~44) and 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the broader variance evident over the last month. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P7-P9 avg is ~44 units, distinctly higher than the mid-March trough (P5-P6 avg ~31), though high volatility persists.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (April 22). Demand in P9 and P10 stabilized perfectly at 40 units, indicating a steady state following the P8 spike (55 units). While the longer-term P6-P10 trend averages ~40 units, the cost of understocking (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) justifies a more aggressive forecast. I use a shorter N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~45 units) to weigh the recent P8 spike, protecting against volatility or pre-Mother's Day demand increases. Sigma uses N=5 to capture the variance across the recent stabilization and recovery phase (P6-P10). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late April (2019/4/29). Demand has shown remarkable stability over the last three periods (P9:40, P10:40, P11:41), averaging ~40.3 units. This indicates the volatility observed in early April (P8 spike to 55) has subsided, settling into a consistent spring baseline. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods with no missing shipments. To balance the current stability with protection against lingering volatility (like P8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters. This sets the forecast slightly above the immediate stable trend (avg ~42.6 vs ~40.3) and maintains a higher variance estimate to safeguard the 0.8 service level target.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P9-P11 demand is extremely consistent (40, 40, 41), establishing a new low-variance baseline ~40 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Previous period (P12) saw a demand spike to 55 units, breaking the recent low-volatility pattern of ~40 units observed in P9-P11. This mirrors the spike seen in P8 (also 55 units) at the start of the month. On-hand is 0, meaning we stocked out last period. The demand series for the last 5 periods is: [55, 40, 40, 41, 55]. Mean = 46.2. The recent consistency at 40 was broken, suggesting volatility is returning or there is an early-month/seasonal effect. Given the stockout and the spike, sticking to the very tight N=3 from P10/11 is risky. Widening the window to N=5 captures the peaks (55) and the stable baseline (40), providing a safer buffer (approx mean ~46, std devoted to covering the variance between 40 and 55). Lead time remains reliably 0. I will switch to N=5 for both mu and sigma to incorporate the recent higher variance and higher average.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility returned in P12 (spike to 55), breaking the stable ~40 unit trend of P9-P11 and matching the P8 spike.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted upward recently (P12=55, P13=50), averaging 52.5, which is notably higher than the stable April baseline of ~40. To avoid stockouts with only 3 units on hand, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this immediate trend. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=6) to account for the mix of stability and recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P12-P13 avg demand ~52.5 units, breaking April stability (avg ~40) and returning to expected baseline levels (~50-55).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 witnessed a massive demand shock of 113 units, more than double the prior baseline of ~50-55. This effectively drained all inventory and caused significant lost sales. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (0.8), the cost of underestimating demand is severe ($4 lost profit vs $1 holding). We switch to a highly reactive N=3 parameter set to capture this new high variance and elevated mean. While the spike may be an outlier, current parameters must protect against sustained high demand or further volatility to prevent repeated stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand shock detected in Period 14: 113 units, shattering the previous recovery trend (avg ~52.5) and introducing extreme volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 demand (80 units) remained elevated, confirming the Period 14 spike (113 units) was part of a high-volume event (likely mid-May seasonal like Mother's Day/Click Frenzy) rather than a data error. However, with the event period likely concluding, demand may revert toward the previous baseline (~50-55 units). To balance the risk of continued high demand against a potential post-event drop, I am using recent_N=5. This window blends the recent surge with the stable prior weeks, yielding a target mean (~68) that buffers against stockouts without fully committing to the peak levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-May demand surge confirmed: P14-P15 avg ~96.5 units, significantly above April baseline (~40-50), likely driven by seasonal sales events. Expect potential tapering in P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is early June. The extreme demand shock of mid-May (113 units) has subsided, with demand tapering sequentially (113 -> 80 -> 63). While P16 (63) is still above the April baseline, it indicates stabilization. Standard N=3 average (85 units) is now too aggressive given the downward trend. I am switching to N=5 (avg ~72) to balance the recent high volatility with the clear cooling pattern. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-May demand surge normalized: P16 demand (63) dropped significantly from P14-P15 highs (avg 96.5), suggesting a return to a moderately elevated baseline (~60-70) rather than sustained extreme growth.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand (42 units) confirms the end of the mid-May demand surge (P14-P16), returning levels to the April baseline (~40-50 units). The distinct downward trend (113->80->63->42) signals a stabilization of the market. We select mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this rapid deceleration (avg ~52.5) while maintaining a buffer slightly above the P17 low to hedge against 'high-normal' variance seen in P12-P13. Sigma_hat defaults to full history to ensure safety stock accounts for the recent extreme volatility without overriding the lower mean forecast. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge ended in P17: demand dropped to 42, confirming return to pre-surge baseline (~40-50 units) after 3 weeks of elevated activity.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (mid-June). Observed demand in P17 and P18 was identical at 42 units, confirming the mid-May surge has fully passed and demand has stabilized near the April baseline (~40-50). Lead times remain consistently 0. I adopt a defensive position: mu_hat uses N=3 (avg ~49) to anchor on the recent 42s while retaining a slight buffer from P16 (63). Sigma_hat uses N=5 to include the high-variance surge data (P14-P16), ensuring safety stock remains elevated enough to absorb potential shocks despite the lower mean forecast. This balances the $4 margin against the risk of recurring volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed: P18 demand matched P17 at 42 units, establishing a strong post-surge baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June). Demand has stabilized significantly over the last 3 periods (P17-P19: 42, 42, 46 units), averaging ~43.3. This confirms the mid-May surge is over and a new, lower baseline is established. On-hand is 29. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to tightly track this new stable mean (43.3). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=4 (includes P16's 63 units) to incorporate slightly more variance (~10 units std dev) than the very flat last 3 periods would suggest (~2 units), providing a necessary safety buffer against minor summer fluctuations while avoiding overstocking from the earlier massive surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed P17-P19 (avg ~43.3); mid-May surge volatility has fully dissipated.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st) logic: Demand has stabilized significantly after the mid-May volatility. The last 4 periods (P17-P20) show demand values of 42, 42, 46, and 52 respectively, averaging ~45.5 units. This indicates a return to the stable baseline observed in April (around 40-50 units). The most recent observation (52 units in P20) wiped out inventory, leading to a stockout risk if not replenished. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the stability, a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 captures this local regime accurately (avg ~45.5) without being skewed by the outlier 113 in mid-May. Pipeline is 0, on-hand is 0, so we need a robust order to cover demand immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed P17-P20: average ~45.5 units, slightly elevated from the April baseline (40) but well below May spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 22 (July 8, 2019). Reviewing recent performance: Demand in Period 21 was 65 units, depleting all inventory (Stockout). This follows a stable period of ~42-52 units (P17-P20). The recent jump to 65 suggests a potential mild summer uptake or just volatility, similar to the pre-spike baseline in early May. 

Lead Time Analysis: All completed periods (1-21) show actual lead time = 0. No evidence of delays or lost orders. We continue to trust L=0.

Demand Forecast:
- P17: 42
- P18: 42
- P19: 46
- P20: 52
- P21: 65 (Stockout occurred)

The trend is upward (42 -> 42 -> 46 -> 52 -> 65). The 5-period average is ~49.4. Using a short recent window (N=5) captures this rising trend better than a long average which is dragged down by the June lows. The volatility (sigma) should also be based on recent data to capture the shift from stable 40s to varied 50s/60s. 

Strategy: Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to react to the upward trend (avg ~49.4) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increasing variance (std deviation of P17-P21 is ~9.7). Service level target is high (80% critical ratio) so covering this variance is key to preventing further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend detected: P17-P21 shows steady growth (42->65), breaking the June stability (avg ~43). Summer seasonal demand likely engaging.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15. Demand has shifted into a higher summer regime over the last 3 periods (P20-P22: 52, 65, 55), averaging ~57.3 units, distinct from the June baseline (~45). P22 demand (55) suggests stabilization after the P21 spike (65). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, Critical Fractile 0.8), we select parameters to defend a high service level against this elevated summer demand. We define the current high-demand regime as starting in Period 20 (length 3).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization: P20-P22 avg ~57 units, establishing a higher tier vs June (~45). Volatility persists but P22 (55) indicates a potential ceiling after P21 (65).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22): Summer demand persists. While demand remains elevated compared to June (July avg ~56 vs June avg ~45), a sequential cooling trend has emerged over the last 3 weeks (65 -> 55 -> 48). I am using a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat (avg ~55) and sigma_hat to capture this elevated but softening summer baseline without overreacting to the single downward data point in P23. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand softening detected: sequential drop P21(65) -> P22(55) -> P23(48) suggests early July spike is normalizing, though levels remain above June baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 demand dropped sharply to 29 units, confirming a significant cooling trend from the early July peak (65). This 40% week-over-week decline (48->29) suggests we are entering a seasonal trough or 'summer slump'. However, with high margins (CR=0.8) and current inventory at 33, relying solely on the most recent observation (29) is risky if demand reverts to the monthly mean. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg ~44) to balance the downward trend with a safety buffer. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the full volatility of July (range 29-65). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump intensification confirmed: Period 24 demand plummeted to 29 units, a ~40% drop from prior week and ~55% off the July peak, confirming a transition to a lower demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/8/5. Period 25 demand recovered to 43 units after the sharp dip to 29 in Period 24, suggesting the 'slump' was partly noise and demand is stabilizing back to the June baseline levels (~40-45 units). The summer volatility (peak 65, low 29) appears to always revert to this mean. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (avg ~43.75) to capture this stabilized level while smoothing out the P24 dip. I am setting sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to explicitly include the recent high volatility (range 29-65) in the safety stock calculation, protecting against further erratic swings given the high critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility stabilizing: Period 25 recovery (43 units) after Period 24 dip (29) confirms a return to the June baseline (~43 units) rather than a continued seasonal decline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 experienced a massive demand shock (111 units), more than doubling the recent average (~43) and causing a stockout. This spike mirrors the May event (Period 14), suggesting an 'End of Summer' sales spike or clearance event. Given the product is lingerie and it is mid-August, high variance is expected. Lead times remain stable at 0. To address the stockout (current on-hand 0) and prepare for potential sustained high demand (similar to Period 15 post-shock), I am switching to a short-memory estimation (N=3). This captures the fierce volatility (29, 43, 111) and raises the base stock level significantly to ensure adequate service level (0.8) without overfitting to a single data point if it reverts immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand shock in Period 26: 111 units (vs prior avg ~43), mirroring May's volatility. Likely end-of-summer seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 corresponds to mid-August. We have observed two consecutive periods of extremely high demand (P26: 111, P27: 113), likely driven by 'End of Summer' or 'Back to School' clearance sales. This shift represents a roughly 2.5x increase over the prior baseline (~43 units). Previous conservative ordering resulted in stockouts and lost sales in both P26 and P27 (lost 55 and 15 sales respectively). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 margin) versus holding cost ($1), the optimal strategy is to chase demand aggressively until a downtrend is explicitly observed. We switch mu_hat to `recent_N=2` to align strictly with the new 110+ regime and ignore the lower historical average. We use `recent_N=3` for sigma to incorporate the volatility of the regime shift (the jump from 43 to 110) into the safety stock calculation, ensuring a buffer against further spikes or sustained high volume.

Carry-over insight: Summer clearance spike confirmed: P26-P27 avg ~112 units, causing stockouts. Demand regime ~2.5x higher than July baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late Aug): Demand has plateaued at ~111 units for 3 consecutive weeks (P26-P28), indicating a sustained 'End of Summer' sales event. While a drop-off is expected soon (Sept transition), the consistency of the signal (111, 113, 110) requires maintaining high stock levels to prevent lost sales during the tail end of this event. Switching to recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma correctly targets this elevated regime (~111 avg) rather than diluted historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge (P26-P28) confirmed as a sustained plateau (~111 units), significantly higher than May/July peaks. Likely 'Back to School' or 'End of Summer' clearance effect.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 demand (68 units) confirms the end of the August seasonal surge (P26-P28 avg ~111), dropping 38% week-over-week. This pattern mirrors the rapid normalization seen after the May surge (P16-P17). Expect demand to continue tampering towards the pre-surge baseline of ~45-55 units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 58 (splitting the difference between P29's shoulder and the expected baseline) to avoid overstocking while holding high safety stock via recent volatility (sigma N=4) to protect against a slower-than-expected decline.

Carry-over insight: August peak ended in Period 29: Demand dropped to 68 (-38% from peak avg 111), signaling return to baseline trends (~45-55 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) marks the continued normalization following the late-August demand peak. Demand has progressively cooled from the ~111 unit high (P26-P28) to 68 (P29) and now 62 (P30). This suggests a settling trend around ~65 units, which remains elevated compared to the spring baseline (~40-45 units) but is clearly off the seasonal peak. To prevent overstocking based on the outlier August data, we switch mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=2, targeting the immediate normalization trend (~65 units). We retain 'default' for sigma_hat to utilize the broader historical volatility as a safety buffer, ensuring we don't stock out if demand fluctuates or settles slightly higher than expected during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-August peak stabilization confirmed: Demand settling ~65 units (P29-P30 avg), still elevated above spring baseline (~40s) but well below peak (~110).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Sep 16) follows a sharp demand drop in Period 31 to 35 units, significantly below the prior two weeks' average of ~65 units. This suggests the high-demand summer/back-to-school season has concluded, and we are entering a lower-volume fall season comparable to the sluggish trends seen in March (avg ~31). However, given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), reacting solely to the single data point of 35 is risky if it proves to be a one-off dip. We select mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 (avg ~55) to blend the recent stability with the new low, effectively ramping down the forecast conservatively. We maintain a broader view for volatility using 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat, ensuring the variance calculation still captures the tail risk of the August peaks to maintain an adequate safety stock buffer during this transition.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal slump detected: Period 31 demand (35 units) dropped ~46% from the prior 2-week average (65), signaling a return to the lower baseline (~30-40 units) seen in Spring.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Late September). Demand has continued its sharp decline, dropping to 26 units in Period 32, which is the lowest level observed since March (Period 6). This confirms a deepening 'September Slump' following the August peak. The current trend (62 -> 35 -> 26) suggests a shift to a low-volume regime (~25-40 units) typical of the pre-holiday lull. Current on-hand inventory (58 units) is robust given actionable demand is likely below 40. We select 'recent_N' = 3 for forecasting to capture the rapid deceleration while retaining the early-September data point (62) as a safety buffer against a potential rebound. Volatility is high during this transition, so N=3 for sigma is also appropriate. Observed lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: September slump deepening confirmed: Period 32 demand (26 units) marks the lowest point since March, validating a transition to a low-volume seasonal trough (~30 units) following the August peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand bounced back to 41 units, significantly recovering from the Period 32 low of 26 units. This suggests the 'September slump' was short-lived or has found a floor, likely returning to the long-established operational baseline of ~40-45 units (seen in April/June). Current on-hand inventory (17 units) is well below even this conservative baseline, risking immediate stockouts in the P34 arrival phase. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), it is safer to over-forecast slightly than under-serve. Therefore, I am using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mean and volatility. This window bridges the recent lows (26, 35) with the tail of the August plateau (62, 68), resulting in a target that ensures service availability without reacting too drastically to the single data point of 26.

Carry-over insight: September slump stabilization: Period 33 demand recovered to 41 units (from P32 low of 26), suggesting the seasonal trough was brief and demand is reverting to the long-term stable baseline (~40-45 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (early October). The 'September Slump' (Period 32 low of 26 units) appears to have fully resolved. Demand in the last two periods (P33: 41, P34: 38) averages ~39.5 units, strongly aligning with the long-term stable baseline of ~40 units observed frequently in Spring (e.g., Periods 9-11, April/June). Given the date (early October) and lack of immediate holidays, I expect this stable baseline to persist before pre-holiday ramp-ups in November. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to target this ~40 unit level closely, ignoring the outlier dip in Period 32. For sigma, I use N=5 to retain some memory of the recent descent from August highs while acknowledging current stability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability re-established: P33-P34 avg ~39.5 units, confirming recovery from September low (26) back to the long-term recurrent baseline of ~40 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Oct 14, 2019. Demand remains in a low-volume post-summer regime. Since Period 31 (post-Labor Day), demand has averaged ~33.8 units (Range: 26-41), significantly below the summer peak and August clearance levels. Period 35 demand (29 units) dipped again, challenging the stability seen in P33-P34 and suggesting a baseline closer to 30 than 40. Given this continued lull and lack of immediate seasonal catalysts before November, I am using 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to strictly align inventory with the current depressed demand levels (P31-P35) and avoid overstocking derived from older high-volume history. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: October demand softens: Period 35 demand (29) broke the brief recovery trend (P33-P34 avg ~39.5), confirming the current regime is a volatile low-volume trough fluctuating between 25-40 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Oct 21. Demand has stabilized into a low-volume autumn trough (avg ~37 units over last 4 periods). Stockout in P36 requires immediate replenishment. Using recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to reflect this lower, more stable regime (post-September slump, pre-Holiday) and ignore the irrelevant August spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P33-P36 average demand is ~37 units, consolidating the recovery from the September slump (low 26) into a steady low-volume autumn baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (Oct 28) marks the end of October, historically a low-volume month for this SKU. Recent demand (P33-P37) has been stable around an average of ~36.8 units (samples: 41, 38, 29, 40, 36), which consolidates the post-September slump recovery into a reliable autumn baseline. The volatility is relatively low compared to summer peaks. There's no immediate seasonal catalyst in early November, though the Holiday season (Black Friday / Christmas) looms in late November/December. For now, the best strategy is to adhere to the recent stable regime (last 5 periods) to avoid overstocking during this low season while maintaining coverage for minor fluctuations. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is November 4. Demand for Period 38 (34 units) aligns with the stable, low-volume pattern observed since late September (Period 33-38 average ~36 units). The erratic variance from August has dissipated, leaving a consistent autumn baseline. Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods. To optimize for the current stable regime while minimizing holding costs before the holiday season potentially starts, we utilize a recent_N=6 window for both mean and volatility, excluding the older high-variance summer data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 is November 11th (11/11), widely known as Singles' Day, a major global retail shopping event. Given the product category (Lingerie), a significant demand spike is highly probable this week, similar to the surges seen in May (Mother's Day/Spring sales) and August (Back to School/Clearance). Current baseline demand has been low and stable (avg ~32 units over P37-P39). However, relying on this low baseline would lead to a stockout during a promotional event. I will manually override the forecast to anticipate a spike. Looking at previous major spikes (P14=113, P26-28~111), a surge to ~100+ is possible. To be safe but not overreact given the smaller scale of recent volatility, I will target a forecast closer to the previous seasonal highs. I will set mu_hat explicitly to covering a potential spike of ~90-100 units. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed: P36-P39 avg ~35 units, solidifying the low-volume autumn baseline before expected holiday seasonality.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18) precedes the Black Friday retail week (Period 42). Current demand remains in a low-volume autumn trough (average ~34 units over last 5 periods, trending slightly downward), with no observed spike on Period 40 (Nov 11/Singles' Day). We enter Period 41 with high excess inventory (107 units) due to a large aggressive order in Period 40. Given the reliable 0-period lead time, we can reactively order for Black Friday in Period 42 if needed. For now, the priority is to halt ordering and burn down excess stock to reduce holding costs ($1/unit). We utilize recent history (N=5) to reflect the depressed baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) covers Black Friday (Nov 29), a massive retail event. Period 41 demand (45 units) showed a +55% jump from the Period 40 low (29), signaling the start of the holiday ramp-up. Historical peaks in mid-May and late-August reached ~110-113 units. Given the high cost of stocking out (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and the strong seasonal signal, I am setting parameters aggressively to match previous peak magnitudes, anticipating demand around 100 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season onset confirmed: Period 41 demand (45) rose +55% from Period 40 low (29). Approaching Black Friday (Period 42), expect demand to challenge historical peaks (~110 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins on Dec 2, 2019, which corresponds to Cyber Monday, a major online retail event. Given the observed sharp upward trend (P40:29 -> P41:45 -> P42:58) and the holiday season context, demand is expected to peak further, potentially exceeding the Black Friday week levels. An explicit forecast of 72 units (approx +25% over P42) is set to ensure availability for this critical sales week, with sigma increased to 25 to capture holiday volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday ramp-up confirmed: Period 42 demand hit 58 units (+29% vs P41), validating the seasonal ascent initiated in mid-November. Expect sustained high volumes through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date (Dec 9) places us in the pre-Christmas window, approaching the historically high-demand January season (Jan 2019 samples avg ~56 units). Period 43 demand dropped unexpectedly to 20 units (-66% vs P42), likely a post-Black Friday lull. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4:$1) and the imminent seasonal peak, relying on the recent low average (influenced by P43) is risky. We switch to an explicit forecast of 55 units to align with the expected January baseline and ensure service integrity through the holiday period. Volatility is captured using recent history (N=5) to reflect the swing from 58 to 20.

Carry-over insight: Period 43 demand drop verified: fell to 20 units (-65% vs P42), signaling a sharp post-Black Friday lull. However, historical January data (avg ~56) indicates this is temporary and high seasonal demand should resume shortly.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 corresponds to the week of December 16, the peak shopping week before Christmas. Demand in Period 44 recovered to 45 units, bouncing back from the localized dip in Period 43 (20 units) and realigning with the strong start of the season in Period 42 (58 units). With current on-hand inventory at a critically low 29 units, a stockout is imminent without a significant order. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit-to-holding ratio) and the category (giftable lingerie), I am using explicit parameters to target a base stock sufficient for peak holiday demand (forecasted ~65 units) and high volatility (sigma ~25).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Christmas demand recovery confirmed: Period 44 demand (45 units) rebounded from the Period 43 lull (20), signaling a return to seasonal intensity. High volatility (range 20-58) necessitates elevated safety stock for the final holiday shopping week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) represents the final push of holiday sales. P45 demand hit 65 units, recovering fully from the early Dec lull. Current inventory (22) is critical and likely insufficient for P46 demand. We use recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to average the volatile holiday period (avg ~47, high variance), ensuring we replenish stock for the final sales week without over-committing to peak levels as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 65 units, completing the specific pre-Christmas ramp-up (P43 low of 20 -> P45 peak 65). Expect immediate transition to post-holiday clear-out or slump in P47.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (Dec 30) marks the immediate post-Christmas week. Historical data and general retail patterns suggest a significant drop in primary demand as gift-giving ends, though clearance/sales activity may keep volume moderately elevated compared to the yearly trough. Period 46 ended with a stockout (0 units on hand), meaning we enter P47 with 0 inventory + any arrivals. The demand in P46 was robust (71 units), confirming the holiday peak. However, P47 typically sees a sharp reversion. I will pivot to a 'recent_N' strategy with a small N to capture the high recent volatility (P45: 65, P46: 71) but temper the forecast slightly as we exit the peak. 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the holiday intensity (avg ~60) which acts as a safe buffer against residual New Year's sales demand, rather than reverting instantly to the low autumn baseline (~35).  Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak effectively concluded in Period 46 with demand of 71 units, causing a stockout. We are now entering the post-holiday clearance/slump phase (Period 47+), where demand is expected to moderate significantly from the Dec highs.
