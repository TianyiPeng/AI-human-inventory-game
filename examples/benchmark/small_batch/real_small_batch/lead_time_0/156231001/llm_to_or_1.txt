Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start (Feb 11). Product (Tights) is in-season (winter). Historical data from the last 5 weeks indicates an average demand of ~180 units with a recent upward trend (last observation 215). Utilizing all available history (N=5) for demand parameters to establish a stable baseline. Lead time is set to default (promised 0) as there are no observations yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 Decision (2019-02-18):

1. **Demand Context**: The product is 'Box 4p Tights', a staple clothing item. The date is late February, still within the winter season where tights are commonly worn. Historical data shows demand is relatively high (around 200 units).

2. **Recent Demand**: Last period (Period 1) demand was 203. Historical samples provided prior to Period 1 were [186, 151, 151, 198, 215]. The average of these 5 samples plus the new observation (203) suggests a mean around 184. The most recent observations (198, 215, 203) are higher than earlier January data, potentially indicating a slight seasonal peak or stable high demand.

3. **Lead Time**: Promised lead time is 0. In Period 1, the order of 205 units arrived immediately (lead_time=0), confirming the promised lead time holds true for now. We will continue to use 'default' (promised) lead time.

4. **Inventory Status**: Starting on-hand is 2 units. We need to cover demand for Period 2 plus safety stock. Since lead time is 0, we only need to cover the current review period (L+1 = 1 period).

5. **Parameter Selection**:
   - **L**: 'default' (0 periods).
   - **mu_hat**: We will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (approx samples: 215, 198, 203) to capture the recent higher demand level rather than dragging it down with the mid-January dip. Average is approx 205.
   - **sigma_hat**: We will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture recent volatility without overreacting to a single point. Volatility seems moderate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). A significant demand spike occurred in Period 2 (313 units), leading to a stockout caused by demand exceeding available inventory. This continues a rising trend observed since late January (Feb avg ~244 vs Jan avg ~160). Lead time remains reliably 0. To recover inventory and prepare for potentially sustained higher demand levels, we switch to 'recent_N' (N=3) for both mean and volatility estimation. This incorporates the high P2 demand into the forecast while discarding lower January data, increasing the base stock level to prevent future stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime upward shift confirmed: Feb avg ~244 vs Jan avg ~163 (+50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1180.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (March 4) context: Demand for tights (156231001) has exhibited a sharp, sustained increase in late Feb, stabilizing around 310 units/period (P2=313, P3=309). This is significantly higher than the early Feb average (~200) or Jan average (~160). As profit is high relative to holding cost (4:1), avoiding stockouts is critical. I am switching mu_hat to `recent_N=2` to aggressively track this new high plateau (~311) rather than dragging it down with older data. I am setting sigma_hat to `recent_N=5` to capture the standard deviation of the recent ascent, ensuring adequate safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0, so default is used.

Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Monitor: Period 5 (March 11). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival confirmed in all history). Demand Analysis: While demand peaked in late Feb (~310), Period 4 dropped to 235, suggesting the extreme peak may be subsiding or stabilizing. However, 235 is still significantly above the Jan pre-game average (~170). Decision: I will use 'recent_N=4' (covering the entire active game history) for both mean and volatility. This sets the forecast around ~265 (blending the high peaks and recent moderate drop) and captures the high variance (std dev ~53) to maintain adequate safety stock for the high-margin item (80% service level target).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/3/18 (Period 6). SKU 156231001 (Tights). We observed a demand spike in Feb (Periods 2-3: 313, 309), but March demands (Periods 4-5) have dropped significantly to 235 and 170. The 5-week average is now ~246, but the most recent 2-week average is ~202.5. The recent dip suggests the Feb spike might have been temporary or seasonal ending. Given the high volatility (range 170-313), sticking to a recent_N approach for demand estimation is prudent to capture the downward trend without overreacting to a single point. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival confirmed in all P1-P5). We will use L=0 (default). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, recent_N=3 is chosen to capture the transition from the high Feb demand to the lower March demand (incorporating periods 3, 4, 5: 309, 235, 170).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward in March: Aug avg ~203 (P4-P5) vs Feb peak ~311 (P2-P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 is late March (3/25). Demand history shows a clear downward trend since the February peak: Feb (203, 313, 309) -> March (235, 170, 237). The average of the last 3 periods (March) is ~214, significantly lower than the Feb peak avg of ~275. Last period (P6) had demand 237, which is a slight uptick from P5 (170) but still well below peak. Given the likely seasonal transition to spring, demand for tights may stabilize or decrease slightly. We have 0 in-transit and lead time has consistently been 0. We will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak lowering trend (avg ~214 vs Feb highs) without overreacting to the single dip in P5. We maintain L=0 (default) as delivery is reliably same-period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 corresponds to April 1st; we are observing the continuation of the post-winter demand stabilization. The March average (Periods 4-7) is approximately 221 units, confirming the drop from the February peak (~311 units). Periods 6 and 7 have stabilized around 240 units, recovering from the dip in Period 5 (170 units). We select 'recent_N=4' for both demand and volatility to capture this March regime (mixing the stabilization with the observed volatility). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 demand (351) spiked significantly (+45%) above the stable March average (~240), causing a stockout. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) and zero on-hand inventory, strict service level protection is required. We shift to a short-memory forecast (recent_N=3) for both mean and volatility to capture this potential upward shift and increased variance (Sample Mean=277, StdDev~64), raising the base stock target while we verify if this is a sustained regime or a one-off outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April). Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods. Demand has shifted upward again in April (Periods 8-9 avg ~319) after a lull in March (avg ~221). To capture this resurgence while balancing the volatility (P8=351, P9=286), we switch to a short-term recent_N=3 forecast. This discards the lower mid-March data and focuses on the rising trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed in April: P8-P9 avg ~319 vs March avg ~221 (+44%).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/4/22 (Post-Easter). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods. April demand has shown high volatility and a sharp downward trend over the last 3 periods (351 -> 286 -> 214), reverting close to March levels. Despite the drop, the high cost ratio (q=0.8) requires protection against potential spikes seen earlier in the month. I am switching to 'recent_N=3' for both mu and sigma to capture this specific April volatility profile (Avg ~284, high std dev) rather than relying on the lower global average or the misleadingly high peak of early April alone.

Carry-over insight: April demand downward trend: consistently decreasing volume from P8 (351) to P10 (214).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (April 29) marks the transition into May/Spring. Observed demand has declined consistently for 4 consecutive weeks (351 -> 286 -> 214 -> 181), aligning with expected seasonal warmth reducing tights usage. The current level (181) has returned to pre-peak January levels. Given the steep negative slope, using a long average would dangerously overstock. I select 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat (avg ~197.5) to closely track the downward trend while maintaining a slight buffer against stockouts (Inventory 161 < Forecast 197). Sigma uses N=3 to account for the volatility of the recent drop. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal ramp-down confirmed: Demand sustained 4-week decline (351 -> 181) returning to Jan baseline as May approaches.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6) marks late spring, reinforcing the seasonal ramp-down for tights. Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline (avg ~201 over last 3 periods) compared to the April peak (351). Although P12 (209) was slightly higher than P11 (181), the overall level is consistent with the pre-winter baseline observed in Jan/Feb. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower volume (~201 units) while excluding the high demand from P9 (286) which would inflate coverage. Sigma is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current variance rather than historical volatility. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Last 3 periods avg ~201, halting the steep decline observed in April.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (mid-May). Demand for tights has stabilized at a lower seasonal baseline consistent with warmer weather. Over the last 4 periods (P10-P13), demand averaged 197.25 units with moderate volatility (range 181-214). This confirms the stabilization trend noted in Period 13 and suggests the high-demand volatility of March/April has passed. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for both demand parameters to align the inventory policy with this current stabilized regime (approx 200 units), preventing overstocking while covering the observed local variance.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) context: Demand for tights has stabilized over the last 5 weeks (avg ~199 units), fluctuating narrowly between 181 and 214 units. This indicates the steep post-season decline observed in April has platooned into a steady off-peak baseline for May. Promised lead time (0 periods) remains reliable with all orders arriving the same period. Given the stable recent history and lack of further downward trend, I am using a rolling average of the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) for both mean and volatility to maintain sufficient stock (~200 units) without over-committing as summer approaches.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 represents late May. Demand in May (Periods 12-15) has stabilized into a consistent range (avg ~206 units), halting the steep decline seen in April. P15 saw a slight uptick to 227 units, causing a stockout as inventory was depleted (ending=0), but the overall volatility remains low compared to the start of the year. Given the product (Tights) and the approach of summer (June), we anticipate demand to remain flat or soften. We select N=4 for mu and sigma to tightly track this recent consolidated May regime, avoiding the high-variance data from April. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $563.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to June 3rd, marking the transition to summer. Demand for tights typically declines in warmer months. Observation effectively confirms this: Period 16 demand dropped to 157, which closely matches the January 'pre-season' baseline (~163). The average demand over the last 4 periods (May) is ~194, showing significant volatility (high of 227 in P15, low of 157 in P16). We use 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mean and volatility to balance the service level risk (cost of stockout is 4x holding cost) against the downward seasonal trend. This captures the recent 'noisy' decline without overreacting to the single low data point of 157 immediately.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline established: Period 16 demand (157) has returned to pre-season January levels (~163), confirming end of Spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 corresponds to mid-June, confirming the deep summer seasonality for tights (SKU 156231001). Period 17 demand dropped sharply to 99 units, significantly below the previous 'January baseline' of ~160. This creates a steep downward trend (227 -> 157 -> 99). We select 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this rapid decline while retaining high variance to protect service levels (Critical Ratio 0.8). A short memory is crucial here to avoid overstocking as we enter the lowest demand season.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer seasonality confirmed: Period 17 demand (99) broke significantly below pre-season January baseline (~160), establishing a new low-volume summer regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (mid-June) confirms the low-volume summer season for '20 denier tights'. Demand has dropped from Spring peaks (>200) to a recent range of 99-127. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat anchors the forecast to this new seasonal low (~128 units) while reacting quickly to the reduced volatility of the summer regime. This protects against overstocking while maintaining service for the remaining baseline demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer regime stabilization: June demands (P17-P18) avg ~113, confirming a sustained drop to ~55% of the Jan baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $262.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (Late June). Demand has settled into a low-volume summer regime typical for this product category (20 denier tights). The last 3 periods (P17-P19) show consistently low demand {99, 127, 83} with an average of ~103 units, which is significantly below the Spring peak (~300+). The most recent observation (83) suggests demand may still be softening or fluctuating at this new bottom. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to tightly follow this new summer baseline and exclude the higher transition value from Period 16 (157). This minimizes holding risk (Cost=$1 vs Profit=$4) during the low season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 represents July 1st, deep summer. Demand for tights has collapsed as expected for the season, hitting a historic low of 41 units in Period 20 (trend: 127 -> 83 -> 41). The current on-hand inventory of 81 units is likely sufficient for coverage if demand stays near 41, but we must update the forecast to reflect this new low-volume regime. We switch to a tight recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma to rapidly adapt to the summer trough (average ~84) while not overfitting to a single data point. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough intensification: Demand hit historic low of 41 in late June (P20), driving 3-week average down to ~84 (approx 25% of peak season volume).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Deep summer seasonality dominates. Demand for tights is extremely low (last 3 periods avg ~59). We use a very short N=3 horizon for both mean and volatility to align supply with this specific summer trough, avoiding overstocking as we sit on ~1 period of inventory already.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed: July demand holding steady at historical lows (~40-60 units), approximately ~20-25% of peak season volume.

It is mid-July (Period 23), generally the lowest demand season for tights. Demand has stabilized in a deep trough, averaging ~57 units over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), with recent weeks holding steady near ~53. Lead times remain reliably 0 periods. We select 'recent_N' with N=4 for both demand and volatility to accurately track this low-volume summer baseline without over-weighting the slightly higher sales from early June. This maintains a lean inventory while covering the minor fluctuations seen in the trough.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22 (Period 24). We are in the deep summer season, and demand for 20 denier tights remains at the historical trough, reflecting seasonal unsuitability. Observations P20-P23 show a stable low-volume regime (41, 53, 53, 30), averaging ~44 units, which is a fraction of the winter peak (>300). The most recent period (P23) hit a new absolute low of 30. To minimize holding costs while maintaining basic availability for this residual demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mean and volatility. This focuses the forecast strictly on the current summer trough levels (approx 44 units) rather than older spring/winter data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough depth confirmed: Mid-July demand hit new low of 30 (P23), pulling 4-week avg to ~44.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29): We are in the deepest part of the summer trough for Tights/Hosiery. Demand in Period 24 dropped to an all-time low of 9 units, following a steady decline through July (53 -> 53 -> 30 -> 9). This extremely low volume (~5% of peak feb/march volume) confirms the summer seasonality is fully active. The 4-week average (P21-P24) is ~36.25, and the most recent 2-week average is just 19.5, indicating demand is virtually non-existent during the hottest weeks of the year. Given the high volatility relative to the low mean (CV is high), and the critical need to avoid holding cost accumulation during this dormant period, I will use a very short recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the crash to single digits quickly. Lead time remains stable at 0. Service level is high (z=1.28) but the base stock calculation needs to react to the almost zero demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough hit absolute floor: Period 24 demand (9 units) is <5% of winter peak, confirming July/August as dormant periods for this SKU.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/8/5. We remain in the deep summer trough for Tights (20 denier), with demand hitting an absolute seasonal floor (recent periods: 9, 19 units). Winter peak demand was ~300+, so relying on long-term history would cause massive overstocking. We continue to use a short memory (recent_N=5) to align inventory targets with the current dormant demand regime (avg ~33 units over last 5 weeks). This maintains a lean inventory while providing coverage for minor fluctuations (e.g., back to ~50 units) without accumulating dead stock before the Autumn ramp-up.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is mid-August (Week 33). We just witnessed a significant spike in demand in Period 26 (84 units) compared to the deep summer trough of July (avg ~32 units). This spike (from 19 units in P25 to 84 in P26) suggests the 'Back to School' or early Autumn transition has begun for hosiery/tights. Relying on the summer average (approx 40-50) would cause stockouts as demand ramps up towards the autumn peak. I will switch from a short-memory N=3 (which captured the trough) to a slightly more responsive recent_N=3 but acknowledge the upward shift by allowing the mean to reflect this sudden jump. The sudden jump to 84 is a strong signal of season change. Lead time is consistently 0 (same-day arrival).

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up detected: Period 26 demand spiked to 84 (vs July avg ~32), signaling the end of the summer dormant period and start of Back-to-School/Autumn season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Autumn Season confirmed: Demand surged to 197 in P27 (vs summer low of 9) causing consecutive stockouts. Naive averages drag forecast down due to summer trough history. Using explicit mu_hat=220 to match recovered baseline and rebuild stock rapidly. Sigma set to recent_N=3 to capture expansion volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter season confirmed: Demand fully recovered to ~200 baseline (P27 demand 197 vs summer lows <50).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Exit from summer trough confirmed. Demand has jumped from July avg ~32 to Aug avg ~143 (last 3 periods). Old summer data is now misleading. Switching to short N=3 memory to capture the rapid autumn ramp-up (Back-to-School/Seasonal change). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery stabilized: Late August demand (P27-P28) averaged ~173, confirming the transition out of summer dormancy is complete and volume is approaching Winter norms (~200+).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 2 (Period 30). The product (20 denier tights) is entering its peak Autumn/Winter season. We observed a clear seasonal inflection point starting in Period 26. While recent demand (Periods 28-29: 149, 114) shows some volatility, the average is significantly higher than the summer trough. The drop in Period 29 (114) might be noise or a brief lull before colder weather sets in. Given the strong signal in Period 27 (197) and the historical context of Autumn demand ramping up to ~200-250+ (observed in Feb/Mar history), we must prioritize preventing stockouts. The current on-hand of 78 is likely insufficient for the ramping demand. I will use a short-window Moving Average (N=4) to capture the rapid upward trend from the seasonal turn (Periods 26-29) while filtering out the extreme volatility of single periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up volatility: Early season demand shows high variance (84 -> 197 -> 149 -> 114), avg ~136, necessitating responsive parameters to catch the upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (243) spiked significantly, causing a stockout and confirming a return to high-volume 'Winter' levels comparable to Feb (avg ~270). The recent demand pattern is highly volatile (114 -> 243), likely driven by weather fluctuations typical of early Autumn. Simple averages (recent_N) are currently lagging the upward trend (5-period avg ~157 vs P30 243), risking further stockouts in a high-margin scenario (Critical Ratio 0.8). I am switching to explicit parameters to aggressively capture the new ceiling established by P30 (`mu_hat`=225, bridging the P27 and P30 peaks) and increasing volatility estimates (`sigma_hat`=70) to ensure sufficient safety stock against the observed rapid fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Autumn volatility confirmed with a sharp rebound to 243 units (vs P29 114), re-establishing potential for Winter-level peaks (>240 units) observed in Feb.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1086.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-September (Period 32), firmly in the autumn ramp-up season for tights. Demand has confirmed a strong upward trajectory, recovering from summer lows (~30 units) to typical winter levels. Period 31 demand was 274, confirming the high volume signal seen in Period 30 (243, constrained). The last 3 periods (P29-P31: 114, 243, 274) show volatility but a clear upward shift to a new regime averaging ~210 units, though the most recent two are significantly higher (~258 avg). Given this rapid escalation back to peak levels (Jan/Feb had peaks ~300+), we must switch to a highly responsive forecast. A short history (recent_N=3) captures the current active ramp-up without being dragged down by August's lower numbers. The lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed: Early Sept demand (avg ~258 for P30-P31) has fully returned to Winter levels (>240), signaling the complete end of the transition phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Sept 23): We are now firmly in the Autumn season. The last 3 periods (P30-P32) have shown robust demand averaging ~257 units (243, 274, 255), which aligns with the Winter baseline observed in February (avg ~244). The summer trough is completely over. The product description (20 denier tights) suggests high relevance for cooling weather. Recent demand volatility (P29 low of 114 vs P31 high of 274) requires a responsive forecast to prevent stockouts like in P30. I will switch to a short-term moving average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture this established higher plateau (avg ~257) rather than dragging along the lower August data. Sigma needs to account for the P29-P31 fluctuations, so I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the variance during this ramp-up. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn-Winter baseline re-established: Demand has stabilized above 250 units (3-period avg ~257), effectively matching February peak levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1276.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand spiked to 496 units, the highest recorded volume in history (exceeding the previous Feb peak of 313 by ~58%). This drastic surge confirms that the Autumn/Winter season for tights has not only started but intensified rapidly as we enter October (socks & tights prime season). Recent demand (last 3 periods: 274, 255, 496) averages ~342 with high volatility (std dev ~134). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 margin vs $1 holding), we shift to a responsive N=3 forecast to capture this new high-volume regime and the associated volatility, preventing stockouts during this critical seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Seasonal intensity surge confirmed: Demand hit a historic high of 496 units (vs previous 3-week avg ~257), confirming the transition from early Autumn ramp-up to full High-Winter volume regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1335.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 corresponds to early October, a prime season for tights. Following the massive spike in Period 33 (496 units), Period 34 demand remained high at 358 units, confirming a sustained shift to a High-Winter volume regime significantly above the September baseline of ~250 units. While demand pulled back from the P33 peak, the 358 figure indicates the 496 was not purely an anomaly but part of a volatile seasonal surge. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume, high-volatility regime (avg ~370) without over-weighting the single extreme peak of P33. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-Winter regime sustained: Period 34 demand (358) confirms volume remains significantly above September baseline (~250), despite pullback from P33 peak (496), establishing a new volatile norm of 350+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1283.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (mid-October) reinforces the High-Winter demand regime for Tights. Demand in P35 was 351, which aligns with the volatile high-volume trend observed since late September (P33: 496, P34: 358). The three-week average (P33-P35) is approx 401, significantly higher than the early September baseline (~258). With on-hand inventory at 121 and zero in-transit, there is a risk of stockout given the volatility (std dev high). I will switch to `recent_N` with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate high-intensity regime (Avg ~401, Std ~78) rather than diluting it with lower September data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-Winter regime stabilized: October demand (P34-P35) consistently holding above 350 units (avg ~354), validating the shift to peak season parameters.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21) places us firmly in the High-Winter demand regime for tights. Recent demand (P34-P36) has averaged ~349 units, consistently well above the Summer and Autumn baselines. The peak in P33 (496) and sustained high volume afterward confirm that we must aggressively stock to prevent stockouts during this critical season. With lead time consistently 0, we can respond quickly, but volatility is high. I will use a short recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-volume plateau (~349 median) without dragging in lower September values. For sigma, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current tightness and volatility. No new carry-over insights are needed as the High-Winter regime is already well-documented.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (late October) confirms the high-intensity Winter regime is fully active. Demand in Period 37 spiked to 447 units, depleting all inventory, following a consistent October trend of high volumes (358, 351, 337, 447). The 4-week average is now ~373 units, with significant volatility (std dev >50). This SKU is clearly in its peak season (autumn/winter tights), requiring aggressive inventory policies to prevent stockouts like the one observed in P37. We will set mu_hat based on the recent high-volume regime (last 4 periods) to capture the elevated baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival).

Carry-over insight: High-Winter volatility spike confirmed: Period 37 demand (447) significantly exceeded the stable Oct baseline (~350), indicating peak season unpredictability and upside risk.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) marks the consolidation of the High-Winter season. Demand history shows a volatile high-volume regime: P33(496), P34(358), P35(351), P36(337), P37(447), P38(309). The average over these last 6 periods is ~383 units, with significant variance (std dev ~70). The recent drop to 309 in P38 looks like typical noise within a high-volume trend rather than a structural decline, especially given the calendar date (approaching Black Friday/holidays). I will use a reactive 'recent_N' approach (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-volatility winter plateau. This sets a target base stock well above 400 to mitigate stockouts seen in P37, maximizing the high critical ratio (0.8). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-Winter plateau confirmed: Last 6 periods (P33-P38) average ~383 units with peaks nearing 500, sustaining the high-volume regime established in late September.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is deep within the High-Winter season for tights. Demand in the last 7 periods (P33-P39) has averaged ~374 units, with peaks reaching 496 and 447. While the most recent two periods (309, 322) show a localized pullback, the high volatility and critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Cost 1) mandate a defensive posture. I am selecting recent_N=7 for both mean and volatility to capitalize on the full high-season data window, ensuring the base stock level (target) accounts for the recurring spikes >450 seen since late September. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 18, well into the prime Autumn/Winter season for tights. While the last 3 periods (P38-P40) show a demand softening (avg ~300) compared to the October highs (P33-P37 avg ~397), the heavy seasonality and proximity to holiday sales events suggest demand could spike again. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), it is safer to maintain a robust inventory position. We select N=8 for both mu and sigma to capture the full 'High-Winter' distribution, blending the recent dip with the earlier peaks (496 observed in P33) to ensure adequate safety stock against high volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-Winter pullback detected: Recent 3-period average ~300 (P38-P40) measures ~25% lower than the intense October peak average (~397), confirming high intra-seasonal volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (late Nov) update: Demand is in the High-Winter regime but showing volatility. Recent demand sequence (P37-P41: 447, 309, 322, 271, 285) averages ~327, notably lower than the October peak average of ~397. This pullback suggests a stabilization or temporary lull before the December holiday rush. Given the product (20 denier tights) is highly seasonal for winter, I expect demand to remain high or surge again in December. However, applying the pure recent average (~327) is safer than the October peak to avoid overstocking if the lull persists, while the high variance suggests maintaining a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' estimator with N=5 (post-October peak) to capture this stabilized high-volume level while staying responsive to the upcoming holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: High-Winter stabilization: November demand (P38-P41) averaged ~297, settling ~25% below the October peak (~397), establishing a new stable plateau before expected December holiday spikes.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 corresponds to Dec 2nd, marking the start of the peak winter/holiday shopping month. Period 42 showed a massive demand spike to 461 units (stockout occurred), significantly exceeding the prior 3-week average of ~297. This signals the onset of fierce December seasonality for tights (cold weather + holiday season). With on-hand inventory at 0 and demand trending aggressively upward (recent max 461, historic max 496), I must set parameters that anticipate high volume. Using `recent_N=6` for mu_hat captures the high-volatility peak season plateau (~350-460 range) while reacting to the latest spike. Keeping sigma_hat responsive with `recent_N=6` to account for the increasing variance seen in P37 (447) and P42 (461). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: December holiday surge confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 461 (+55% vs Nov avg ~297), signaling the start of intense winter peak seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (Dec 9). The previous period (P43) saw a surprising drop to 200 units, contrasting sharply with the P42 spike (461 units). This high volatility is characteristic of the peak winter season, where singular large orders or stockouts can distort weekly figures. Despite the P43 dip, I must treat the seasonal baseline as high-winter (Nov-Dec avg ~350+) rather than reacting solely to the latest low data point, especially with holiday shopping peaking mid-December. The 'explicit' method is used to override the dampening effect of the low P43 observation and maintain readiness for peaks >400 observed recently (P37, P42). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal volatility confirmed: Demand oscillates violently (461 in P42 -> 200 in P43), requiring buffers for ~460 unit peaks despite lower averages.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) is deep in the winter peak season. Recent demand has been erratic but high volume, characteristic of pre-Christmas shopping. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 461, followed by a drop to 200 in Period 43, and a rebound to 367 in Period 44. This volatility (ranging from 200 to 461) necessitates a robust safety stock approach. The recent average (last 3 periods) is ~343 units, but the peaks are the primary service risk. Given the high profit urgency ($4 profit vs $1 holding), we must cover the potential 460+ demand spikes rather than just the average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this intense short-term volatility (P42-P44) and ensure the inventory cap reflects the recent highs.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak volatility confirmed: Period 42-44 demand swings (461 -> 200 -> 367) show extreme variance typical of late-season gift shopping.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). We are in the absolute peak of the High-Winter season for tights. Demand in Period 45 hit a new record high of 468 units, causing a stockout. The recent demand pattern (P42-P45: 461, 200, 367, 468) shows extreme volatility (mean ~374, std dev ~125). Given the critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), understocking is far more costly than holding inventory. We use recent_N=4 for both mean and sigma to capture this specific holiday volatility window (the last 4 weeks) without being diluted by the lower November data. This sets a target base stock sufficiently high (~480 units) to cover another potential spike similar to P42 or P45.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak intensity confirmed: Period 45 demand hit new record of 468 units, validating extreme volatility and high volume immediately preceding Christmas.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (Dec 30) marks the end of the holiday peak. Demand reached 450 in P46, but historical Jan data suggests a reversion to ~200. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures the high season average (~350) to taper down inventory without a hard crash, while recent_N=5 for sigma_hat maintains a buffer against lingering holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas transition expected: Historical Jan baseline (~150-200) suggests demand will drop significantly from Dec peaks (~450-460) as gift-giving ends, though winter utility demand persists.
