The product is a multipack of tights (Box 4p Tights), and the date is February 11th, late winter, just before Valentine's Day. Tights are a seasonal basic for winter. Historical demand data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows a generally increasing trend (186, 151, 151, 198, 215), with the most recent week being the highest at 215. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders should arrive within the same period they are placed, ready to meet demand immediately. The OR algorithm recommends 205 units. Given the recent upward trend in demand (last two periods 198 and 215) and the 0-period lead time, the OR's recommendation based on the full average (including lower early Jan values) might be slightly conservative. However, with 0 on-hand, I must cover the entirety of this period's demand. The OR logic attempts to reach a base stock level. Calculating a simple average of the last 3 weeks: (151+198+215)/3 = 188. Simple average of all history = 180. The most recent demand is 215. To be safe and capture potential continued high demand in February, I will slightly increase the order to match recent peaks rather than the average, ensuring no stockout in this first critical period.",

Recent periods: Period 1 (203), Period 2 (313). There is a significant upward trend, with the most recent demand (313) far exceeding the historical mean (~180). Tights are a seasonal item often bought in colder months (Feb). The OR baseline calculates an order of 249 based on historical averages, likely underreacting to the P2 spike. Given the stockout in P2 (demand 313, sold 222), we missed significant sales. \n\nStep 3: Inventory Position. On-hand is 0. In-transit is 0. We currently have 0 stock to meet Period 3 demand. \n\nStep 4: Strategy. The OR recommends 249. However, the last demand was 313. If demand follows the recent trend or stays high (around 300+), 249 will lead to another stockout. With a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit 4 / Cost 1), stockouts are costly.

However, Period 6 demand surprisingly spiked back up to 237, causing a stockout (sold 211, demand 237). This suggests the decline was not as linear as thought, or perhaps fluctuating spring weather is maintaining demand for lighter tights (20 denier). The historical samples for late Jan/early Feb were ~150-215. The most recent three periods were 235, 170, 237.

The OR is reacting to the high variance and the recent stockout in Period 6. Given the volatility (170 -> 237), a higher safety stock is warranted. The product is '20 denier' tights, which are sheerer and suitable for spring transitions, potentially explaining the sustained demand compared to heavy winter tights. The OR target of 262 seems reasonable to cover the potential for another spike like Period 6 (237) or Period 4 (235) while rebuilding a small safety buffer. Since lead time is 0, we just need to cover this period's demand plus a small hedge.\n\nConclusion: Be slightly conservative relative to the peak but cover the recent average + volatility. 262 is a good target.

It seems the baseline has caught up to the current 'spring stable' regime.\n\n5. **Final Strategy**:\n   - Lead time is 0. My order needs to cover demand for Period 8 only (plus safety stock).\n   - Forecast: Demand seems stable around 240. \n   - Calculation: Target Inventory = Expected Demand (240) + Safety Stock. Given the high stockout cost vs holding cost (Ratio 4:1), we want high service level. \n   - Base Stock: If mean is ~240, safety stock (Z=0.84 for 80% service, or higher due to high margins) might add ~40 units. Target ~280.\n   - Current Position: 19.\n   - Order = Target - OnHand = 280 - 19 = 261.\n   - OR (244) results in Total Supply = 19 + 244 = 263. This is very close to my estimated target.\n   - Decision: The OR recommendation of 244 puts us at 263 total supply. With recent demand at 243, this leaves a safety buffer of 20 units. Given the volatility (demand jumped 170->237), a slightly larger buffer is safer. I will slightly increase the order to ensure total supply covers a potential spike back to ~250-260 plus buffer.\n   - Order Calculation: Let's aim for ~275 total supply to be safe against variance. Order = 275 - 19 = 256. Or simply rounding the OR up slightly to 260.\n   - Let's stick closer to the OR but pad slightly for the stockout risk seen in Period 6. Order = 260.",

Effectively starting from scratch to cover today's demand. \n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. We are in mid-June (Period 19, 2019/6/17), historically a low season for tights. The recent trend is a sharp decline: Period 16=157, Period 17=99, Period 18=127. The 3-period average is ~128 units, significantly lower than the OR's historical mean which is polluted by high winter/spring data. The slight uptick in P18 (127 vs 99) suggests the floor might be around 100-130 rather than continuing to freefall to zero immediately, but demand is clearly in a summer trough.\n\nStep 3: Strategy. The OR recommendation of 256 is far too high because it averages all history (including peaks >300). Following it would result in massive overstock during summer. A target inventory level of around 150 units provides ample coverage for the current ~128 average with safety stock (Critical Fractile q=0.8 suggests high service level, but volatility is low in the off-season). \n\nCalculation: Target 150.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Extra data: line 1 column 5 (char 4)]
2019-06-24 (Summer) - Period 20

**1. Lead Time & Inventory Analysis**
- **Lead Time:** Consistently **0 periods**. Every order has arrived same-period (Period 19 ordered 145, arrived 145).
- **Inventory:**
  - On-hand: 69 units
  - In-transit: 0 units
  - Total Supply available for Period 20 demand: 69 + Order_20.

**2. Demand Analysis (Summer Trough)**
- **Recent Pattern:** Demand has plummeted as expected for summer.
  - Period 14-15 (May): ~216 avg
  - Period 16 (Late May): 157
  - Period 17 (Early June): 99
  - Period 18 (Mid June): 127
  - Period 19 (Late June): 83
- **Latest Signal:** Period 19 demand (83) is the lowest yet, confirming the deep summer trough. The 3-week average is now ~103 units.
- **Forecasting:** Late June/Early July is likely the absolute bottom for tights demand. We should expect strictly low demand, likely between 80-110 units.

**3. OR Recommendation Critique (192 units)**
- **OR Logic:** The OR baseline uses all historical data (including Feb/March peaks of ~300) to calculate its mean, making it extremely sluggish to react to the sharp seasonal downturn.
- **Critique:** An order of 192 would result in Total Supply = 69 + 192 = 261.
- **Implication:** If demand is only ~90, we would be left with ~171 units of holding stock ($171 cost). This is excessive coverage (nearly 2 periods of summer demand). The OR is substantially over-ordering.

**4. Final Strategy & Calculation**
- **Goal:** Cover Period 20 demand plus a small safety stock.
- **Forecast:** Estimated demand ~95 units (avg of last 3 weeks: 83, 127, 99).
- **Target Inventory:** We need enough to cover ~95 units + safety stock. Let's aim for ~115 units total coverage to be safe against a minor fluctuation back to ~120.
- **Calculation:**
  - Target Total: 115
  - Current On-hand: 69
  - Order Needed: 115 - 69 = 46.
- **Safety Check:** If demand spikes to 127 again (Period 18 level), 69 + 46 = 115 is slightly short, but acceptable given holding costs. Let's buffer slightly higher to ~125 total to ensure we don't stock out if it hits 127.
- **Revised Order:** 125 - 69 = 56. Let's round to 60 for simplicity.

The OR's recommendation of 192 is dangerously high for the current low-demand summer regime. I will aggressively cut the order.

The 4-week average is ~87, but the most recent point (41) suggests we are hitting the true seasonal floor. The OR model calculates recommendations based on the full history (mean ~200+), which is heavily skewed by Feb-Apr peaks, resulting in a recommendation of 172 units. This is far too high for July.\n\nStep 3: Strategy. We need to cover demand for Period 21. If demand mirrors P20 (~41) or drops slightly further, our current inventory of 88 units covers ~2 periods of demand comfortably. Even if demand spikes back to the P19 level (83), we have enough coverage (88 > 83). Placing an order now would likely incur unnecessary holding costs as demand stays low in July/August.

======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical data, here is the decision rationale and recommended action.

### **RATIONALE**

**1. Lead Time & Inventory Analysis**  
- **Lead Time:** The system consistently demonstrates a **0-period lead time** (orders placed in Period $N$ arrive and are sold in Period $N$). Every single "conclude" message from Period 1 to 25 confirms this.  
- **Inventory Position:**  
  - Current On-Hand: 34 units.  
  - In-Transit: 0 units.  
  - Total Pipeline: 34 units.  
- **Stockout Risk:** Minimal currently because demand is extremely low, but we must cover demand for the current week (August 5).

**2. Demand Analysis & Seasonality**  
- **Seasonal Context:** We are in early August (Period 26). Demand for tights is at its deepest seasonal trough ("Summer Trough").
- **Recent Demand Trend:**
  - Period 22: 53
  - Period 23: 30
  - Period 24: 9
  - Period 25: 19
  - **4-week Average:** ~28 units.
  - **Trend:** Demand bottomed out at 9 units in late July and ticked up slightly to 19 last week. This slight uptick might indicate the very beginning of the "Back to School" or early autumn transition, but we are still deep in the low-demand regime.
- **Forecast:** We anticipate demand to remain low (range 20-40) for another few weeks before ramping up in September.

**3. OR Recommendation Evaluation**  
- **OR Proposal:** 214 units.  
- **Critique:** The OR model is averaging all history (including the massive peaks of 300+ in spring), resulting in a base stock level that is wildly excessive for August. Placing an order of 214 units now would result in massive overstock holding costs, as we are currently selling ~20 units/week.  
- **Adjustment:** We must drastically undercut the OR recommendation. We need to cover the potential slight recovery (e.g., if demand jumps back to ~30-40) plus a small safety margin.

**4. Final Order Calculation**  
- **Target Stock Level:** Given the volatility of the recovery (it could jump from 9 to 19 to 40 quickly as autumn approaches), a safe target is around **60 units**. This covers ~2 weeks of current demand or 1 week of "recovery" demand.
- **Calculation:** Target (60) - Pipeline (34) = **26 units**.  
- **Refinement:** The OR suggests 214, which implies it sees high variance in the history. While we disagree with the mean, a slight buffer is wise. Let's target covering a demand of roughly 50-60 units to be safe against a sudden August spike (e.g., unusual weather). 
- **Action:** Order **30 units**.
  - Total available = 34 (on hand) + 30 (order) = 64 units.
  - This comfortably covers the recent max of 53 units while avoiding the holding costs of the OR's suggested 200+ inventory stack.

{
  "rationale": "We are in the deep summer trough (August 5), with recent demand averaging ~28 units (last 4 weeks) and a low of 9. The OR recommendation (214) is heavily biased by high historical spring demand and fails to account for summer seasonality. We override the OR to prevent massive overstocking. We target a total inventory coverage of ~64 units (covering the recent high of 53) by ordering 30 units to supplement the 34 on hand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Drastically reduced OR recommendation (214 -> 30) due to deep summer seasonality; recent weekly demand is ~20-30 units, making the OR's target excessive.",

Ending inventory is 0 (stockout), meaning we have no buffer entering Period 27. Demand must be met entirely by the current order.\n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Period 26 demand spiked to 84 units, a dramatic increase from Period 25 (19 units) and Period 24 (9 units). This signals the definitive end of the summer trough and the start of the Autumn/Back-to-School season (Current date: Aug 12). While the upward trend is sharp, demand is not yet at the historical Winter/Spring peak levels (200-300+).\n\nStep 3: OR Assessment. The OR baseline (245 units) is heavily weighted by high historical demand from Q1/Q2. Applying the full 245 unit order now would likely result in overstocking, as we are only in the early stages of the ramp-up phase.\n\nStep 4: Strategy. We anticipate demand will continue to grow from the current 84 level, potentially reaching the 100-130 range given the steep slope of recovery. With stockout costs ($4) being 4x holding costs ($1), we prioritize service level. We will set the order quantity to 145 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the demand history and current date (August 19), here is the rationale and decision for Period 28.

### **Rationale**

1.  **Lead Time Analysis**:
    *   Confirming "0 periods" lead time. Orders placed in Period N arrive and are available *during* Period N.
    *   Observation: In Period 27, we ordered 145, and 145 arrived, satisfying demand partially.

2.  **Demand Analysis (Seasonality & Trend)**:
    *   **Context**: The product is 20 denier tights. We are in mid-late August (Period 28 = Aug 19).
    *   **Recent Shift**: The summer trough (demand ~9-50 units) is emphatically over.
        *   Period 26: 84 units (Start of recovery).
        *   Period 27: 197 units (Surge).
    *   **Stockout**: We stocked out in both Period 26 and Period 27 (Ending inventory = 0 for both). The true demand in P27 was at least 197, potentially higher if customers turned away, though standard recording shows 197.
    *   **FORECAST**: The surge to 197 is consistent with "Back to School" / Autumn preparation. Looking back to Spring/Winter levels, demand can easily reach 200-300 range (Period 3 was ~300).
    *   We should treat the current regime as "Autumn Ramp-up." We can expect demand to stay near or above 200.

3.  **Inventory & Supply**:
    *   **On-hand**: 0 units.
    *   **Pipeline**: 0 units.
    *   **Stockout Risk**: Very High. We have zero buffer coming into a demand surge.

4.  **OR Recommendation vs. Strategy**:
    *   **OR Recommendation**: 245 units.
    *   **Analysis**: The OR is reacting fast to the variance, likely picking up the 197 and calculating a high safety stock needed for the volatility.
    *   **Calculation**:
        *   Expected Demand: Likely 200-240 range given the trajectory (84 -> 197 -> ?).
        *   Target Inventory: The OR's 245 covers the P27 demand (197) + ~25% buffer.
        *   Given the rapid acceleration, demand could exceed 230. A quantity of ~275 would be safer to rebuild the buffer (which is currently 0) and catch upside volatility, but the OR's 245 is a strong increase from previous weeks.
        *   Let's aggressively follow the upward trend. If P27 was 197, P28 could easily be 220+. We need to cover demand *plus* leave some closing stock to stop the stockout cycle.
    *   **Adjustment**: I will slightly increase the OR recommendation to ~275 to ensure we break the stockout cycle. 245 might just barely cover demand if it grows again, leaving us with 0 inventory *again*. We need ending inventory > 0.
    *   Let's aim for ~270.

### **Short Rationale for Human**
Demand has surged for the Autumn transition, jumping from 84 to 197 units last period. We stocked out completely in Period 27. I am increasing the OR recommendation from 245 to 270 units to ensure we not only meet the rising demand (likely >200) but also finally rebuild a safety buffer after consecutive stockouts.

### **Carry-Over Insights**
Autumn ramp-up confirmed: Period 27 demand (197) is more than double Period 26, signalling the end of summer low season.

```json
{
  "rationale": "Lead Time is 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current inventory is 0 due to consecutive stockouts in P26 and P27. Demand has aggressively shifted from the summer trough (low of 9) to an Autumn ramp-up (197 in P27). This reflects the 'Back to School' / late-August seasonality for tights. The OR suggests 245, which is a good baseline, but given the velocity of the increase (84 -> 197), and the fact we have 0 starting stock, we risk stocking out again if demand grows even slightly (e.g., to 230). I will increase the order to 270 to ensure coverage of continued growth and to re-establish a positive safety stock level.",

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step analysis for Period 29 (late August decision):\n\n1.  **Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis**: Orders consistently arrive same-period (lead_time=0 confirmed in all concluding messages). Current on-hand is 121 units. No in-transit inventory.\n\n2.  **Demand Trends & Seasonality**: We are in late August (2019/8/26). The 'Autumn Ramp-up' detected in Period 27 is confirmed but volatile. \n    - Period 26: 84 units\n    - Period 27: 197 units\n    - Period 28: 149 units\n    - This fluctuation (84 -> 197 -> 149) averages ~143 over the last 3 weeks. However, looking at the same time last year or general seasonality for tights, demand climbs rapidly as September/Autumn approaches. The jump to 197 in P27 indicates the potential for high demand is back.\n\n3.  **OR Recommendation Review**: The OR recommends 122 units. \n    - OR likely sees the overall historical average (dragged down by summer lows of ~9-50 units). \n    - OR Target Inventory = On-hand (121) + Order (122) = 243.\n\n4.  **Forecasting & Adjustment**: \n    - Recent peak was 197. Recent average of active ramp-up is ~173 (avg of P27/P28). \n    - We should prepare for demand likely returning to the 200+ range soon as September starts next week. \n    - A safe target level would be cover the recent peak (197) plus safety stock. Let's aim closer to 240-250 total coverage.\n    - Current inventory is 121. To reach ~250, we need ~130 units. \n    - The OR recommendation of 122 is extremely close to this logic (121+122=243). \n    - Given the volatility (P27 stockout, P28 leftover), ensuring we cover a potential spike back to 200 is key. \n    - The OR's 122 results in 243 total. If demand is 197 again, we have ~46 buffer. If demand drops to 149, we have ~94 buffer cost. Given the 4:1 profit/holding ratio, stocking out is much worse. \n\n5.  **Final Decision**: I will slightly increase the OR recommendation to ensure we solidly cover the 197-200 range with safety stock, anticipating September growth. A target of ~250-260 seems safer. Let's order 140 units (Total = 261).",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1: Analyze Lead Time and Supply. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 29, 140 units ordered arrived immediately. Current on-hand is 147 units. No in-transit inventory.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Demand and Seasonality. We are at Period 30 (Sep 2). The product is 20 denier tights. Historical context and recent carry-over insights confirm that the deep summer trough (July: ~30 units) is over. August (Periods 26-29) showed high volatility with an average of ~136 units/week (84 -> 197 -> 149 -> 114). The drop to 114 in P29 is likely noise within a larger upward 'Autumn ramp-up' trend. As temperatures drop in September, demand for tights typically increases significantly back towards the spring/winter baseline of 200-300 units.\n\nStep 3: Forecast and Strategy. The 4-week average is ~136. However, given the date (early Sep), I anticipate demand will stabilize or grow, likely fluctuating between 140-180 in the short term. The OR recommendation is 94 units. If used, Total Supply = 147 (on-hand) + 94 = 241. This covers the immediate volatility seen in August (specifically the 197 spike). While demand fell to 114 last week, risking a stockout during the autumn ramp-up is costly (Profit=4 vs Holding=1). The OR seems slightly conservative given the recent 197 peak, but my current inventory (147) is already substantial. I need to cover potential demand spikes up to ~250. Target inventory = 250. Order = 250 - 147 = 103. This is close to the OR (94) but adds a small safety buffer for the autumn volatility.",

We are deep in the Autumn season, approaching Winter (peak tights season).\n- Recent Demand: P33 saw a massive spike to 496 (likely an outlier or stock-up event), followed by P34 at 358. \n- The average of the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is approx. (274+255+496+358)/4 = 346 units.\n- Early year data (Feb/Mar) showed peaks around 300-320. The current Autumn surge is surpassing Spring levels, with P33 hitting nearly 500.\n- Volatility is high. P34 demand (358) confirms that while P33 (496) might have been extreme, the new baseline is likely well above 300.\n\nStep 3: OR Algorithm Evaluation\n- OR recommends 203 units.\n- Current on-hand is 72.\n- Total Inventory with OR order = 72 + 203 = 275 units.\n- This is significantly below the recent demand average (~346) and below the last observed demand (358).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical analysis, here is the decision for Period 36.

### Rationale
1.  **Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis**: The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand is 71 units, and there are 0 units in transit. This means to cover Period 36 demand, I rely entirely on on-hand stock plus the new order placed now.
2.  **Demand Analysis**: We are in mid-October (2019/10/14), a peak season for tights. Recent demand has been extremely high: P33 (496), P34 (358), and P35 (351). The average over the last 3 periods is ~401 units, though the 496 outlier makes a pure average risky. A more stable "high baseline" seems to be around 350-360 units. This is significantly higher than the OR baseline thinks, as the OR is likely dragged down by the summer trough data in its historical averaging.
3.  **Inventory Strategy**: The OR recommends 210 units. With 71 on-hand, that would provide 281 units total. This is dangerously low given that demand has exceeded 350 for three consecutive weeks. I need 350 units just to meet expected demand, plus safety stock.
4.  **Calculation**:
    *   Estimated Demand ($\mu$): ~360 units (conservative estimate based on P34/P35).
    *   Safety Stock: Given high volatility (std dev > 50) and critical fractile 0.8, I'll aim for a target inventory around 420-430 units to prevent stockouts like in P33.
    *   Target Total Inventory: 430 units.
    *   Current Position: 71 units.
    *   Order Quantity: 430 - 71 = 359 units.
5.  **Final Adjustment**: I will order 360 units. This creates a total capacity of 431 units, providing coverage for the sustained ~350 demand level plus a buffer for another spike like P33.

### Short Rationale for Human
Overriding OR's 210 units because it significantly underestimates the current Autumn peak. Recent demand has consistently exceeded 350 units (avg ~400 last 3 weeks). Ordering 360 units to bring total availability to 431, ensuring coverage for the sustained high volume.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current state and historical data, here is the decision for Period 42.

**1. Lead Time & Inventory Status**
- **Lead Time:** Consistently observed as **0 periods** (immediate arrival for current period sales). This allows for a "Chase" strategy where we order exactly what we need for the current period's projected demand.
- **Current Inventory:** 178 units on hand. 0 in transit.
- **Holding Costs:** We have been carrying ~160-190 units of ending inventory for the last 3 periods (since Period 38), costing ~$170/period. This suggests our previous targets (~460-470 total units) were slightly too aggressive for the realized demand of ~270-320.

**2. Demand Analysis**
- **Recent Trend:** Demand has cooled from the October highs (peaks ~450) to a stable range in November: P39(322), P40(271), P41(285). The recent 3-period average is ~293 units.
- **Seasonality (World Knowledge):** The current date is **November 25, 2019**, which marks the start of **Black Friday week**. Tights are a high-volume retail item during this promotional period and the onset of colder winter weather.
- **Regime:** We remain in the high-volume Autumn/Winter regime. The dip in Periods 40-41 may be a "calm before the storm" of holiday shopping.
- **OR Baseline:** The OR recommends 125 units, targeting a total of (178+125)=303. This is dangerously close to the recent average (293) and would stock out if we see even a mild spike back to Period 39 levels (322).

**3. Strategy**
- **Stockout Cost vs Holding Cost:** Profit margin is $4/unit vs Holding cost $1/unit. It is 4x more expensive to miss a sale than to hold a unit. We should err on the side of overstocking, especially during a holiday week.
- **Target Inventory:** Given Black Friday week, relying on the "cooling" average of ~280 is risky. We should buffer for a demand spike closer to the October average. A target of **400 units** balances the recent cooling (285) with the upside potential seen in Period 37 (447).
- **Calculation:** Target (400) - On-Hand (178) = Order 222.
- **Adjustment:** We will order 225 units to reach a total available stock of 403, securing service level for the holiday week while trimming slightly from the previous weeks' aggressive targets (460+).

Let's aim to cover demand up to 470-480 to prevent stockouts during the holiday rush.\n- Order Calculation: Target 480 - OnHand 0 - InTransit 0 = 480.\n- Order Decision: I will order 480 units to aggressively restock and safeguard against December peaks.",

{
  "rationale": "Period 47 corresponds to the week of December 30th (New Year's Eve), a critical event for tights (party wear). Recent demand (Periods 42, 45, 46) has repeatedly hit the 450-470 range, significantly above the OR's baseline which is dragged down by summer troughs. While historical data (Jan 2019 samples) suggests a drop to ~180-200 in January, the current week likely sustains holiday momentum. A stockout costs $4/unit in lost profit, while holding costs only $1/unit. Given the recent peaks (468, 450) and the high cost of lost sales, the optimal strategy ignores the potential post-Christmas dip risk in favor of service level. Target Inventory Position set to 450 units. With 20 units on hand and 0-period lead time, an order of 430 is required.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 430 units to reach a total inventory of 450. This covers the sustained holiday peak (recent demand ~450) for New Year's Eve week, mitigating the high stockout risks seen in Periods 42 and 45.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday season confirms extreme volatility (range 200-468). Period 47 (NYE) is expected to be the final high-volume week before a likely regime shift back to lower historical Jan/Feb levels (~180-200) in Period 48.",
