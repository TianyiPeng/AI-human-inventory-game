Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11): Starting with no history for this simulation run, I rely on the provided 5-week historical samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) for forecasting. The demand average is approx. 114 units/week. Since profit ($4.0) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1.0), the service level target z* will be around 0.84 (z* \u2248 1.0). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a staple item with fairly stable demand in the provided history. I will use the 'explicit' method for the mean to align closely with the provided historical average (114) and 'explicit' for sigma based on the sample standard deviation (approx 15.2). Lead time is promised as 0. I will start with conservative estimates based on the full pre-game history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18). Demand in Period 1 was 114, matching the historical average exactly. Observed lead time in Period 1 was 0 periods (same-period arrival), confirming the promised lead time. Inventory is low (13 units) due to high sell-through. We will use the full available history (5 historical + 1 simulation period = 6 samples) to estimate parameters solely on recent data, assuming stationarity for now. L is set to default as observed matches promised.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/2/25. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). Demand in Period 2 spiked significantly to 231 units (vs historical avg ~114), resulting in a stockout and 0 ending inventory. This spike coincides with the week of Presidents Day (Feb 18), potentially explaining the surge. With a high profit-to-holding ratio ($4:$1), the cost of lost sales is high (critical fractile 0.8). To recover inventory and protect against continued high demand without over-indexing on a single data point, I will use `recent_N` with N=3 for demand parameters. This blends the spike (231) with recent normal weeks (114, 95), raising the target stock level appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $806.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (March 4th). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods. A distinct demand regime shift occurred in Period 2 and has been sustained through Period 3. Average demand for the last two periods (217) is nearly double the prior historical average (~115), likely driven by seasonal spring demand for sneaker socks. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat immediately adapts to this new high-volume level. Using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat incorporates the volatility of the jump itself, providing a safety buffer (critical ratio 0.8 favors service over holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean increased from ~115 to ~217 starting Period 2 (evidence: P2=231, P3=203).

=== Period 4 Summary ===
160442007: ordered=263, arrived=263 units (ordered on Period 4, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=269, demand=138, sold=138, ending on-hand inventory=131

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 observations: On-hand is 131. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Demand pattern shows high recent volatility: after a spike in P2 (231) and P3 (203), P4 dropped to 138. This 138 is still above the pre-game average (~114) but significantly below the recent peak. With a high critical ratio (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the risk of stocking out is costlier than holding inventory. Thus, I will use a 3-period rolling average (approx 191) for mu_hat to capture the recent high volume while acknowledging the P4 drop, rather than reverting essentially to the pre-game mean. Sigma is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the widened range [138, 231].

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P2-P4 shows erratic range [138, 231] with 3-period mean ~191, challenging the stability of the previously detected high regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (Mid-March): Demand has dropped in the last two periods (P4=138, P5=147, avg~143) compared to the P2-P3 spike (avg~217). While the extreme high regime appears to be subsiding, the volatility remains high, and current demand is still above the pre-game baseline (~114). Given the high cost of stocking out (Critical Ratio 0.8), I am using a moving window of N=3 (P3, P4, P5) to forecast demand. This blends the recent lower values with the last high value (P3=203) to prevent understocking if demand rebounds, while reacting to the downward trend. Lead time is consistently 0, so 'default' is used.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility update: The high demand regime (P2-P3 avg ~217) has not been sustained; P4-P5 avg dropped to ~143. Volatility remains high across the observed period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (March 25) marks full spring, fitting for 'Sneaker Socks'. Inventory is depleted (0 units) following a stockout in Period 6 where demand spiked to 214, exceeding the previous period's lower trend. This resurgence invalidates the hypothesis that demand had permanently settled near 140. The demand pattern is characterized by high volatility (alternating between ~140 and ~230). To maintain the 0.8 service level target amidst this fluctuation, I am switching to a 5-period window which captures the full high-volatility regime (average ~187) rather than reacting solely to the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as persistent characteristic; Period 6 rebound to 214 units disproves the 'regime drop' hypothesis. 5-period mean is now ~187 with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date (April 1st) aligns with strong seasonal demand for sneaker socks. P7 demand hit a record 285 units, causing a second consecutive stockout. The demand trend over P5-P7 is sharply positive (147->214->285), suggesting a seasonal ramp-up rather than random volatility. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), the policy must adjust aggressively to these recent highs to prevent further service failures. I am using recent_N=3 for demand parameters to capture this new high-volume regime (Avg ~215, Std ~69) while filtering slightly for noise. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal ramp-up confirmed: Demand consistently increased (147->214->285) from P5 to P7 as dates entered Spring (April), outpacing the previous P2-P3 high regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (Sprint/April) sees continued strong seasonal demand growth for sneaker socks. Demand has risen consecutively from P5 (147) to P8 (320), a +117% increase in 4 weeks. This steep trend has caused stockouts in P6, P7, and P8 because historical averages (Moving Average) lag behind the rapid ascent. To prevent another stockout, I am switching to an explicit forecast of 340 (projecting the trend) and an explicit sigma of 60 (approximate volatility of recent high-variance period), ensuring the base stock covers the anticipated peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal surge intensifies: Demand hit 320 in P8 (up from 147 in P5), consistently outpacing N=3 averages and causing stockouts. Trend indicates need for leading forecast rather than lagging average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $509.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15) is mid-Spring. The product (Sneaker Socks) is highly relevant as consumers switch to low-top shoes. Demand history shows a strong seasonal ramp-up (147->214->285->320) followed by a sharp drop in Period 9 (180). This drop to 180 is unexpected given the trend, but high volatility is a confirmed characteristic. The drop might be a temporary fluctuation or a signal that the initial surge is stabilizing. The 5-period average is now ~229, and the 3-period average is ~261. Given the high volatility and the recent shock drop to 180 (despite the trend hitting 320), a purely reactive `recent_N` might over-index on the 180 or the 320. However, the drop to 180 brought inventory to 211 units, so we have a healthy buffer. I will use a `recent_N` with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture the high recent volatility (180 vs 320) without overreacting to a single point. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatility intensified in P9: Demand dropped sharply to 180 after peaking at 320 in P8, indicating extreme range [180, 320] within a 2-week span during peak season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (April 22) represents mid-Spring, where sneaker socks demand remains relevant. We observed a significant peak in P8 (320 units) followed by a retraction in P9 (180) and P10 (209). While the immediate past two periods average ~195, the volatility remains high (standard deviation of last 5 periods > 50). Since the cost of lost sales ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1), a stockout is expensive. We select N=5 for estimation to capture the recent high-volume regime (avg ~242) rather than reacting solely to the recent dip, ensuring coverage if demand spikes again. Lead time remains effectively 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand in P9-P10 (avg ~195) suggests the P8 peak (320) was a transient spike. High volatility persists, but mean level appears to be reverting to the P6/P10 range (~210).

Current date is April 29 (late Spring), and the product (Sneaker Socks) continues to see strong seasonal demand. After the volatility of Period 8 (peak 320) and Period 9 (drop to 180), demand has established a steady upward recovery trend in the last three periods (180 -> 209 -> 233). Relying on a short memory (N=3) would underestimate demand (avg ~207) and risk stockouts given the current level of 233. Therefore, I propose using N=4 (periods 8-11: 320, 180, 209, 233) for both mean and volatility. This sets a higher forecast baseline (~235) and captures the significant recent variance to buffer against potential recurring spikes in May. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand recovery confirms upward trend: periods 9-11 show linear growth (180->209->233), establishing a robust seasonal floor ~210 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 demand surged to 293, confirming a strong seasonal upward trend (180->209->233->293). Current on-hand is 0. Using simple averages would underestimate demand in this climbing phase. Lead time remains 0. Setting explicit mu_hat=300 to anticipate continued high demand near the P8/P12 peaks, and recent_N=4 for sigma to capture the high volatility (std dev ~48).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed: Linear growth 180->209->233->293 from P9-P12 indicates strong seasonality for sneaker socks in May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (May 13th) places us firmly in the spring/early summer season, ideal for 'sneaker socks'. Reviewing recent demand, we see a clear upward trend from Period 9 (180) to Period 12 (293), followed by a slight dip in Period 13 (227). This dip (227) is still significantly higher than the early-season average. The 5-period average (P9-P13) is approximately 228 units, while the 3-period average is 251 units. The volatility remains high, with demand swinging from 180 to 293 in a month. Given the stockout in Period 12 and the general upward seasonal trend since April, relying on a purely lagging average might understock. However, the drop in P13 suggests the linear growth might be pausing or oscillating. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (approx 228) to capture the broader high-demand spring regime without over-indexing on the single peak of 293 or the single dip of 227. For sigma, I will use recent_N=5 (std dev ~42) to account for the recent fluctuations. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand plateau: After linear growth P9-P12 (180->293), demand dipped to 227 in P13, suggesting a high-level oscillation around ~240 rather than infinite linear growth.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 15 (2019/5/20). Product: Sneaker Socks (high summer seasonality expected). 

Review of History:
- Recent demand (last 5): 209 (P10), 233 (P11), 293 (P12), 227 (P13), 212 (P14).
- The strong linear growth trend observed in P9-P12 (180->293) has paused, stabilizing into a range of [212, 227] for the last two periods.
- Current on-hand is low (52 units) after sustained demand > 210 units.
- This indicates a high plateau rather than a crash. Summer seasonality for sneaker socks suggests demand will remain robust or climb again as temperatures rise in late May/June.
- Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods (same-day delivery).
- Given the high service level target (critical_ratio = 4/5 = 0.8), running out of stock (like in P6, P7, P8, P12) is costly. 
- Mean Forecast: The average of the last 3 periods (293, 227, 212) is ~244. The average of the last 5 is ~235. The recent dip to 210s is safer to anchor on but with a buffer for summer spikes.
- Volatility: Demand has swung from 138 to 320 over the season; recent volatility is lower but risks remain. 

Decision:
- L: Keep default (0 periods) as no delays observed.
- mu_hat: Use 'recent_N' with N=5 (avg ~235) to capture the sustained high volume of May without overreacting to the single P12 spike or the slight cooling in P14.
- sigma_hat: Use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau established: Demand standardized around ~220-230 units in mid-May (P13-P14) after rapid April growth, confirming sustained high-season volume.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (Late May) enters peak summer season for sneaker socks. Period 15 demand surged to 301 units, causing a stockout and shattering the stabilization theory from P13-P14. Demand is now oscillating violently between ~210 (P14) and ~300 (P15, P12). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and 0 inventory starting position, I am switching to N=4 to capture the full amplitude of these recent swings (two peaks ~300, two troughs ~220) rather than smoothing them out too much. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High seasonal volatility confirmed: Period 15 spike (301) broke the P13-P14 plateau (~220), matching late April highs. Demand oscillates between ~210 and ~300. Volatility management required.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (June 3) marks the start of summer proper, and demand for sneaker socks remains high. Periods 15 and 16 showed strong, sustained volume (301, 290 units), suggesting the oscillation seen in May might be stabilizing at the higher end of the seasonal range (~300). Current on-hand is critical (7 units). I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full scope of the recent Spring/Summer ramp-up (avg ~265) while accounting for the significant variance (std dev ~42) seen in the last month. N=5 is chosen over N=3 to prevent over-reacting to the very recent highs, while still acknowledging the seasonal floor is now likely above 210. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak sustained: P15-P16 demand (avg ~295) holds at the upper bound of the seasonal range, suggesting a shift from Spring oscillation to consistent high volume for June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) context: Following a sustained high-demand period in May (avg ~260 for P12-P16), Period 17 saw a sudden, massive drop to 98 units, despite 290 units requested just the week prior. This drop is extreme (-66%) and likely an outlier or a specific calendar anomaly (e.g., post-holiday lull or weather event), as June is typically high season for sneaker socks. However, given the high volatility (range [98, 301] in the last 3 periods), relying solely on the most recent sample is dangerous. The 4-period average (P14-P17) is ~225, and the 6-period average (P12-P17) is ~236. The 98-unit demand created a surplus of 202 units on hand. To prevent overreaction to a single low point while respecting the overall seasonal high, I will use a robust 'recent_N' estimator (N=5), which captures the strong May performance while diluting the P17 dip. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly in Period 17: Sudden drop to 98 units after sustained high season (avg ~260), indicating extreme volatility or potential noise in early June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are observing a fierce regime correction down from the Spring peak. Demand dropped from ~290 (late May) to 98 and now 68 (mid-June), confirming a sharp seasonal decline or satisfying of seasonal demand. With 226 units on hand, we have ample coverage (over 3 weeks at current 'low' rates, or 1 full week if demand unexpectedly snaps back to ~220). The priority now is to stop inflow until the new baseline stabilizes. I am switching to a reactive N=3 forecast, which blends the recent drop with the last high period (P16) to capture the extreme volatility (sigma) while lowering the mean target, likely triggering a zero or minimal order to drain excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer Slump confirmed: Demand crashed in June (P17: 98, P18: 68) after May peak (avg ~270), signaling end of high season; Seasonal volatility is extreme (range 68-301 in last 4 weeks).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has firmly settled into a low summer regime (avg ~86 over last 3 periods), significantly down from the May peak. The 'Summer Slump' identified in P17-19 is persistent. Holding 163 units covers nearly 2 periods of current demand. Switching parameters to recent_N=3 allows the OR engine to see the low mean (85.7) and lower variance, preventing overstocking while demand remains suppressed.

Carry-over insight: Summer Slump stabilized: Periods 17-19 averaged 85.7 units, confirming a 70% drop from May peak levels. Demand is now consistently <100.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st) confirms the continuation of a lower-demand summer regime compared to the Spring peak, but with significant volatility. While periods 17-19 averaged ~86 units, Period 20 rebounded to 139, breaking the sub-100 trend. Current on-hand inventory is low (24 units). To respond to this volatility while acknowledging the overall lower seasonal tier, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for both demand and volatility. This window captures the varied 'Summer' performance (P17-P20 values: 98, 68, 91, 139), yielding a mean forecast of ~99 units, which positions inventory for a potential moderate recovery without overstocking to Spring levels. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer Slump volatility update: Demand rebounded to 139 in Period 20, contradicting the previous sub-100 stability. The summer regime (P17-P20) now averages ~99 units with a wide range [68, 139], indicating high volatility and a floor potentially higher than initial June lows suggested.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) reflects a confirmed recovery trend from the June 'Summer Slump'. Demand has risen consecutively for 3 periods: 91 (P19) -> 139 (P20) -> 160 (P21). The slump bottomed out in P18 (68 units), and the current trajectory suggests a return to typical summer volumes (closer to the ~200-300 range seen in May). Because lagging averages (e.g., N=3 avg ~130) severely under-forecast the current level (160) and caused a stockout in P21, an explicit forecast of 170 is used to lead the trend. Sigma is calculated on N=5 to capture the high volatility of the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Recovery from Summer Slump confirmed: Demand increased consecutively (91 -> 139 -> 160) from P19 to P21, signaling a return to higher volume after the June dip.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). We are in a strong recovery phase following the June slump. Demand has risen linearly for 4 periods (91 -> 139 -> 160 -> 218). Pattern Matching: The current demand level (P22=218) is nearly identical to P6 (214) and P14 (212). Historical data shows that in both previous instances, demand spiked significantly in the following period (P7=285, P15=301). Given this strong precedent and the high cost of lost sales (ratio 4:1), we anticipate a similar surge. A lagging average would critically understock; therefore, we use an explicit forecast of 285 to capture the expected peak. We use recent volatility (N=4) to account for the rapid ascent.

Carry-over insight: Rebound Spike Pattern identified: Historical analysis (P6->P7, P14->P15) confirms that when demand recovers to ~215 units during the active season, the subsequent period often spikes to ~285-300 units. P22 demand (218) triggers this proactive scaling signal.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 demand dropped sharply to 80 units, contradicting the 'recovery' trend observed in Periods 20-22 (reaching 218 units). This drastic oscillation creates a high-volatility regime in July (range [80, 218]). Current on-hand inventory is 250 units, which exceeds the recent maximum demand of 218, providing a substantial safety buffer. Consequently, the strategy shifts from aggressive trend-following to stability. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 incorporates both the spike (218) and the drop (80) into a smoothed average (~150), preventing knee-jerk over-ordering while maintaining awareness of the variance.

Carry-over insight: July volatility confirmed: The linear recovery pattern (P19-P22) was broken by P23 (drop to 80). The period is characterized by extreme oscillation [80, 218] rather than a sustained trend, necessitating volatility-aware smoothing.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Deep summer slump confirmed with P24 reaching historical low of 40 units. Recent P21-P24 average is ~125 with extreme volatility. We use recent_N=5 to capture the full range of this erratic summer behavior (from 218 highs to 40 lows) while reacting to the downward trend. On-hand inventory of 210 is sufficient to cover immediate demand, likely resulting in no order to burn down excess.

Carry-over insight: Summer Slump deepening: Demand hit historical low of 40 units in P24, confirming a pattern of extreme volatility in July (range [40, 218] in last 3 weeks). The trend line is currently steeply negative.

Daily Reward (R_t): $465.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August. The 'Summer Slump' noticed in June and the extreme volatility in July (hitting a low of 40 in P24 followed by a rebound to 135 in P25) suggests the deep trough might be ending as we approach 'Back to School' or Autumn transitions. The most recent demand points (P24=40, P25=135) show a significant rebound (+237%), breaking the downward trend of late July. The high volatility (std dev remains high relative to mean) requires us to maintain a buffer. Demand in August 2019 generally starts recovering from deep summer lows towards Autumn levels. Given the rebound from 40 to 135, relying solely on the P24 low would be dangerous. A short-term average (recent_N=3) captures the mix of the low (40) and the recovery (135), providing a balanced forecast that doesn't overreact to the single low point nor the single high spike of P22. We stick to the default lead time (0 periods) as no delays are observed.

Carry-over insight: August recovery signal: Demand rebounded significantly from 40 (P24) to 135 (P25), ending the steep July decline. Volatility remains the dominant characteristic (range 40-218 in 4 weeks).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (mid-August) marks a critical transition. After the extreme volatility of July (demand ranging [40, 218] with a mean ~113), Period 26 saw a strong rebound to 196 units, causing a stockout. This rebound (40 -> 135 -> 196) suggests the 'Summer Slump' is ending and demand is returning to the Spring/Early Summer baseline of ~200+. Currently, on-hand is 0. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistent in history), we need to cover the immediate period's demand. Given the abrupt upward shift (40->135->196), a lagging average (even recent_N) will underestimate the recovery. The most recent demand (196) is the strongest signal of the new regime. I will use 'explicit' forecasting for mu_hat based on the last period's signal (196) plus a Buffer for continued recovery momentum (target ~210). For sigma_hat, the volatility remains extreme (std dev of last 5 periods ~70), so a robust safety stock is needed.

Carry-over insight: August recovery confirmed: Demand surged 40->135->196 (P24-P26), indicating a definitive end to the July slump and a return to ~200 unit levels. Volatility remains high.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
August demand has stabilized at ~197 units (P26: 196, P27: 197), ending the July volatility. We select mu_hat using recent_N=2 to track this specific high-volume plateau immediately, discarding the ramp-up values. We maintain a broader sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the recent extreme variance (40-197 range) and ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: August stabilization confirmed: Demand in P26-P27 held steady at ~197 units, establishing a new reliable baseline after the July volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 2. Following the August recovery, demand has shown a softening trend over the last 3 periods (196 -> 197 -> 173 -> 150), bringing the recent average down from the ~190 plateau. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. I am using a short N=4 moving average for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration while discarding the volatile ramp-up data from early August. This responsive setting (N=4) balances the risk of further decline against the high cost of stockouts if demand reverts to the 200-level baseline.

Carry-over insight: Late August softening observed: Demand decreased consecutively (197->173->150) from P27-P29, suggesting the August plateau (~190) is tapering off as Autumn approaches.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) marks the transition to early autumn. Demand in Period 30 rebounded to 172 units after a dip to 150 in Period 29, contradicting the fear of a steep continuous decline. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show a relatively stable regime averaging ~177 units with reduced volatility compared to July. I am selecting recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this post-summer stabilization window (range 150-197) while smoothing out the single low point in P29. This sets a base stock that covers the expected ~175 unit demand plus a safety buffer for minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: September stabilization: Demand rebounded to 172 in P30 after dipping to 150, suggesting a stable early-autumn range [150, 197] averaging ~175 units, rather than a continued seasonal decline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Compelling September demand spike witnessed in Period 31 (231 units, +34% vs previous period), disrupting the August plateau of ~175 units. This likely signals the onset of Autumn seasonality for sneaker socks. Current On-Hand is 0 with a stockout in P31, and the cost of lost sales ($4) significantly outweighs holding costs ($1). Using a simple recent average (N=3 mean is ~184) would likely result in continued stockouts if the new level of ~230 persists. Therefore, using 'explicit' mu_hat of 220 to bridge the gap between the historical average and the new seasonal signal, combined with recent_N sigma to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: September Demand Spike: P31 demand (231) broke the August plateau (~175), confirming a seasonal upward shift consistent with early-Autumn retail patterns.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 34 (2019-09-30). Status: Autumn demand spike confirmed. In Period 33, demand surged unexpectedly to 369 units, causing a stockout. This spike significantly breaks the prior stable range of ~170-230. The last 3 periods (P31-P33) show demand of 231, 210, 369, averaging 270 units. This mirrors the Spring peak levels observed in May (approx 300 units). Given the clear upward trend into October (Autumn/Winter seasonality for socks) and the severe under-forecasting in P33, we must rapidly adjust the mean upwards. I will use a short-term recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this new elevated level (avg ~270) immediately, rather than letting the quieter August data drag down the forecast. Sigma will also be set to recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility (range 210-369). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn surge confirmed: Period 33 demand spiked to 369, far exceeding the prior Sep avg (~210). This signals a major seasonal shift into high-volume Autumn/Winter sales, similar to the Spring peak.

LLM Rationale:
Autumn high-demand regime confirmed by P31-P34 average of ~265 units, a significant step up from August levels. P33 spike (369) and P34 (249) indicate a volatile but high baseline. Setting N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to strictly follow this new regime and exclude the lower pre-September data. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime confirmed: Demand consistently averaged ~265 units from P31-P34 (range 210-369), establishing a high-volume Fall season distinct from the Summer slump.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 14 (Period 36). Demand in Period 35 dropped to 185, significantly lower than the Period 33 peak (369) and Period 34 (249), indicating that the Autumn season is characterized by high volatility (range [185, 369]) rather than a stable high plateau. To manage this wide variance while maintaining service levels for potential spikes, I am using a 5-period window (P31-P35) for both mean (~249 units) and volatility estimation. This smooths the extreme spike and the recent dip, providing a robust base stock that protects against stockouts without overreacting to the single low observation in P35. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility confirmed: Demand dropped to 185 in P35 after peaking at 369 in P33, disproving the stable high regime hypothesis. The season is characterized by extreme range [185, 369] and an average of ~250 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Demand has shown a distinct steady decline over the last three periods (369 -> 249 -> 185 -> 145), suggesting the September 'Back to School' / Early Autumn peak has concluded and the product (sneaker socks) is entering a lower-volume season as colder weather approaches. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are significant ($1 vs $4 profit), the policy shifts to a shorter-term average (N=3) for mu_hat (approx 193) to follow the downward trend. However, due to recent extreme volatility (range 145-369 in 4 weeks), sigma_hat uses N=4 to retain enough safety stock (~96 stdev) against potential random spikes or floor stabilization. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn cooling confirmed: Demand steadily declined from a peak of 369 (P33) to 145 (P36), signaling the end of the high-volume early autumn window. Volume has reverted to pre-September baseline levels (~145-185), likely due to seasonal transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $679.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 corresponds to late October (2019/10/28). Demand in Period 37 rebounded slightly to 191 units after a dip to 145 in Period 36. This suggests that while we are off the peak Autumn highs (369 in P33), the 'cooling' is not a straight line to zero and demand remains robust (avg ~173 over P35-P37). 

Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 85 units, and with P37 demand at 191, we are at risk of stocking out if we don't replenish aggressively enough against the volatility. 

The recent demand pattern (P33-P37: 369, 249, 185, 145, 191) shows high volatility. A simple average of the last 3 periods (185, 145, 191) gives ~173. A 5-period average (including the 369 spike) is ~227, which might be too high given the seasonal downtrend for 'sneaker socks' (typically a warmer weather item) as we approach November. However, the recent bump to 191 suggests not cutting too deep too fast.

I will use a recent_N=3 average for mu_hat (approx 174) to capture the lower post-peak baseline while reacting to the P37 stabilization. I will keep sigma_hat sensitive (recent_N=5) to account for the residual volatility from the Autumn spike.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn Baseline: Demand stabilized near ~190 units in late October (P37), halting the steep decline observed in P35-P36. Volatility remains relevant.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) marks the transition into the pre-holiday retail window. Demand has stabilized over the last two periods (P37: 191, P38: 181), suggesting a solid 'Late Autumn' baseline of ~185 units following the volatility of September/October. I am using a 5-period average for mu_hat (approx 190 units) to capture this baseline while retaining the signal from Period 34's higher volume, effectively smoothing the Period 36 dip. For sigma_hat, I am using a longer 10-period window to explicitly include the extreme spikes from September (e.g., P33's 369 units), ensuring the safety stock buffer is sufficient to cover sudden seasonal or holiday-driven demand surges. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn Stability confirmed: Demand variability has decreased significantly in P37-P38 (191, 181), solidifying a pre-holiday baseline of ~185 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $274.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 demand dropped sharply to 104 (from ~185 baseline in Oct). This aligns with pre-game historical data showing Jan/Feb demand ~95-120, suggesting 'Sneaker Socks' have low seasonality in winter. We are shifting from Autumn levels to Winter lows. I am setting mu_hat with recent_N=3 to rapidly adjust to this downward trend (avg ~159) while allowing for noise. Sigma uses N=5 to capture the volatility of the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonality onset: Demand dropped to 104 in P39, consistent with pre-game historical lows (Jan/Feb ~95-120) for sneaker socks. The Oct stability period (~185) has ended.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18) confirms the Winter seasonality shift identified in the previous period. Demand in Period 40 (120 units) aligns closely with Period 39 (104 units) and historical Jan/Feb lows (~115 units), reflecting reduced usage of 'sneaker socks' in colder weather. However, with the holiday shopping season (Black Friday) approaching, an aggressive reduction to the recent 2-period average (~112) carries risk if gifting drives a spike. I am selecting N=3 for demand and volatility to bridge the transition; this keeps the forecast (~135) slightly elevated above current actuals (112) and maintains a higher volatility estimate (due to the drop from 181 in P38), providing a safety buffer for potential retail events while acknowledging the predominant seasonal low.

Carry-over insight: Winter Low regime confirmed: Demand P39-P40 averaged ~112 units, stabilizing after the Autumn drop. This matches early 2019 pre-season data.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (late November) confirms the 'Winter Low' regime identified in Period 41. Recent demand (P39: 104, P40: 120, P41: 107) averages ~110 units, which is consistent with the pre-season historical data for early 2019 (Jan/Feb). This drop likely reflects the reduced utility of hidden 'sneaker socks' in colder weather. Given the stable but low demand, I will switch to a recent_N=3 average to closely track this new baseline without reacting to older Autumn volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter Low regime sustained: Demand P39-P41 averaged ~110 units with low variance, confirming the shift away from Autumn volumes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 demand tripled to 311 units (up from ~110 avg), confirming the onset of the December Holiday shopping season (Black Friday week). This sharp regime shift caused an immediate stockout. Standard averages (N=3 or N=5) will critically lag this new trend (~179 vs 311). Switched to explicit high forecast (mean=320) and high volatility (sigma=100) to ensure effective inventory coverage for the lucrative December window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Season Onset: Demand tripled in Period 42 (107->311), confirming the start of the December high-volume retail period. Immediate regime shift from Winter Low to Holiday Peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 corresponds to Dec 9. We observed a significant volatility event: Period 42 spiked to 311 (likely Black Friday) followed by a sharp reversion to the winter baseline of 107 in Period 43. This reversion suggests the 'Winter Low' regime (~110 units) is the dominant underlying trend, interspersed with holiday spikes. The reaction to the P42 spike caused a large order, leaving us with 298 units on hand. This inventory level is sufficient to cover another isolated holiday spike or nearly 3 weeks of baseline demand. We use recent_N=5 to incorporate both the spike and the baseline into the forecast, but expected base stock will likely be below current inventory, naturally curbing orders to burn off excess.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Volatility confirmed: Demand heavily spiked in Period 42 (311 units) likely due to Black Friday, but immediately reverted to the ~110 unit Winter baseline in Period 43 (107 units). This indicates event-driven volatility rather than a sustained volume shift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 45 corresponds to Dec 16th, a peak holiday shopping week. However, the observed demand trend is weak: Period 44 dropped to 88 units, reinforcing the 'Winter Low' regime identified in Periods 39-41 (avg ~110). The Black Friday spike in Period 42 (311 units) was an isolated even, not a regime shift. Despite the low recent demand, the risk of a Christmas gifting spike remains. We utilize N=5 for estimation, which incorporates the P42 spike into the mean (~146) and standard deviation. This naturally inflates the safety stock to buffer against holiday uncertainty while respecting the prevailing low-demand baseline. With 210 units on-hand, this conservative parameterization likely prevents over-ordering unless the safety stock calculation significantly exceeds current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Winter Low regime deepens: Period 44 demand (88 units) dipped below the early winter baseline (~110), confirming that despite the holiday season, the structural demand for this SKU is at its annual minimum, barring single-week event spikes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). Historical data suggests demand for this SKU follows a 'Winter Low' regime (~100-110 units) interspersed with extreme holiday spikes. We observed a massive Black Friday spike in Period 42 (311 units), followed by a reversion to the baseline (107, 88, 103 units in P43-P45). Given the date (Dec 23), we may see one final holiday gift-buying push or post-holiday clearance traffic, but the core signal is the low winter baseline. However, holding costs are low ($1) relative to profit ($4), so protecting against a stockout is cheap. We will use a short-range average (N=3) to capture the current stable baseline (~99 units) while acknowledging the high variance from recent history. Pipeline is clear (0 in-transit). Lead time remains reliably 0. We proceed with recent_N to reflect the immediate Winter Low reality.

Carry-over insight: Winter Low regime sustained: Demand P43-P45 averaged ~99 units, confirming that outside of Black Friday, the underlying seasonal volume is low.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
160442007: ordered=0, arrived=0, starting on-hand inventory=122, demand=139, sold=122, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $488.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 experienced a stockout (demand 139 vs inventory 122), indicating that the strict 'Winter Low' forecast (~99 units) was insufficient for the final holiday shopping week. With on-hand inventory now at 0, immediate replenishment is critical. We use recent_N=4 to calculate parameters; this window spans Periods 43-46, averaging ~109 units. This approach captures the recent holiday tail volatility (P46's 139) while rightfully excluding the massive Period 42 Black Friday outlier (311), aligning well with the historical Jan 2019 baseline of ~114 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday tail volatility confirmed: Period 46 spiked to 139 units (vs 103 prior), causing a stockout and breaking the strict 'Winter Low' (~100 unit) pattern. Demand remains volatile through year-end.
