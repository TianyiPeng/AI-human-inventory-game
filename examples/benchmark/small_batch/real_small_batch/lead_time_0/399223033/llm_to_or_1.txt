Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial setup. The product is 'Jeggings H.W' (Ladies Denim). Historical demand shows dates in Jan/Feb 2019 with an average around 130 units (range 113-161). The most recent observation (Feb 4) was a high of 161. Since this is the first period, I will use a robust estimator combining all available history (5 data points) to set the initial base stock. Lead time is promised at 0 periods; I will stick to 'default' until I observe actual arrivals. There are no pending orders (Pipeline=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the local variability shown in the history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 2 (Feb 18, 2019). The product is 'Jeggings H.W' (Ladies Denim), showing high demand in early Spring (Feb). In Period 1, we ordered 146 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 186, resulting in a stockout (sold 146, lost 40 sales). The current on-hand is 0. 

Demand history:
- Pre-game samples (Jan/Feb): 126, 120, 128, 113, 161.
- Period 1 actual: 186.

Analysis:
1. Demand Trend: The last two observations (161, 186) indicate a significant upward shift compared to the January average (~122). This suggests a seasonal pickup for denim/spring fashion. I will focus on these recent high values.
2. Lead Time: Promised is 0. Period 1 confirmed actual lead time is 0 (immediate arrival). I will stick to the default (0 periods) for now.
3. Parameter Selection:
   - L: Default (promised 0).
   - Mu_hat: The recent demand is much higher than the long-term average. Using 'recent_N' with N=2 (161, 186) captures this spike better than a longer average. Mean(161, 186) = 173.5. (1+L)*173.5 = 173.5.
   - Sigma_hat: Volatility is increasing. StdDev(161, 186) is approx 17.7. I will use recent_N with N=2 to reflect the current high variance regime.

Strategy: Increase base stock significantly to capture the demand surge (186 in P1) and avoid further stockouts, given the high service level target (critical ratio 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected: Period 1 demand (186) and pre-game P5 (161) significantly exceed Jan average (~122), suggesting seasonal start.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/2/25. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (promised matches actual). Demand analysis shows a 'February regime' starting around P0 (161), P1 (186), and P2 (134). While P2 demand (134) dropped significantly from the P1 peak, the average of these three periods (~160) is still well above the January baseline (~122). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we maintain a higher forecast using recent_N=3 to capture this elevated Feb mean and the increased volatility (sigma) observed in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Feb demand volatility increased: P2 (134) dropped 28% from P1 peak (186) but remains above Jan average (~122), confirming a volatile Spring regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (March 4). Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders 1-3 all arrived same-period), so default L=0 is retained. Demand pattern shows a significant spike in mid-Feb (161, 186) followed by a sharp decline (134, 111) back towards January averages (~122). Given the high Critical Ratio (0.8) favoring service, avoiding stockouts is prioritized despite the downward trend. We select recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full volatility of the last month (including the high peaks and recent lows), producing a mean ~148 that buffers against a potential rebound while respecting the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend continued: P3 (111) follows P2 (134) and P1 (186), indicating a return to Jan baseline levels (~122) after the mid-Feb spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (March 11). Demand has shown a consistent downward trend for 3 consecutive periods (134 -> 111 -> 94), falling below the pre-game January average of ~122. The sharp peak in mid-Feb (186) appears to be a seasonal outlier that is no longer relevant. To avoid overstocking based on that peak, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mean and volatility, which yields a forecast closer to 113 rather than the long-term average of ~130. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods (same-day arrival observed consistently). Current inventory is 82; the parameters aim to top up to a safer level (~130) without over-committing to a declining trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend continued: P4 demand (94) dropped below the Jan baseline (~122) and P3 (111), confirming the end of the Feb seasonal volatility and establishing a lower post-seasonal regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand continues a consistent downward trend (Period 3: 111 -> Period 4: 94 -> Period 5: 82), now falling significantly below the pre-season January baseline (~122). With lead time consistently observed at 0 periods, the system is responsive. To avoid overstocking in this declining regime given the high holding cost ratio (1:4), we switch to a short-memory forecast 'recent_N=3' (approx mean 95.7). This adapts quickly to the dropping demand while maintaining enough safety stock (based on recent volatility) to prevent stockouts if the decline stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal decline deepening: Period 5 demand (82) is the lowest recorded, well below Jan average, confirming an extended low-demand trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $377.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand (97) increased vs P5 (82), halting the consistent decline observed since Period 2. This suggests demand is stabilizing in the 90-100 unit range rather than continuing to freefall. Given the 0.8 critical ratio (high cost of lost sales), we switch to a short-memory mean (N=3, avg ~91) to reflect the current lower baseline, but maintain a longer-memory volatility (N=5, std ~20) to keep adequate safety stock against potential rebounds. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization detected: Period 6 demand (97) rose 18% vs P5 (82), breaking the previous 4-period downward trend and indicating a floor around 90-100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) follows a massive, unexpected demand spike in Period 7 (258 units), which is nearly triple the prior period (97) and significantly exceeds the previous seasonal high (186). This sharp deviation breaks the stabilizing trend observed in March. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the priority is to recover service levels and buffer against this newly revealed volatility. I am switching to recent_N=3 for both mean and standard deviation to incorporate the spike into the forecast immediately while still retaining some memory of the lower baseline (82, 97). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shock in Period 7: Demand spiked to 258 (+166% vs P6), shattering previous downward trend and indicating extreme Spring volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $642.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Analysis of the last two periods reveals significant volatility: Period 7 saw a massive spike to 258 (likely a promotion or season start), followed by Period 8 settling at 174. This suggests a new high-demand Spring regime compared to the low March trough (avg ~90). The average of the last 2 periods is (258+174)/2 = 216. Given the high volatility (sigma), we need to protect service levels. The 'recent_N=2' estimator is the most responsive choice to capture this sudden regime shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so L=0 is maintained. The focus is on recovering stock levels (currently 54 units) to meet this elevated Spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Spring regime confirmed: Average demand of last 2 periods (216) is >2x higher than the March low (~90), validating a shift to high-volume Spring sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (April 15) falls in the week before Easter. Demand has shown extreme volatility recently (P7:258 -> P8:174 -> P9:104). The P9 drop appears to be a correction, but given the holiday context and high critical ratio (0.8), risking a stockout is costly. I am switching to N=3 for both mean and volatility estimation. This captures the full recent range (Mean ~179, High Sigma ~77), ensuring the base stock level (approx 305) covers a potential Easter spike similar to P7/P8 while reacting to the P9 drop. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring volatility intensified: Demand oscillates significantly (P7:258 -> P9:104), invalidating a stable high-volume hypothesis. Forecast strategy shifts to short-term (N=3) averaging to manage extreme variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (104, 89) following the extreme spike in P7/P8 (258, 174). While the recent trend suggests a return to the ~90-100 baseline, the extreme variance dictates a conservative approach. We use recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to incorporate the high-demand signals from late March/early April into the safety stock calculation, protecting against another sudden surge given the high critical ratio (0.8). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring volatility confirmed but inconsistent: Demand dropped rapidly in P9-P10 (avg ~96) after P7-P8 surge (avg ~216), suggesting the spike was event-driven rather than a sustained seasonal shift.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (Apr 29) marks the end of April. Following the extreme volatility of late March/early April (P7-P8), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P9-P11 avg 104 units, sigma low). However, P11 (119) shows a slight uptick, and the P7 spike suggests potential end-of-month sensitivity. To balance these factors, I adopt a short-term moving average (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the current lower baseline (~104), but retain a longer window (N=5) for sigma_hat. This longer sigma window incorporates the high variance of P7-P8, increasing safety stock to buffer against potential recurring end-of-month spikes without over-inflating the base order. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand restabilization confirmed: P9-P11 average (104 units) indicates market has settled back to early-March baseline following the P7-P8 volatility spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6). Demand has stabilized significantly over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), averaging ~106 units with low volatility (std dev ~13). This confirms the end of the P7-P8 Spring volatility spike. The current demand levels (119, 111) are slightly above the March lows but well below the peak, suggesting a steady post-seasonal baseline. To avoid overreacting to the P7-P8 outliers, we use a short N=4 window for both demand mean and volatility, ensuring the target inventory reflects the current stable regime rather than past noise. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (May 13). Inventory is critical (2 units) with no incoming pipeline, necessitating immediate replenishment. Demand has stabilized significantly over the last 3 periods (P11-P13: 119, 111, 115), averaging 115 units with very low volatility. This represents a mild recovery from the mid-April dip (P9-P10 avg 96). To capture this current stable operating level without lag, mu_hat uses recent_N=3. However, since N=3 volatility is anomalously low (~4 units), sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (including P9-P10) to ensure a realistic safety buffer against potential fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: May Stability confirmed: P11-P13 demand highly consistent (avg 115, range 111-119), volatility significantly reduced compared to April oscillations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 saw a sharp demand increase to 144 units, causing a stockout despite previously stable demand (~115). To recover service levels and account for potential summer demand initiation, we switch to a 4-period recent average. This captures the stability of early May while incorporating the new upward signal, and allows the increased variance to boost safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand jump detected in Period 14: Demand rose to 144 (+25% vs P11-13 avg), breaking the stable May regime and causing a stockout. Potential summer ramp-up.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (May 27) analysis: Demand in P14 (144) and P15 (128) confirms a shift to a higher volume regime (avg 136) compared to the stable April/early-May baseline (~115). While P15 dipped slightly from the P14 peak, it remains well above the previous average, suggesting sustained seasonality or trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent uplift without overacting to the single peak in P14, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_3 average (approx 129). Sigma_hat uses recent_5 to account for the volatility introduced by the transition in P14.

Carry-over insight: Mid-May demand shift confirmed: P14-P15 avg (136) is +18% over April baseline (~115), suggesting sustained higher volume.

[REGEX FALLBACK] Extracted: L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to early June. Observations from periods 14-16 (144, 128, 132) confirm a sustained step-up in demand averaging ~135 units, significantly higher than the early May baseline of ~115. This suggests a seasonal shift into Summer or 'payday' activity. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high profitability (CR=0.8), the strategy prioritizes service level. 

Parameters: 
1. Lead Time: 'default' (0) aligns with 100% of observations. 
2. Mean (mu_hat): 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the current active regime (~135 units) without dragging anchor to the lower early-May demand. 
3. Volatility (sigma_hat): 'recent_N' with N=5 is chosen. While N=3 for mean tracks the level, N=5 for volatility (approx StdDev 12) incorporates the transition/jump from P13 to P14, proving a slightly larger safety buffer against noise than the very stable N=3 window would suggest. Using a longer window (e.g., N=10) would incorrectly incorporate extreme March volatility (P7=258) which appears irrelevant to the current stable Summer regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand collapsed to 66 units (down ~50% from the ~135 unit May average). Given the product (Jeggings/Heavy Denim) and the date (early June), this likely indicates the onset of summer seasonality where demand for long, warm trousers drops significantly. To respond to this downward shift without over-reacting to a single data point, I am using mu_hat=recent_N (N=3), blending the recent low with late-May numbers for a forecast around 109 units. Sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) captures the heightened volatility from this regime change. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonality onset: Period 17 demand dropped to 66 (-50% vs May avg), suggesting reduced demand for heavy denim (Jeggings) as summer begins.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (mid-June) confirms the summer low-demand regime for heavy denim/Jeggings. Demand in P17 (66) and P18 (81) averages ~74 units, a 45% drop from the May average (~136). The product description (Heavy Waist Jeggings) strongly supports decreased utility in summer heat. We set mu_hat using N=2 to rapidly adapt to this lower consumption rate. However, to hedge against potential volatility or a partial rebound (high service level requirement with Profit/Holding ratio of 4.0), we set sigma_hat using N=5, which incorporates the recent regime shift variance into the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Summer low season confirmed: Average demand P17-P18 (~74) dropped ~45% vs May (~136) due to warm weather impact on heavy denim.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24). The summer seasonal decline for 'Heavyweight Jeggings' has intensified. Period 19 demand (44) hits a new historical low, confirming that the high-heat summer months drastically reduce consumption of this SKU. The 3-period average (June) is ~64, compared to the May average of ~136 (-53%). To avoid overstocking during this low-demand season, we rely strictly on short-term history (N=3) for forecasts, discarding irrelevant Spring data. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump deepens: Period 19 demand (44) hit historical low, driving June average (~64) to <50% of May levels, confirming drastic seasonal avoidance of heavy denim.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 corresponds to July 1st, entering peak summer heat. Demand for heavy denim (Jeggings) has continued its steep descend, hitting a new historical low of 29 units in Period 20 (down from ~130s in May). The current regime is a 'Summer Trough'. I am setting N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude early June noise (81 units) and focus on the deep summer baseline (avg of last 3 is ~51 units), ensuring inventory levels drop to match reduced sales velocity and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough deepens: P20 demand (29) hits new historical low, confirming continuing decline for heavy denim usage in July heat.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8th). Demand remains in a deep summer trough, with Period 21 demand of 34 units confirming the low-volume regime established in Period 20 (29 units). Heavy denim sales are historically minimized during peak summer heat. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~36 units, significantly below the spring/May levels. I am switching to a short-term moving average (N=3) for both demand and volatility to accurately calibrate inventory to this stable low-demand season without overstocking based on irrelevant older data. On-hand inventory (40) is nearly sufficient for expected mean demand, likely resulting in a minimal top-up order. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough stabilized: Demand consistently minimal (avg ~36 units over P19-P21) confirming deep July seasonal avoidance of heavy denim.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 represents mid-July, typically the nadir for heavy denim demand. Demand in Period 22 (38 units) confirmed the 'summer trough' regime established in P20-P21 (avg ~32 units). The market has stabilized at this low volume (approx 30-40 units/week) due to continued seasonal avoidance. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to strictly adhere to this July baseline and exclude the irrelevant higher demand from May/June. Observations confirm lead time remains 0. Current inventory (5 units) is critically low against expected demand (~38), so replenishment will immediately trigger to cover the period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22. Demand has clearly bottomed out in late June (P20: 29 units) and is now showing a consistent recovery trend (P21: 34 -> P22: 38 -> P23: 52). The jump to 52 caused a stockout in Period 23, confirming the Summer trough is ending as retail potentially shifts toward 'Back-to-School' or early Fall merchandising for heavy denim. To address the upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I am switching to an explicit forecast slightly above the last realization (55) rather than using a lagging average. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed bottomed in late June (Period 20, 29 units). July shows a dedicated recovery trend (P21-P23: 34->38->52), signaling the transition to pre-Fall/Autumn demand levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29 (Period 25). The product (Heavy Jeggings) is in a summer trough but showing signs of stabilization. Demand in July (P21-P24) has averaged ~40 units, recovering from the June low of 29. While P23 spiked to 52 causing a stockout, P24 dropped back to 35, suggesting the recovery is volatile rather than linear. We use recent_N=4 to capture this specific July regime (avg ~40) without anchoring to the deeper June lows. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer recovery volatility: The linear recovery trend observed in early July broke in Period 24 (35 units, down from 52), characterizing late July as a volatile stabilization phase (avg ~40 units) rather than a steep ascent.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (August 5) marks the transition from Summer to the Pre-Fall/Back-to-School season, a historically stronger period for denim/jeggings. The deep summer trough (June lows ~29 units) has passed. Recent demand (Periods 22-25: 38, 52, 35, 43) establishes a new, higher baseline averaging ~42 units with moderate volatility. To capture this recovery without being dragged down by obsolete June data, we switch to a short-term N=4 moving average for both demand and volatility. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Fall recovery established: July/Aug demand (avg ~42 in P22-P25) has consistently lifted off the June floor (29), confirming the end of the deep summer trough and the start of an upward seasonal transition.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 represents mid-August (Pre-Fall/Back-to-School season). The recovery trend identified in previous periods has accelerated, with Period 26 demand reaching 51 units\u2014a return to the highs seen in mid-July (P23: 52) and a significant increase from the late June low (29). The upward trend is clear (Last 3 periods: 35 -> 43 -> 51). A stockout occurred in Period 26 (demand 51, sold 49), indicating that the previous parameters were slightly too conservative for the velocity of the recovery. To correct this and prevent further lost sales during this seasonal ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using `recent_N` with N=4. This window captures the two recent highs (52 and 51) while accounting for the volatility (35), producing a higher weighted safety stock than a shorter or longer average would. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Fall ascent accelerating: Period 26 demand (51) confirmed the upward trajectory, matching the July peak and causing a stockout. Demand has risen consecutively for 3 periods (35->43->51), signalling the need for aggressive parameterized responsiveness to match seasonal velocity.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (Aug 19) is deep into the Pre-Fall/Back-to-School retail window, a prime season for heavy denim (Jeggings). Period 27 confirmed a massive acceleration in demand (73 units, +43% vs P26), which outpaced the previous order and resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand ascent is non-linear (P25:43 -> P26:51 -> P27:73). Traditional averaging (recent_N) lags significantly behind this velocity (avg of last 3 ~56). To address the stockout and anticipate the continued seasonal surge, we switch 'mu_hat' to an explicit forecast of 85 (projecting the recent trend forward). 'sigma_hat' uses recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of this ascent phase.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Fall acceleration intensity confirmed: Period 27 demand (73) is >2x the summer trough (29) and jumped 43% vs P26, causing a stockout. The transition to high-volume Autumn sales is accelerating faster than linear trends, requiring aggressive explicit forecasting.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) confirms the rapid acceleration into the Autumn season for heavy denim/jeggings. Demand has risen consecutively for 6 periods (35 -> 43 -> 51 -> 73 -> 79). Although P28 (79) shows a slight deceleration in the growth rate compared to the P26-P27 jump, the upward trend is robust and clearly established. The summer trough (<40 units) is over. We are now in a pre-Fall ramp-up. Given the consecutive stockouts in P26 and P27, and the consistent growth, reliance on backward-looking averages (even short N) lags behind the trend. To maintain service levels during this aggressive ramp-up, I will use an explicit forecast that projects the current growth trajectory forward. A conservative projection suggests demand will likely reach ~90-95 units in Period 29. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 95 to stay ahead of the curve. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up sustained: Demand has increased for 6 consecutive periods (P24:35 -> P28:79), confirming a strong, sustained transition out of the summer trough.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (Sep 2) marks the start of the heavy denim peak season (Autumn/Winter). Demand in Period 29 (100) surged 26% vs Period 28 (79), breaking the prior linear recovery trend and confirming aggressive seasonal acceleration. Given the high stockout cost ($4 vs $1 holding) and the upward velocity (P27:73->P28:79->P29:100), relying on trailing averages would likely result in stocked-out periods. I am setting an explicit forecast of 125 (projecting the recent +21 unit growth) to anticipate the ramp-up. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to capture the volatility inherent in this trend change.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand acceleration: Period 29 demand (100) jumped +26% vs P28 (79), confirming a sharp non-linear ramp-up entering September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) confirms the Autumn/Winter seasonal ramp-up is accelerating aggressively for heavy denim. Demand in Period 30 (129) jumped 29% over Period 29 (100), continuing an 8-period unbroken streak of increases from the summer low of 29. The current inventory is critically low (8 units) following a near-stockout. With profit ($4) significantly outweighing holding costs ($1), and a clear linear-to-exponential growth trend (~+30 units/period recently), forecasting simply based on history will lead to lost sales. I am using an explicit forecast of 165 (projecting the recent +30 unit acceleration forward from the last observation of 129) to stay ahead of the curve. Sigma is set to recent_5 to capture the volatility inherent in this rapid ascent.

Carry-over insight: Autumn surge intensifies: Period 30 demand (129) rose 29% vs Period 29, marking 8 consecutive weeks of growth (from 29 to 129 units). The rapid acceleration (~30 units/week) signals an imminent return to peak Winter volumes (>160).

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Sep 16). The 8-period continuous growth trend in demand ended in Period 31, with sales dropping to 102 units (-21% vs P30's 129). Despite the dip, demand remains robustly in the Autumn high-volume regime (>100 units), significantly above summer lows. The observation suggests a transition from rapid acceleration to a volatile, high-demand plateau typical of the season. To maintain high service levels for this profitable item without over-reacting to the single P31 dip or the P30 spike, we employ a short N=3 average for both mean and volatility. This estimates demand around 110 units, ensuring the current low inventory (88 units) is replenished immediately to cover expected Autumn variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn growth streak broken: Period 31 demand (102) dropped 21% vs Period 30 peak (129), ending the 8-period continuous upward trend. Demand appears to have stabilized in a high-volume Autumn band (~100-130 units) rather than continuing exponential growth.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (late Sept) is deep in the Autumn season. P32 demand (125) confirms that the P31 dip (102) was normal volatility within a high-volume plateau (range 100-130), rather than a downward trend. Comparison to Jan 2019 data (avg ~123) suggests we have returned to peak denim season levels. Since we stocked out in P32 (ending inventory 0), it is critical to maintain service levels. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-volume oscillations (avg ~119) without diluting the forecast with lower August data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume plateau confirmed: P32 demand (125) validates a sustained high-demand regime (oscillating 100-130 units), matching early-year winter peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sep 30) follows a massive demand shock in Period 33 where demand doubled to 266 units (+112% vs P32), resulting in a stockout. This surge mirrors the Spring peak (Period 7: 258 units) and signals the onset of high-volatility Winter seasonality for heavy Jeggings. The previous stable Autumn plateau (100-130 units) is invalid. Given the high cost of lost sales (ratio 0.8), we switch to responsive parameters (N=3) to capture this new elevated mean (~164) and high variance (~88), ensuring the base stock protects against another surge while acknowledging the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter volatility onset confirmed: Period 33 demand spiked to 266 (+112% vs P32), shattering the stable Autumn plateau. This resembles the Spring peak (P7) and mandates a high-variance, high-service inventory strategy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 corresponds to early October, continuing the transition into the peak Autumn/Winter season for heavy denim. Demand in Period 34 (143 units) settled lower than the Period 33 spike (266) but remains significantly elevated compared to the September average (~115), confirming a new, higher baseline regime. The current on-hand inventory of 97 units is insufficient to cover the new baseline demand of ~143 units, creating a high stockout risk if another volatility spike occurs. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), the strategy prioritizes availability. I am selecting 'recent_N=3' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to explicitly capture the high-volatility cluster of the last three periods (125, 266, 143), yielding a robust base stock that defends against both the higher average demand and the demonstrated variances seen in P33. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline shift confirmed: Following the P33 spike (266), Period 34 demand settled at 143, which is the highest non-spike value since February. This confirms a sustained shift to a high-volume Winter regime (>140 units/week) for October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (mid-October) reinforces the high-volume Autumn regime. While demand softened slightly to 125 in Period 35, the 5-week average remains robust (~152 units) due to the Period 33 spike (266). The current demand band (125-145 units) suggests a strong baseline typical of cold-weather apparel. We utilize 'recent_N=5' for both mean and volatility to capture this high-variance, high-demand period, ensuring the inventory target (~206 units) sufficient safety stock against another potential spike while covering the reliable baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn plateau refinement: Following the P33 spike (266), demand has settled into a 125-145 unit band (P34:143, P35:125), confirming a consistent high-volume baseline significantly above the summer trough but stabilizing below the extreme outlier peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21). Demand in Period 36 unexpectedly dropped to 81, contrasting with the high-volume Autumn trend (avg ~135 for P30-P35). Despite this dip, the season (late Oct) strongly favors heavy denim. Using N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~148) smooths the extreme volatility (P33 spike 266 vs P36 dip 81) to maintain a buffer for winter demand. Sigma_hat N=5 captures the high recent variance to ensure safety stock covers potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: October volatility confirmed: Period 36 drop to 81 (-35%) indicates Autumn demand is not a stable plateau but oscillates significantly (range 81-266), requiring volatility-aware parameterization.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (Oct 28). We are deep in the Autumn/Winter transition for regular jeggings. Period 37 demand exploded to 233 units (+188% vs P36), causing a stockout and confirming that the Period 33 spike (266) was not an anomaly but part of a high-volatility recurrent pattern. Demand in the last 5 weeks has oscillated violently between 81 and 266. Given the Profit:Holding ratio of 4:1 ($4 profit vs $1 cost), the optimal policy prioritizes service level to capture these spikes. I am shifting to a N=5 rolling window for both mu and sigma. This window captures the full recent range (P33 and P37 peaks, plus the P36 trough), resulting in a high variance estimate that will drive safety stock up to cover the recurring ~230+ unit demand events.

Carry-over insight: Winter bimodal volatility confirmed: Demand is oscillating violently between moderate weeks (~80-140) and extreme spikes (>230) (seen in P33 and P37), requiring high safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $935.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4): Demand in P37 (233) and P38 (234) confirms a shift to a 'Peak Winter' regime, significantly higher than the P36 dip (81). With nearly 0 inventory (On-hand: 1), the risk of lost sales is critical. I am switching to an explicit forecast matching the recent peak average (~235) to ensure high availability, while using recent volatile history (N=3) for safety stock to buffer against potential drops back to the ~100 level.

Carry-over insight: Winter Peak Regime Confirmed: Periods 37-38 show consecutive demand >230 units, establishing a new 'Peak Winter' baseline significantly higher than the early October turbulence.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Nov 11 (Period 40). We are deep in the pre-holiday season for heavy winter clothing (Jeggings). Context: Demand has established a bimodal 'Winter Peak' regime, oscillating between 'moderate-high' weeks (~125-145 units, e.g., P34, P35, P39) and 'extreme spike' weeks (>230 units, e.g., P33, P37, P38). Recent history (P37: 233, P38: 234, P39: 145) shows this volatility clearly. Strategy: Given the high stockout cost ($4 profit vs $1 holding) and frequency of spikes >230, we must prioritize service level. A short memory (N=3) for mu_hat captures the recent cluster of extreme peaks (averaging ~204 units) better than a longer average which would be diluted by the P36 drop. This maintains a base stock capable of absorbing another potential spike as we approach Black Friday (late Nov). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand oscillation continues: Period 39 (145) dropped from the P37-P38 peaks (>230) but remains robust, confirming a volatile bimodal regime (moderate 125-145 vs. extreme >230) rather than a stable plateau.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (mid-November) precedes the major Black Friday holiday sales. Demand history shows a distinct bimodal oscillation: peaks >230 units (P33, P37-P38) alternated with moderate bands ~125-145 units (P34-35, P39-P40). Following the moderate demand in Period 39 (145) and Period 40 (127), and given the approaching holiday season, the risk of an upward swing is high. With a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), stocking out during a peak is costly. Therefore, we use a short-term N=4 average for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high variance (including the most recent peak cluster P37-P38 and moderate cluster P39-P40), setting a base stock level (~230+) that covers the potential return to high demand while accepting some holding risk if demand remains moderate.

Carry-over insight: Winter oscillation rhythm detected: Demand appears to alternate between 2-week clusters of extreme peaks (>230, P37-38) and moderate baselines (~135, P39-40), suggesting a cyclic volatility pattern rather than random noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date (Nov 25) includes Black Friday, the year's peak retail event; past history (Period 7, 33, 37) proves this SKU is prone to massive volatility spikes (>250 units) during event weeks. Period 41 demand (103) represents a pre-holiday lull. To prevent stockout during the expected Black Friday surge, I am explicitly forecasting demand (mu_hat) at 260 units (matching previous peaks) and using recent_N=5 for sigma to capture the high volatility of the current winter regime. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lull confirmed: Period 41 demand (103) dropped to the lowest level in 6 weeks, interpreted as consumer wait-and-see behavior before Black Friday (Period 42). Expecting immediate reversion to Winter Peak regime (>230 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1248.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) demand exploded to 371 units (Black Friday week), validating the 'pre-holiday lull' theory from Period 41 (103 units). This surge caused a stockout (59 lost sales). We are now in Period 43 (Dec 2), which corresponds to Cyber Monday week. Given the product (Jeggings), online Cyber Monday demand is expected to rival or sustain the Black Friday peak. Standard averages (N=3 or N=5) are heavily weighted down by the P41 dip (103) and P40 baseline (127), resulting in forecasts (~200) that are likely too low for this peak event week. Therefore, I am using an explicit forecast of 300 units to anchor expectation near the confirmed Black Friday levels, prioritizing service level (Profit $4 vs Cost $1) during this critical window. Volatility (sigma) is set to recent_N=5 to capture the extreme variance between the lull and the spike.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge confirmed: Period 42 demand reached a record 371 units (+260% vs P41), validating the pre-holiday dip. Stockout occurred. Cyber Monday (P43) expected to sustain this 'Peak Holiday' regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 corresponds to Dec 9th, deep in the holiday season. The previous period (P43) saw a massive drop in demand to 84 units (-77% vs P42's Black Friday peak of 371), likely due to consumer fatigue/front-loading of purchases in the prior week. We are currently holding 309 units, which serves as a substantial buffer. Given the extreme recent volatility (from 103 -> 371 -> 84), we must use parameters that capture this variance without over-reacting to the single lull in P43. Using recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma incorporates the Black Friday peak, the pre-holiday baseline, and the post-holiday dip, yielding an average demand ~170. This will likely result in a zero order (burning down the high on-hand inventory), which is the prudent move to avoid exiting the season with massive overstock while still covering a potential pre-Christmas rebound.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday 'Hangover' confirmed: Period 43 demand collapsed to 84 units (-77% from P42), contradicting the expectation of a sustained Cyber Monday peak. This establishes a pattern of extreme oscillation (Feast/Famine) rather than a continuous high plateau for the holiday season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final full shopping week before Christmas. Following the extreme Black Friday spike (P42: 371) and the subsequent hangover (P43: 84), Period 44 saw a slight recovery to 108 units. While a return to extreme peaks is uncertain, a pre-holiday lift is historically likely for retail apparel. Given the immense recent volatility, I am using N=5 for both mean and variance. This window includes the BF outlier, significantly inflating the standard deviation to create a larger safety stock buffer (~158 mean, high sigma), protecting against a potential Christmas surge while recognizing the baseline recovery to ~100 units.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Christmas stabilization confirmed: Period 44 demand (108) recovered +28% from the post-Black Friday low (84), indicating a return to moderate winter volumes (~100-110) rather than a continued collapse, setting a baseline for the final holiday week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 demand (205 units) surged +90% compared to Period 44, contradicting the previous stabilization hypothesis and confirming that the holiday season remains in a volatile 'Feast/Famine' regime (P42:371 -> P43:84 -> P44:108 -> P45:205). With the critical ratio favoring service (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), and entering the unpredictable post-Christmas week (Period 46), it is safer to carry excess safety stock than to stock out. We switch to 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mean and sigma to capture the full breadth of the recent high-volatility window (ranging 84-371), ensuring coverage for potential post-holiday sales spikes while bridging the gap to the January baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 45 Pre-Christmas surge: Demand rose to 205 (+90% vs P44), disproving the stabilization theory. December remains highly volatile with alternating peaks and troughs (371 -> 84 -> 108 -> 205), requiring wider forecasting windows (N=4) to buffer against erratic swings.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 represents the post-Christmas week (New Year). Period 46 demand (142) dropped significantly from the pre-Christmas spike (205), confirming the holiday peak has passed. We expect demand to settle back into the standard Winter baseline (~120-140 units) observed in early 2019 and pre-holiday periods. Because December showed extreme volatility (84 to 205), we use a 4-period moving average for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This smooths out the holiday noise (cyber Monday dip, Xmas spike) to produce a robust forecast (~135 units) while maintaining a high safety stock buffer via the high recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas cooling confirmed: Period 46 demand (142) dropped 31% from the P45 peak (205), signaling the end of the holiday rush. Demand is reverting to the standard Winter baseline (~120-140) observed in early 2019.
