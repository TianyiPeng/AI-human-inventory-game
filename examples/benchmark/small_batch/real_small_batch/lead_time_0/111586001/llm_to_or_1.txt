Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Product (Tights) is in-season (Winter/Feb). History shows a demand jump after the first week of Jan (68 to >109). The last 4 weeks are stable with an average of ~116 units. I am excluding the initial week (68) as an outlier/ramp-up to prevent under-forecasting. Setting parameters based on recent 4 weeks. Promised lead time is 0.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 demand (147 units) set a new high, significantly exceeding the previous max of 126 and causing a stockout. This continues a strong upward trend seen since mid-January. With a high critical fractile (0.8) and a stockout position (on-hand 0), we must adapt quickly to this higher demand level. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters (incorporating the recent 114, 116, 147 sequence) to weight recent activity more heavily than the lower early-January data. Lead time was confirmed as 0 in Period 1, so the default setting remains appropriate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (Feb 25). Tights demand is surging in February (116 -> 147 -> 178), causing consecutive stockouts. The upward trend is steep (+31 units/period recently). Using a standard N=3 average (~147) would lag significantly behind the current demand level of 178. Given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, understocking is costly. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 175 (close to the most recent observation) to catch up with the stronger demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (March 4th). Demand for tights remains elevated in the Feb-March window compared to January data. Observed demand for P1-P3 (147, 178, 141) averages ~155, significantly higher than the pre-game average of ~106. Lead time has been consistently 0 (instant arrival). Given the sustained demand shift, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to capture this higher consumption regime without diluting the forecast with older, lower data. Current inventory is 61, so the system will place an order to cover the gap to the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Feb avg (155) is ~46% higher than Jan avg (106) over 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11. Demand in the active game (Feb-Mar) averages ~149 units (observations: 147, 178, 141, 129), which sustains the higher regime compared to Jan pre-game data (~106). Although Period 4 demand (129) dipped, it remains within the variation of the new regime and is significantly above January levels. Actual lead time is consistently 0 (immediate replenishment). I am using recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to base the forecast solely on the observed game history to maintain service levels during this higher demand season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 18th. Demand for tights is showing a clear seasonal cooling trend following the February spike. Consecutive demand observations have declined for 3 periods (141 -> 129 -> 107), with the most recent value returning to pre-spike levels (~106). To adapt to this downward trend without understocking if it stabilizes, we use 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu_hat (avg ~126). We retain 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat (std ~26) to keep a volatility buffer based on the recent high-variance period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalization confirmed: 3-period consistent decline (141->129->107) indicates end of seasonal peak, returning to ~106 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $547.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand (139) rebounded significantly from Period 5 (107), showing that demand has not fully reverted to the January baseline (~106) as previously hypothetized. The 3-period March average is 125, suggesting a 'new normal' that is lower than the February peak but higher than pre-season levels, characterized by high volatility. With Critical Ratio ~0.8 (high cost of stockouts) and critically low inventory (9 units), we broaden the detection window to N=4 (spanning late Feb to now) to capture this volatility and ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: March demand sustaining ~125 avg (P4-P6), refuting prior signal of full return to 106 baseline; volatility remains high (107-139 range).

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1) begins with zero inventory after a significant demand spike in Period 7 (166 units), resulting in lost sales. This spike mirrors the high demand seen in early periods (P2=178) and contradicts the earlier hypothesis of demand normalizing to ~106. The product is 30 denier tights, likely seeing seasonal strength in early Spring/Easter run-up. Given a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), stocking out is costly. Short-term averages (N=3 to N=5) are currently suppressed by the mid-March dip (P5=107), so I will use N=7 (covering the entire observed high-demand season P1-P7) to establish a more robust mean (~144) and variance, ensuring we stock aggressively enough to cover the resurgence in volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime re-confirmed: Period 7 spike (166) pushes seasonal average (P1-P7) to ~144, disproving prior 'normalization' signal; volatility is high (range 107-178).

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8). The demand signal remains noisy: after spiking to 166 in Period 7, demand dropped significantly to 112 in Period 8. This oscillation (129->107->139->166->112) suggests high volatility rather than a clear directional trend or sustained 'high' regime. Using a 5-period moving average (~131 units) smoothes these extremes (ranging from 107 to 166) to provide a stable forecast baseline, while the corresponding recent volatility estimate ensures sufficient safety stock. Lead time consistently remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatility confirmed over trend: P8 drop (112) following P7 spike (166) refutes a sustained high-demand regime, establishing a volatile pattern (range 107-166) with a 5-period average of ~131.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April): Demand in Period 9 was 131, which is exactly the average of the last 5 periods (107, 139, 166, 112, 131). This confirms the 'high volatility' regime centered around ~131 units, identified in previous insights. Despite the spring season (April), demand for tights has not yet shown a significant seasonal decline. With a high critical ratio (0.8), maintaining service is a priority. I will continue to use recent_N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to effectively capture this volatile but sustained demand level (avg ~131) and its variance (std dev ~21.6), ensuring appropriate safety stock. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (April 22) signals a seasonal transition into Spring, correlating with a demand decline for tights. The last three periods (April) have an average demand of ~114, significantly lower than the Feb-March average of ~143. Period 10 recorded 100 units, the lowest since the game began. To avoid overstocking as demand softens, we set `mu_hat` using `recent_N=3` (avg ~114). We keep `sigma_hat` at `recent_N=5` to maintain a safety buffer against the residual volatility (range 100-166) observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline confirmed: April (P8-P10) average demand (~114) is ~20% lower than Feb-March average (~143), aligning with spring warming trend.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date is April 29 (Period 12). Demand in Period 11 (103 units) reinforces the seasonal decline identified in previous insights, keeping the April average (P8-P11) at ~111 units. This is consistently lower than the Feb/Mar peak (~145+). We use recent_N=4 for demand and volatility to strictly target this 'Spring' regime, filtering out winter noise while maintaining enough variance buffer (from Period 9's 131) to prevent stockouts if a minor spike occurs. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6 (Spring). Product is seasonal Tights, which see declining demand as weather warms. Period 12 demand (113) confirms the lower 'Spring' baseline established in April. The 5-period average (P8-P12) is ~112 units, significantly lower than the Feb/Mar peak average of ~143. I am selecting 'recent_N' = 5 for both mean and volatility to align the forecast with this sustained seasonal decline and prevent overstocking as we approach summer. Lead times remain consistent at 0.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: May 13 (Spring). Product: Tights (seasonal, cooler weather apparel). Context: We are well into spring. Historical demand shows a peak in Feb/March (avg ~143) and a confirmed decline in April/May. The last 3 periods (P11-P13) had demands of 103, 113, 124. This averages to ~113. While P13 saw a slight bump to 124, the overall trend since April is lower than the Feb peak. The product is 'tights', which typically sees lower demand as weather warms up towards summer. The volatility remains present (std dev of last 3 is ~10.5). Given the critical ratio of 0.8 (high service level needed), we should maintain coverage, but avoid overstocking as we approach summer. 
Lead Time: All orders P1-P13 arrived same-period (L=0). No evidence of drift. 
Parameters: L=0 (default). mu_hat: Use recent_N=3 (avg ~113) to capture the current spring baseline, filtering out the winter noise. sigma_hat: Use recent_N=5 to capture volatility (range ~100-131 in recent periods) robustly.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand baseline established: April-May average persists at ~113 (P11-P13), significantly below Feb-March peak (~143).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (late May) signals the onset of summer seasonality for tights. Period 14 demand dropped to 83, the lowest level since the pre-game period, significantly below the recent spring average. While demand is trending down due to warmer weather, the periodic volatility (e.g., P13 spike to 124) remains. I will use a short-term moving average (recent_N=5) for the mean forecast (~105) to adapt to the declining trend, while using the full history (default) for sigma to maintain a safety buffer against lingering volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal drop detected: Period 14 demand (83) is the lowest recorded since game start, breaking the spring floor of ~100 and confirming the decline for tights in late May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late May (2019/5/27), and demand for tights is exhibiting a strong seasonal crash consistent with warmer weather. Demand has dropped sequentially from 124 (P13) to 83 (P14) to 58 (P15), a 53% contraction in two weeks. This rapid decline renders longer historical averages obsolete. I am switching to 'recent_N=3' for both mean and volatility to heavily weight this new summer low regime (avg ~88) while maintaining a buffer against noise. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump deepens: Sequence 124(P13)->83(P14)->58(P15) confirms sharp, sustained demand contraction (-53% in 2 weeks) typical of tights in approaching June.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, confirming the onset of the deep summer off-season for tights. Demand has plummeted from 124 (P13) to 25 (P16) in just three weeks. This steep downward trend creates artificially high standard deviation if calculated using recent history (e.g., N=3 would yield sigma ~29 and mu ~55, resulting in a Base Stock ~103 and a wasteful order of ~11 units). Given high on-hand inventory (92 units) relative to the new demand level (25), the priority is to stop ordering and let inventory drain. I interpret the trend as a regime change rather than volatility, so I am using explicit parameters (mu=25, sigma=10) to forcefully lower the base stock below current inventory. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed: Demand hit 25 in early June (P16), a ~90% drop from Spring peaks, establishing a distinct low-volume summer regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) indicates we are deep in the summer low-demand season for tights. Demand in the last two periods (P16: 25, P17: 37) has stabilized at a very low level compared to the spring baseline. The downward trend (83->58->25->37) confirms a sustained summer regime. I am selecting extremely responsive parameters (N=3) to align the forecast with this new low baseline (~40 units) and ignore the irrelevant higher demand from May. With on-hand inventory at 55, coverage is sufficient for the current demand levels, minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed: Demand in P16-P17 (25, 37) indicates the trough has stabilized in the 25-40 unit range, replacing the steep decline phase with a steady low-volume summer regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (June 17) confirms the 'Summer Trough' regime for tights. Demand over the last 3 periods (P16-P18: 25, 37, 29) has stabilized at a low average of ~30.3 units, with low volatility compared to Spring. This contrasts sharply with the transition period (P15=58) and high season (>100). To avoid overstocking during this low-demand summer season, we use a tight recent_N=3 average for both mean and variance, excluding older high-demand data. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24) reinforces the deep summer low-demand regime for tights. The last 4 periods (P16-P19) show consistently low volume (25, 37, 29, 15), averaging ~26.5 units, which is a massive reduction from the spring peak (~143). The most recent period (P19) hit a historic low of 15, confirming the trough is persisting and potentially deepening. To avoid overstocking during this low-sales season while maintaining service for the remaining demand, we switch to 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mean and volatility. This excludes all spring high-volume data, ensuring the base stock target reflects current summer realities (~26 unit average, ~9 unit std dev). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 corresponds to July 1st, deep summer season for tights. Demand has continued to plummet, hitting a historical low of 5 units in Period 20, effectively breaking the previous stability range (25-40) to the downside. The trend is strongly negative (29->15->5 over the last 3 weeks). Given the holding cost ($1) and current on-hand inventory (30 units), which covers ~6 periods of demand at the current rate (5/period), no new order is desirable. I am switching to a highly responsive `recent_N` (N=3) for both mean and variance to ensure the system recognizes the single-digit demand regime immediately and avoids restocking until inventory bleeds down closer to the new low baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer nadir deepened: Late June demand dropped to single digits (5 in P20), breaking the prior 25-40 stability range and indicating minimum yearly volume.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) places us in deep summer, historically the lowest demand season for tights. Demand has stabilized in the single digits (4 units in P21, 5 units in P20), confirming a summer trough. Current on-hand inventory (26 units) is significantly excess relative to this demand rate (~6 weeks coverage). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging ~8 units) to aggressively reflect this low-volume regime and prevent any reordering until inventory aligns with the summer baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough stability confirmed: Early July demand (4 units) reinforces the single-digit baseline established in late June (5 units), indicating a steady 'deep summer' regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (mid-July), historically the deepest part of the summer trough for tights. Demand has remained in the low double-digits or single digits for the last 4 periods (15, 5, 4, 13), confirming a 'deep summer' regime distinct from the earlier transition phase. The slight uptick in P22 (13 units) compared to P21 (4 units) suggests some volatility remains even at the bottom. We set parameters using the last N=4 periods to tightly closely track this low-volume regime while accommodating the minor volatility observed in P22. Promised lead time (0) continues to match actuals.

Carry-over insight: Deep summer volatility: July demand remains low but exhibits fluctuations (range 4-13 units), confirming a volatile trough rather than a stable single-digit baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 is late July. Demand remains in a 'deep summer' trough but has exhibited significant volatility, bouncing from single digits (4-5 units in P20-P21) back to low double digits (13, 12 in P22-P23). Current inventory (2 units) is critically low against the recent demand of ~12. Using recent_N=5 (sequence: 15, 5, 4, 13, 12) captures this high variance (Mean ~9.8, High Sigma). This approach prompts a safety stock buffer that targets a base stock of ~13-14 units (High Sigma compensates for the lower Mean), ensuring service for the recent 12-13 unit demand levels while robustly handling the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility verified: Demand oscillates between single digits (4-5) and low teens (12-15) in July. Late July sustained levels of ~12 units (P22-P23) suggest the seasonal floor has passed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (Late July) represents 'Deep Summer' for tights. Demand in Period 24 dropped back to 5 units, refuting the previous period's signal of stabilization at ~12 units. The current regime (Periods 20-24) is characterized by low volume with high relative volatility, fluctuating between 4 and 13 units (Avg ~7.8). We select 'recent_N' = 5 for both mu and sigma to capture this specific 'Deep Summer' profile, filtering out the higher demand from June. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Deep Summer volatility persists: Period 24 demand (5) contradicts prior stabilization signs, confirming a fluctuating baseline (4-13 units) with a 5-period average of ~8 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 corresponds to early August (2019/8/5). While we are still in the summer season where demand for tights is generally low, Period 25 showed a demand increase to 15 units (up from 5 in P24), causing a stockout (lost 3 sales). This fluctuation suggests the 'deep summer' trough of single-digit demand may be ending as retail begins the slow transition toward autumn. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this potential recovery from the trough while remaining responsive to volatility, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 (capturing the recent upward bump to 15) and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the full volatility of the summer low period). Maximizing availability is prioritized (critical ratio ~0.8) as demand begins to stir.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Late Summer recovery signaled: Demand rebound to 15 units (vs P24's 5) broke the single-digit summer floor and caused a stockout, indicating the deep trough is passing as August begins.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (45 units) tripled the previous period's volume (15 units) and resulted in a stockout, decisively ending the deep summer trough (July avg ~8). This sharp inflection point aligns with the mid-August start of the autumn retail accumulation season for tights. Standard averaging (even small N) would lag this rapid regime shift and cause further stockouts. I am switching to explicit parameters to aggressively chase this ramp-up, forecasting demand at 55 (projecting continued growth) and setting volatility high (25) to buffer the transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Seasonal Ramp confirmed: Period 26 demand (45) tripled Period 25 (15), definitively ending the summer trough and signaling the start of the seasonal climb back towards winter peaks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (Aug 19): The seasonal shift from summer to autumn is accelerating rapidly. Demand has surged from 15 (P25) to 45 (P26) to 79 (P27), causing consecutive stockouts. This trajectory (+34 units/week) mirrors the January 2019 ramp (68->109) provided in the historical samples, indicating a return to the >100 unit baseline is imminent. Standard averages (recent_N) would lag this steep trend significantly. I am setting an explicit forecast of 115 units to match the projected linear growth and prevent further lost sales ($4 profit margin). Sigma set to 35 to buffer the high variance during this transitional ramp.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp accelerating: Period 27 demand (79) increased +75% over Period 26, confirming a rapid return to high-volume season. Trajectory mirrors Jan 2019 pre-game data, suggesting imminent return to 100+ unit levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) confirms the autumn ramp is active, though P28 showed volatility (56 units) after the P27 spike (79 units). The average of the last 3 periods (60) is significantly higher than the summer baseline, confirming the seasonal shift for tights is underway. We use recent_3 for mu and sigma to capture this transition rapidly without being dragged down by early August/July lows or over-indexing on the single peak of 79. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp volatility: Demand levels (45, 79, 56) confirm exit from summer trough but indicate high period-to-period variance during the climb to winter peak levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September 2nd marks the start of the core autumn retail season. Following the initial sharp recovery from summer lows (P26-P27), demand has briefly stabilized in the mid-50s range (P28: 56, P29: 54). However, the spike to 79 in P27 indicates potential for higher volatility and upward momentum typical of the season. To balance the risk of another surge against the current holding cost, I am using a 3-period window. This captures the higher mean (approx 63) and variance from P27, providing a safety buffer (Base Stock ~75) against stockouts, which are 4x more costly than holding inventory.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Plateau confirmed: Demand stabilized in the mid-50s (P28: 56, P29: 54) consecutive weeks after the initial spike (P27: 79), distinct from the ramp-up volatility, suggesting a temporary steady state before further seasonal increases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (147 units) surged almost 3x compared to the prior week (54 units), signaling a decisive break from the 'Autumn Plateau' and a return to the 'Winter Peak' regime observed at the start of the game (Jan/Feb levels ~120-150). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and the clear seasonal signal (September tights), relying on trailing averages would severely under-stock. We switch to explicit parameters based on the new high-demand regime, estimating mean at the most recent signal (147) and variance consistent with the volatile winter history.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Winter Peak regime confirmed. Demand surged to 147 (matching P1 levels), breaking the Aug plateau (~55). Seasonality and history indicate sustained high volume (100-150 range) through the cold season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Mid-September). Demand has exploded vertically, entering a 'super-peak' winter regime significantly higher than the early 2019 data (Jan peaks ~126 vs current 203). Consecutive stockouts confirm we are under-ordering during this massive ramp-up (54 -> 147 -> 203). Standard averages lag the trend too heavily. I am switching to an explicit forecast slightly above the last observed demand (210) to anticipate sustained or growing high volume, paired with a high volatility estimate (recent_N=3, capturing the ramp) to generate substantial safety stock and recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak intensity confirmed: Period 31 demand (203) exceeded early 2019 highs (~126) by >60%, indicating a stronger-than-expected winter regime. Demand has quadrupled in 3 weeks (54->203).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (late Sept) context: We are deep in a 'super-peak' demand regime for tights. Demand has surged from 54 (P29) to 215 (P32), significantly exceeding early 2019 highs. The growth rate slowed in P32 (+6% vs +38% prior), suggesting stabilization above 200 units rather than infinite exponential growth. Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must aggressively target this new level. I am selecting mu_hat based on the last 2 periods (avg ~209) to capture the immediate high volume, ignoring the lower ramp-up period. However, I am setting sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods (std ~36) to incorporate the significant volatility/uncertainty of this recent ascent, ensuring a robust safety stock buffer. Lead times remain consistently 0, tracked tightly.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak saturation: Demand growth slowing (+6% in P32 vs +38% in P31) while sustaining high volume (>200 units). Volatility remains influential as the new high-volume baseline establishes itself.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Hyper-Peak Alert: Demand exploded to 344 units in P33 (+60% WoW), causing a massive stockout. We are at 0 inventory. The seasonal ramp is vertical. To catch up, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the most recent demand level (344) and increasing sigma to 100 to force a high base stock and maximize the order cap.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Hyper-peak explosion: Demand surged to 344 (+60% vs P32), shattering all previous records. The winter peak has evolved into a hyper-demand phase far exceeding Jan 2019 levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Oct 7, Period 35. Context: We are in a confirmed 'hyper-peak' winter regime for tights. Demand in Period 34 (311 units) slightly retreated from the P33 record (344) but remains extremely high (>300), validating the massive step-change from P32 (215). The seasonality suggests this high volume will persist or grow as autumn deepens. Given the rapid recent escalation (200s -> 300s), long-term averages are obsolete. We select 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the transition and the high volatility (values: 215, 344, 311 -> Avg ~290) without over-reacting to a single point. Lead time remains consistently 0 (immediate arrival).

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak sustained: Period 34 demand (311) confirms the new >300 unit baseline established in Period 33, validating a sustained high-volume winter regime despite a slight dip from the record high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1238.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Mid-October). Demand has stabilized at a 'Hyper-peak' level, averaging 324 units over the last 3 periods (P33-P35: 344, 311, 317). This indicates a plateau following the rapid exponential growth of September. While the growth trend has paused, volatility remains a risk given the high volume. 

Strategy:
1. mu_hat: Use 'recent_N' with N=3 (Avg ~324) to tightly track the current plateau level rather than the lower values from the ramp-up phase.
2. sigma_hat: Use 'recent_N' with N=5 (StdDev ~64). This includes the volatile ramp-up data periods (P31-P32), resulting in a larger safety buffer (approx +54 units) compared to looking only at the stable plateau (N=3 would give StdDev ~17). This is prudent to protect against stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) in case of further upward spikes.
3. Lead Time: Default (0 periods) matches consistently observed immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak plateau confirmed: Demand averaged 324 units over P33-P35 (range 311-344), signaling a halt to the rapid vertical growth phase while maintaining record high volumes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Oct 21. Demand remains in the high-volume 'winter peak' regime, though Period 36 (266 units) showed a ~17% dip from the >300 unit plateau observed in Periods 33-35. This suggests high volatility rather than a regime collapse, as tights seasonality typically strengthens in late autumn. Given the high stockout cost ($4 margin vs $1 holding), we maintain an aggressive forecast using the last 4 periods to average out the recent dip while retaining the high-volume signal from late September. Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak volatility: Period 36 demand (266) dipped below the >300 unit baseline established in P33-P35, indicating significant variance (range 266-344) within the high-volume winter regime active in late October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Oct 28 (Period 38). Demand in Period 37 rebounded to 324 units, confirming that Period 36's dip to 266 was a fluctuation within a sustained high-volume 'Hyper-peak' regime rather than a downward trend. The 5-period average (P33-P37) is now ~312 units. With on-hand inventory critically low at 13 units and holding cost ratio favoring service (4:1 profit/hold), we must forecast aggressively. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to isolate this specific high-demand plateau (P33-present) and exclude the lower volume ramp-up data from September, ensuring the base stock level captures the full intensity of the current season.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak baseline solidified: Period 37 demand (324) erased the signal from the Period 36 dip, establishing a robust 5-period average of ~312 units (range 266-344) and confirming sustained winter intensity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) is now in deep autumn/early winter, matching the peak seasonal relevance for tights. Demand has stabilized at a 'hyper-peak' level, with the last 6 periods averaging ~292 units (range 203-344). The most recent period (P38) saw demand of 293, slightly below the peak of ~344 but consistent with the high-volume regime. Volatility remains significant (sigma ~40-50). Given the stable high lead time reliability (0 periods consistently), I will continue using a recent_N average for demand to capture the sustained high volume without overreacting to single-week noise. A window of N=5 captures the core of this hyper-peak regime (avg ~302 units). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak saturation confirmed: Demand has oscillated around ~300 units for 6 weeks (avg 292), indicating the vertical growth phase has ended and a stable high-volume winter plateau is established.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) context: We remain deep in the high-volume winter season for tights. Demand in Period 39 (277) slightly softened but persists within the established 'hyper-peak' plateau range (266-344) observed since Period 33. The 6-period moving average is stable at ~298 units. Given the high cost of lost sales (Critical Ratio 0.8) and reliable 0-period lead time, we maintain the current strategy. We select mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the stable plateau average (~298) and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the full volatility spectrum of this high-demand regime (including the P33 outlier).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1288.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Deep in winter Hyper-peak regime (Nov 18). Period 40 demand (325) caused a stockout, rebounding from P39 (277). The 8-period average (P33-P40) is ~307 units. With Black Friday approaching, demand will likely stay high. Using recent_N=8 for mean and volatility captures this sustained high-volume plateau while smoothing period-to-period noise. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Hyper-peak intensity sustained: Demand rebounded to 325 (vs P39's 277), confirming the ~300 unit baseline is active and volatile, causing a minor stockout.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 corresponds to the week of November 25, 2019, which includes Black Friday (Nov 29). This is traditionally the highest retail demand week of the year. While the recent 'Hyper-peak' baseline has plateaued around 300 units (avg of last 5 is ~302), the specific calendar event warrants an aggressive forecast. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 345 (matching the P33 record high) to capture the expected Black Friday surge and avoid expensive stockouts (Profit/Holding ratio = 4:1). Sigma is derived from the recent 5 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday Week identified: Nov 25 date signals major retail event. Increasing forecast target to match season high (344+) in anticipation of holiday spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1411.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 corresponds to Dec 2, entering the core pre-Christmas shopping window. Demand in Period 42 hit a game-history high of 355 units (Black Friday week), validating the 'Hyper-peak' winter regime. With only 9 units on hand and immediate lead time (L=0), the order placed now must fully cover Period 43's demand. We select mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg ~323) to remain responsive to the upward holiday trend while smoothing the extreme P42 spike slightly. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=10 to reflect the variance demonstrated throughout the entire winter season so far.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Peak intensity confirmed: Period 42 set new record demand (355), surpassing previous highs and confirming Black Friday impact. High volume (>300) regime remains active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $637.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 corresponds to December 9th, deep in the winter retail season. We observed a significant demand contraction in Period 43 (197 units) immediately following the Black Friday peak in Period 42 (355 units). This 45% drop likely represents a 'hangover' or demand pull-forward effect from the promotions. While the 197 figure is well below the recent ~300 baseline (P33-P41), lowering forecasts aggressively is risky given the upcoming Christmas holiday demand. I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for both mean and volatility. This window captures the pre-peak stability (P39-41), the Black Friday spike (P42), and the post-peak dip (P43), resulting in a balanced target of ~289 units with widened safety stock to handle the extreme volatility (Std Dev ~60). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday volatility: Period 43 demand (197) dropped 45% from the Period 42 peak (355), falling below the ~300 unit baseline established in Periods 33-41. This confirms high volatility (range 197-355) operates in December, rather than a monotonic holiday climb.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16): We are deep in the holiday season. Period 44 demand rebounded strongly to 319 units, confirming that the Period 43 drop (197) was a temporary post-Black Friday lull rather than a regime change. The high-volume winter baseline (>300 units) is active. With a stockout cost ratio of 4:1 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we prioritize service level. The recent 5-period average is dragged down to ~297 by the P43 outlier, which risks understocking (as seen in P44 where we ended with only 21 units). Therefore, we use 'explicit' parameters to filter the lull and target the active seasonal baseline of ~330 units, while maintaining a high sigma (60) to account for the observed volatility (197-355 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Pre-Christmas rebound confirmed: Period 44 demand (319) recovered from the post-BF dip (197), validating a sustained >300 unit baseline for the holiday season and dismissing the dip as transient volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents Christmas week. Period 45 demand exploded to an all-time high of 475, causing a stockout. Given the high profit-to-holding ratio (4:1) and the extreme late-season spike, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the recent peak (475) to maximize fill rate. Volatility is extremely high, so sigma is set to 110 to buffer against further upside or erratic drops.

Carry-over insight: Christmas Peak confirmed: Period 45 demand (475) shattered previous Black Friday records (355), establishing the pre-Christmas week as the absolute annual peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (Dec 30) marks the end of the holiday peak. While demand was extreme in P45-P46 (>460), historical patterns and post-event logic suggest a decline towards the standard winter baseline (~300) rather than maintaining holiday peaks. Setting explicit mu_hat=300 to buffer New Year's demand without overstocking for January. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday Super-Peak confirmed: Two consecutive weeks of >460 demand (P45-P46) marks the annual ceiling, roughly 4x the yearly average.
