Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start (2019-02-11). Historical demand (Jan-Feb 2019) is relatively stable with a mean of ~51.2 units and std dev ~6.6 units over 5 samples. Slight upward trend in the last week (59 units). With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, immediate replenishment is critical. Utilizing all available history (N=5) to establish baseline demand and volatility. Using default promised lead time (0 periods) as no delivery data exists yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 Decision for SKU 294008002. 

1. Lead Time: The Period 1 conclude message confirms immediate arrival (ordered P1, arrived P1). The promised lead time is 0. Actual lead time was 0. I will use 'default' (0 periods) as it matches observation.

2. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (Jan-Feb 2019) are: 43, 55, 46, 53, 59. The most recent observation from Period 1 was 66 (demand > supply, sold 57, lost 9). This indicates a potential increasing trend or a high-demand week. The average of provided history is ~51.2. The most recent demand (66) is higher than the historical max (59). This suggests using a recent_N method to capture this upward shift rather than diluting it with older, lower data points. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (approx periods: P1 demand 66, plus history 59, 53) to be responsive.

3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 0. We need to order enough to cover (L+1) periods. Since L=0, we cover just the current period demand.

4. Carry Over: Noting the demand spike to 66 in Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 1 (66 units), exceeding historical max of 59.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (late Feb). Demand has surged significantly (59 -> 66 -> 88), causing consecutive stockouts in Period 1 and 2. This suggests a strong seasonal ramp-up for the short-sleeved item as spring approaches. Lead time remains consistently observed at 0 periods, matching the promised 0. To capture the rapidly rising demand while respecting the minimum sample size constraint (N>=3), I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3. This focuses on the transition period (last historical point + 2 high simulation points) to elevate the base stock target and mitigate further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 2 demand (88) significantly exceeds Period 1 (66) and historical max (59), indicating a sustained upward shift likely due to seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/3/4. We are in Period 4. The last three periods (P1:66, P2:88, P3:70) show a sustained demand regime significantly higher than the pre-game historical average (~51). The average of the last 3 periods is ~75. Empirical lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive same-day), matching the promised lead time. Given the clear regime shift starting in Period 1, I am switching the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to use 'recent_N' with N=3. This focuses the OR parameters on the current high-demand reality rather than diluting the forecast with irrelevant pre-game low demand data. This ensures the base stock level is sufficient for the higher volume observed.

Carry-over insight: New demand baseline established: Average demand over the last 3 periods is ~75 units, confirming a ~47% increase over historical average (51).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11 (Period 5). The product (short-sleeved tee) is in a high-demand spring regime. Observed demand for Periods 1-4 (66, 88, 70, 77) averages ~75.25 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical average of ~51 units. This elevated level is sustained and consistent. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival) as promised. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to fully utilize the relevant in-game data and exclude the lower, outdated winter history. L remains 'default' as execution is perfect.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand remains elevated in the 64-88 range (avg ~73) compared to pre-game history (~51). Lead time consistency is perfect at 0. Using recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full scope of this active Spring season regime while ignoring irrelevant winter pre-game data and setting base stock to cover expected sales plus volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (late March) continues the high-demand spring trend for this jersey top. Last period demand (P6) was 75, consistent with the recent average of ~73 units observed since Period 1. The pre-game historical average (~51) is no longer relevant. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to focus entirely on the active high-demand regime (P1-P6) and exclude irrelevant winter data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1) signifies the active spring season for this short-sleeve tee. Demand reached a new record high of 93 units in Period 7, causing a stockout as inventory was depleted. The average demand over the last 4 periods is ~77 units, significantly above the initial historical average of ~51. Volatility is also high (ranging 64-93 recently). To capture this elevated baseline and variance without overreacting to a single point, we set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4). Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached new all-time high of 93 units in Period 7, reinforcing the strong seasonal spring trend for this SKU.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8th) continues the high spring demand trend for the 'Cora tee'. Demand in Period 8 was 82 units, consistent with the active game average of ~77 units, which remains significantly higher than the pre-game January average of ~51. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods with immediate arrivals. Given the sustained regime shift since Period 1, I use 'recent_N' with N=8 for both demand mean and volatility solely based on the high-demand in-game history, excluding the lower, irrelevant winter pre-game data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (April 15) is mid-Spring. Demand in Period 9 dropped to 56, a significant deviation from the recent high-demand trend (avg ~75 in periods 2-8). While this dip lowers the short-term average, one data point does not confirm a regime change back to pre-season lows. Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit=4 vs Holding=1), we continue to prioritize service level. We use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the current mean (~74) while allowing the increased volatility (range 56-93) to boost safety stock via the sigma parameter. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (April 22). Demand has consistently declined for 3 periods (93->82->56->37), signaling the end of the Spring peak. Current demand (37) is below the pre-season average. Switching logic to recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to quickly adapt to this lower demand regime and prevent overstocking, while managing the high volatility of the transition. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Spring peak ended, demand dropped 60% from peak (93 in P7 to 37 in P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 demand (108) dramatically reversed the downward trend seen in Period 10 (37), marking a new all-time high. This falsifies the previous assumption that the spring season had ended. The SKU is exhibiting extreme volatility (37 to 108 in one week). Given the date (late April), demand is likely high but erratic due to weather or post-holiday shifts. To manage this risk, we switch to a 5-period window (N=5) for both mu and sigma, blending the high demand of P7/P8/P11 with the drops in P9/P10. This yields a robust target inventory (mean ~75, high variance) to prevent stockouts while mitigating the risk of another sharp drop.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: High volatility regime engaged. An all-time high demand of 108 in P11 immediately followed a season-low of 37 in P10, invalidating the 'season end' hypothesis. 5-period average demand is ~75.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6th) indicates peak Spring/Summer season for short-sleeve viscose tops. Demand has surged and sustained high levels (108 in P11, 100 in P12), confirming that the low demand in P10 (37) was an outlier. With a critical ratio of 0.8 ($4 profit / $5 total impact), stockouts are costly ($4/unit lost vs $1/unit held). Current on-hand is 0 following repeated stockouts in peak periods. To maximize service level, we adopt an aggressive forecast: mu_hat uses recent_N=2 to align with the current high variance regime (avg ~104) and sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 (std dev ~30) to broaden safety stock against the demonstrated high volatility (range 37-108). This ensures coverage for the ongoing seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Peak season confirmed active (May): P11-P12 demand average ~104 units overrides P10 outlier; volatility remains high.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13 (Period 14). Demand has stabilized in a high-volume 'summer peak' regime (obs: 108, 100, 91) averaging ~100 units over the last 3 periods. This is noticeably higher than the early season average. The low demand in Period 10 (37) is now confirmed as a distinct outlier (possibly holiday-related) and is excluded from the forecast key. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the priority is maintaining service level during this peak. We select N=3 for both mu and sigma to tightly track the current high-demand plateau while ignoring the older volatility/dips.

Carry-over insight: Peak season regime sustained: Last 3 periods average ~100 units (vs historical avg ~51), confirming robust demand for 'short sleeve' Summer items.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) represents the accelerating phase of the summer season for this Short Sleeve item. Demand in Period 14 hit a new all-time high of 121 units, resulting in a stockout. The sustained high demand regime (average ~105 over last 4 periods) combined with this recent spike indicates increasing seasonal velocity. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for both demand and volatility to weigh the recent high values (100, 91, 121) heavily, ensuring the system adapts to the rising trend and increased variance (std dev ~15). The short history window is justified by the rapid seasonal shift and the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Intensifying peak: Period 14 demand (121) set a new record, 20% above the recent average (100), signaling maximum summer velocity.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (Late May) reflects peak summer demand for this short-sleeve SKU. Demand has accelerated to a new record of 126 units in P15, following 121 in P14. The system has stocked out in 4 of the last 5 periods, indicating that backward-looking averages (mu_hat ~113 for N=3) are lagging the aggressively rising trend. With a high Profit/Holding ratio (4.0), stockout costs vastly outweigh holding risks. Therefore, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast of 130 units to lead the trend and ensure service levels, paired with recent_N=3 for volatility to capture the high variance (91 to 126). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer Peak Acceleration: Demand reached 126 units (new high), requiring explicit forecasts >125 to prevent recurring stockouts (4 in last 5 periods) caused by lagging averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to early June, a high-demand window for this short-sleeve summer item. Period 16 set a new all-time demand record of 140 units, extending a strong growth trend (121 -> 126 -> 140). Trailing averages (last 3 avg = 129) critically lag this velocity, and with only 6 units on hand, relying on them risks a lost sale. I am setting an explicit forecast of 150 to catch up to the trend and buffer against further seasonal acceleration. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak record: Period 16 demand reached 140 units, +11% over previous high. Upward trend necessitates anticipating >140 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) indicates the SKU is in sustained summer peak season. While Period 17 demand (113) dropped from the Period 16 record (140), the 3-period average remains high at ~126 units. The breakdown of the linear upward trend suggests a high-volume plateau rather than a decline. I will use 'recent_N=3' for mu_hat to capture this immediate high-level average (approx 126) and 'recent_N=5' for sigma_hat to include the volatility of the entire ramp-up phase (Periods 13-17), ensuring sufficient safety stock (target ~145) to cover potential recurrences of 140+ demand. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand acceleration paused in early June (Period 17: 113 vs P16: 140), suggesting a transition from growth to a high-volume plateau (~125 units avg). Volatility remains significant.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (June 17) reflects a consolidated summer plateau. After the peak of 140 in Period 16, demand has stabilized at 113 and 118 in the last two periods. This suggests the rapid acceleration phase has ended, settling into a high-volume steady state (~115-125 units). I am using 'recent_N' = 5 (Avg ~124) for demand parameters to capture this active summer regime while smoothing the volatility of the recent peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods with no missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau confirmed: Demand stabilized ~115-120 units (P17-P18) following May peak. Volatility reduced compared to acceleration phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 delivered a massive demand shock (173 units), shattering the previous stability (~115 units) and setting a new all-time high. This represents a +46% week-over-week increase, likely driven by immediate pre-peak summer purchasing (late June). Previous parameter settings resulted in a stockout. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), the strategy shifts to aggressive service level protection. I am setting an explicit forecast of 155 (weighted heavily towards the new high of 173 while smoothing slightly against a one-off outlier) and using a short-term volatility window (N=4) to capture the recent instability. This targets a base stock level capable of absorbing another ~175 unit week.

Carry-over insight: Summer Peak Explosion: Period 19 demand spiked to 173 (new ATH), invalidating the mid-June plateau theory (prev ~115) and indicating extreme seasonal velocity.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (July 1st) represents high summer. The demand history shows extreme volatility: P19 hit an all-time high of 173, immediately followed by a sharp drop to 78 in P20. Despite the drop, the product (short-sleeve tee) remains in season. The drop in P20 might be random noise or a temporary lull after the massive P19 spike. The average of the last 4 periods (P17-P20: 113, 118, 173, 78) is ~120 units. Given the extreme volatility (sigma ~40), reacting too strongly to the low P20 value poses a stockout risk if demand rebounds to P19 levels. I will use a robust explicit forecast closer to the high-season average (~125) to smooth the P20 dip while maintaining protection against another 150+ spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility regime: Demand oscillates violently (173 in P19 -> 78 in P20), requiring inventory buffers (sigma) that account for >50% swings week-to-week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (July 8) suggests a post-peak seasonal correction. Demand has dropped significantly from the Period 19 high (173) to a consistent ~79 units for two consecutive periods (P20, P21). However, the recent volatility is extreme (173 -> 78), and with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the risk of stocking out during a potential demand rebound or secondary spike outweighs the cost of holding excess inventory for one period. Therefore, I am using a short N=3 window. This retains the P19 spike in the calculation, keeping the forecast mean (~110) and variance high enough to generate a safety buffer (Base Stock ~155) against the observed volatility. If the lower demand pattern persists into P22, the high P19 value will drop out of the N=3 window next period, allowing the system to naturally adjust downward to the new baselines.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand drop observed: Demand stabilized at ~79 units for 2 periods (P20-P21) following June peak (173), signaling a -54% correction. Extreme volatility warrants cautious buffering.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15 (Period 23). The summer peak is confirmed over. Demand has dropped consistently from the high of 173 in Period 19 to 78, 79, and most recently 52 in Period 22. This 52-unit demand is the lowest since the pre-season period in April, signaling the end of the high-velocity season for short-sleeve viscose tees. Holding inventory (104 units) currently exceeds the new demand baseline (~70 units). To prevent accumulation of dead stock as the season concludes, I am switching to short-term averages (N=3) for both mean and volatility. This will likely result in a zero order to burn down existing inventory towards the new, lower base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Summer season end confirmed: Demand plummeted from June peak (173) to mid-July low (52), indicating a seasonal cliff. Strategy shifts to inventory burn-down.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (July 22). The summer season is definitively winding down. Demand in Period 23 was 68 units, a slight uptick from P22 (52), but far below the June peak (173). The 3-period average (P21-P23) is roughly 66 units, which is significantly lower than the peak season average (~120). We are confirming a 'Post-Peak' descent. The product is a short-sleeve summer top, and retailers typically clear summer inventory by August/September. Demand will likely stabilize around 60-70 or dwindle further. Given the high volatility (standard deviation of last 5 periods is ~48 due to the P19 spike), 'default' or pure 'recent_N' sigma might overestimate risk now that the mean has shifted down so drastically. However, to be safe during this transition, a recent_N=5 approach for both mean and sigma captures the decline while retaining memory of the recent volatility to prevent stockouts if a final clearance spike occurs. We aim for a target base stock reflecting the new lower mean (~66) rather than the seasonal high.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Average demand P21-P23 is ~66 units, down from June peak 173. Transitioning to season-end clearance.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29) marks the deep end of the summer season for this short-sleeve SKU. Demand in Period 24 dropped to 39 units, the lowest level since April, confirming a rapid seasonal decline. The 3-period average (P22-P24) is 53 units, significantly down from the peak of 173 in June. Current on-hand inventory is 92 units, which covers nearly 2 periods of expected demand at this reduced rate. The strategy is now aggressive inventory burn-down to minimize holding costs as demand vanishes. We use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both demand and volatility to reflect the new low-volume regime and ensure the base stock calculation prevents unnecessary replenishment (Base Stock < 92 implies Order = 0). Promised lead time (0) remains reliable.

Carry-over insight: Season-end decline accelerating: Period 24 demand dropped to 39 (-43% from P23), confirming rapid exit from summer season as August approaches.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (August 5) signals late-season clearance. Demand has been volatile post-peak (avg ~65 over last 6 periods), oscillating between ~40 and ~80. We use recent_N=6 to capture this specific post-peak decline regime, balancing the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost risk of ending the season with dead stock.

Carry-over insight: Season-end volatility confirmed: Demand erratic in clearance phase (39 -> 74), avg ~65 units. Downward trend generally holds despite weekly noise.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Aug 12 (Period 27). The summer peak is confirmed over. Demand in Period 26 dropped back to 44 units after a brief spike to 74 in P25, highlighting the high volatility characteristic of the end-of-season clearance phase. The average over the last 3 periods is ~52 units, which serves as a realistic baseline for late summer demand, significantly lower than the June peak. Given the erratic nature of recent demand (39 -> 74 -> 44), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to stay responsive to this fluctuating baseline without over-committing to inventory as autumn approaches. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season baseline established: Late summer demand averages ~52 units (P24-P26) with significant weekly volatility (range 39-74), confirming the exit from peak season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 corresponds to late August (2019/8/19). The item is a short-sleeve tee. After the sharp drop from the summer peak (June/July), demand has stabilized into a volatile 'sawtooth' pattern over the last 5 periods (68, 39, 74, 44, 65), averaging ~58 units. Despite being late in the season, demand has not collapsed to zero, and the most recent observation (65) is relatively strong. With only 4 units on hand, stockout risk is imminent. I am switching to 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-peak, high-volatility baseline (~58 units mean) without being skewed by the massive accumulated variance of the earlier peak season (which would inflate inventory unnecessarily). Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-season plateau confirmed: Demand has stabilized around ~58 units (avg of P23-P27) rather than continuing the steep July decline, though volatility remains high (range 39-74).

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) signals the definitive end of the summer season for short-sleeve items. Demand in Period 28 (64) and Period 27 (65) has stabilized slightly above the clearance lows but remains well below the peak levels of June/July. The 5-period average (P24-P28) is approximately 57 units, with volatility decreasing compared to mid-summer. Given the current on-hand inventory of 8 units is insufficient to cover even one period of demand, and the risk of holding excess stock into autumn is rising, a balanced approach is needed. I will use a recent_N=3 average for demand (approx 57 units) to capture the stable late-season baseline, avoiding the noise of the mid-summer peak. I will maintain a moderate safety stock (sigma calculated on recent history) to protect against minor fluctuations like the jump to 74 in P25, while preparing to wind down inventory as autumn approaches.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2. Season is ending; product is a summer tee. Demand has stabilized at a lower off-season level (avg ~55 units over last 6 weeks) compared to the summer peak (100-170+). Fluctuations remain high (39-74 range). Using recent_N=6 to capture this entire post-peak stabilization phase without overreacting to single-week noise (like the low 44 in P29 or high 65 in P27). Promised lead time holds at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand baseline confirmed: Demand for P24-P29 averages ~55 units, indicating a stable post-summer plateau despite weekly volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) marks the seasonal transition to autumn for this short-sleeve SKU. Demand in Period 30 dropped sharply to 25 units, the lowest level since early spring, signaling that the August plateau (~55 units) has broken to the downside. Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit/Holding = 4:1), we must balance inventory reduction with availability. We select 'recent_N' (N=3) for both demand and volatility. This incorporates the sharp drop to 25 while retaining memory of the higher August weeks (64, 44), resulting in a forecast (~44 units) that safely manages the decline without aggressively halting replenishment. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Off-season transition confirmed in September: P30 demand fell to 25 units (-43% from P29), invalidating the August plateau (~55 units) and signaling the start of the autumn low-demand regime for summer tops.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/9/16 (Mid-September). The product is a short-sleeve summer top. Demand has transitioned fully into the off-season/autumn regime. Recent demand in Aug/Sept (P29-P31) has been 44, 25, 41, averaging ~37 units. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (100-170) and even the late-summer plateau (~60). The P30 drop to 25 was followed by a slight rebound to 41 in P31, suggesting the stable off-season baseline is likely around 30-40 units rather than collapsing to zero immediately. Given the high cost of stockouts relative to holding (4:1), we will target this lower baseline but maintain a conservative buffer against volatility. We use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the new low regime quickly, and recent_N=5 for volatility to smooth out the transition noise.

Carry-over insight: Off-season baseline stabilization: Sept demand (P30-P31) averages 33 units, confirming a new stable low-volume regime for off-season sales (approx -40% vs late summer).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Sep 23) marks the start of full Autumn. While Period 30 and 31 suggested a drop to a low 'off-season' baseline (~33 units), Period 32 demand spiked back to 60 units, causing a stockout. This volatility (ranging from 25 to 60 in 3 weeks) indicates the seasonal ramp-down is erratic rather than smooth. To recover from the stockout and buffer against this unpredictability, we switch to an N=5 average (including the 64 from P28 and 60 from P32) which yields a higher baseline (~47) than N=3 (~42), preventing over-correction to the single low point in P30. Lead time remains effectively 0.

Carry-over insight: Off-season volatility confirmed: Period 32 demand spiked to 60 units (+80% vs P30-31 avg), invalidating the 'stable low' hypothesis and indicating jagged seasonal exit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sept 30). Demand has surged back to an average of ~63 units over the last 2 periods (P32: 60, P33: 66), contradicting the early-September 'off-season' dip (P30: 25). This resurgence has caused consecutive stockouts (0 inventory on hand). To stop the bleeding and capture this higher demand regime immediately, I am switching 'mu_hat' to a very responsive N=2 (mean ~63). For 'sigma_hat', I am using N=5 (std ~16) to capture the high volatility observed throughout September (range 25-66) and buffer against further instability. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-season resurgence confirmed: Demand rebounded to ~63 units (P32-P33) after early Sept lows, suggesting a return to baseline or clearance activity and invalidating the 'off-season exit' hypothesis.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (Sep 30) concluded with extremely low demand of 16 units, a sharp drop after two weeks of higher activity (60, 66). This volatility (16 to 66) in late season suggests erratic clearance behavior or weather dependency. The current date is October 7, and demand for short-sleeve viscose tops is expected to remain low as autumn deepens. Although recent peaks exist (66 in P33), the most recent signal (16) and the calendar (Oct) strongly suggest a low-demand regime. The 3-period average is ~47, but heavily skewed by the prior two weeks. The 5-period average is ~41. Given the sudden drop to 16, a conservative forecast using a recent short average (N=5) captures the fluctuating decline better than reacting solely to the last outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Off-season volatility intensifies: Demand crashed to 16 units in Period 34 (-75% vs P33), following a brief resurgence to ~63. This confirms extreme instability during the season exit phase.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Oct 14) confirms a deep off-season regime for this short-sleeve SKU (HM+ Cora tee), with demand in P34 and P35 averaging just 17 units. This follows a volatile clearance phase in September. The forecast is set explicitly low (20 units) to align with this sustained drop and the autumnal calendar date preventing overstocking. However, sigma is calculated using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) to capture the high volatility of the transition period (range 16-66), ensuring a safety buffer remains in case of erratic demand spikes observed in late September. Current on-hand inventory (43) is sufficient to cover this reduced demand, facilitating a natural burn-down.

Carry-over insight: Deep off-season baseline confirmed: Oct demand (P34-P35) averages ~17 units, stabilizing at a low level (vs Sept avg ~41) as the product exits seasonal relevance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21) places us deep in the off-season for this short-sleeve SKU. Demand history for the last 3 periods (P34:16, P35:18, P36:13) confirms a stable, low-volume trough averaging ~15.6 units/week, drastically down from the mid-Sept spikes. Given the high holding cost ($1) and seasonal irrelevance, the priority is preventing overstock. We switch to N=3 for both mu and sigma to focus strictly on this new low-demand regime and exclude the volatile clearance noise from P32-P33. With on-hand inventory at 30 units, this accurately suppresses reordering.

Carry-over insight: October off-season floor confirmed: Demand P34-P36 averages ~16 units, stabilizing at a seasonal low after September's volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date is Oct 28. Demand has firmly settled into a deep off-season trough, consistent with late autumn for a 'short sleeve' summer SKU. Over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 14.25 units with low variance (range 10-18), a stark contrast to the September volatility. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this specific low-volume October regime, discarding the irrelevant higher demand data from September. With 20 units on hand and a lead time of 0, the system should not place an order, allowing inventory to burn down naturally against the low ~14 unit forecast.

Carry-over insight: October off-season stability confirmed: Demand for P34-P37 averaged ~14 units (range 10-18), consolidating the deep off-season low for summer tops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4 (deep autumn). Demand for this short-sleeve summer item has hit a seasonal floor, dropping to single digits (9 units in P38). The product is significantly out of season. On-hand inventory (11) is nearly exhausted relative to even this low demand. We apply 'recent_N' = 3 for mu_hat to closely track the diminishing demand trend (avg ~10.7), and 'recent_N' = 5 for sigma_hat to maintain a minimal safety buffer against small variances without overstocking dead inventory.

Carry-over insight: Off-season depth confirmed: Demand hit single digits (9 units) in Period 38, reinforcing the minimal utility of summer tops in November and lowering the expected baseline from ~14 to ~10 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Nov 18. The product (Summer short-sleeve tee) is deep in the off-season. Demand has stabilized at a very low level (9-13 units) over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), averaging ~11 units. A large unexplained order of 95 units in Period 40 has resulted in excessive on-hand inventory (86 units), which covers ~7 weeks of demand. Given the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), we are entering a period where holding costs exceed profits for the tail of this inventory. Strategy is to strictly prevent further ordering by accurately reflecting the low demand baseline using recent history.

Carry-over insight: Off-season floor stabilized: Demand for P36-P40 maintains a tight range (9-13 units), confirming a persistent low-volume baseline ~11 units for November.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (late Nov) confirms the deep off-season regime for short sleeve tops. Demand for the last 5 periods (P37-41) has averaged ~10 units (range 8-13), showing high stability at this floor. Current on-hand inventory is 78 units, which implies ~7-8 periods of coverage. No new orders are needed. I will maintain recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect this stable low baseline (approx 10) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility, ensuring the system burns down the existing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 corresponds to early December. The product is a short-sleeve viscose tee, firmly in its off-season. Demand in Period 42 rose slightly to 16 units (likely a minor Black Friday effect), but remains very low compared to the summer peak (>100). The 5-period average is approximately 11.2 units. With 62 units on hand, we have roughly 5-6 weeks of coverage. The strategy is to maintain parameters reflecting strictly recent low-volume history to prevent re-ordering and allow inventory to burn down.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Black Friday impact negligible: Period 42 demand only rose to 16 units (vs P41: 8), confirming that even major retail events cannot revive demand for this summer SKU in winter. Off-season baseline ~11-12 units holds.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (Dec 9): The off-season low-demand regime for this summer SKU ('short sleeve', 'soft viscose') is fully established. Demand in Period 43 was 17 units, maintaining the consistent low volume seen since late September. The spike in Period 40 (95 unit order arriving) seems to have been an anomaly or an over-reaction by the system/customer, as subsequent demand has remained very low (8, 16, 17). The Black Friday period (P42) caused a minor bump to 16, but P43 remained at 17, confirming no major winter resurgence. On-hand inventory is 45 units, which covers ~2.5 periods of current demand (avg ~17). Expected lead time remains 0. I will set mu_hat based on the recent off-season average (last 3 periods: 8, 16, 17 -> avg ~14) to avoid overstocking during the low-demand winter months. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this stable low baseline while filtering out the P33/P34 volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline confirmed: December demand (P42-P43) stabilizes ~16-17 units, slightly above the November trough (~11) but firmly in off-season territory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (mid-December) represents the deep off-season for this Summer short-sleeve item. Demand in Period 44 dropped back to 10 units after a brief Black Friday/Early Dec lift (16-17 units), re-confirming the low-volume baseline observed in November (9-13 units). Current on-hand inventory (35 units) significantly exceeds the required safety stock for this demand level (~13 units/period avg). We select 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu and sigma to capture this most recent low-volume, slightly volatile winter regime (avg ~12.6). The OR logic will naturally prevent new orders, allowing excess inventory to burn down towards optimal levels.

Carry-over insight: Holiday lift transient: Period 44 demand dropped to 10 units (from 17 in P43), returning to the ~10-12 unit baseline established in November and confirming that winter holiday demand is sporadic rather than sustained for this summer SKU.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents Christmas week (Dec 23). While defined as an off-season summer SKU, Period 45 demand unexpectedly spiked to 26 units (highest since Sept), depleting inventory to critical levels (9 units). This contradicts the Nov baseline (~11 units) and invalidates the 'transient lift' hypothesis from P44. I am switching to recent_N=4 to capture this December volatility (avg ~17.25, std ~6.6) and ensure sufficient safety stock for potential clearance waves or continued holiday volatility, while maintaining L='default' as lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility surge: Period 45 demand spiked to 26 units (+160% vs P44), breaking the Nov off-season baseline (~11) and confirming significant, jagged demand variances during the December retail peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 corresponds to late December (Dec 30). While recent demand has been low (~17 units) following a transient holiday spike, the historical samples provided for this SKU indicate a strong 'Early Spring' or 'Resort' season starting in early January (Jan 7 sample: 43 units). To prepare for this anticipated regime shift from the winter trough (~15) to the Jan baseline (~43+), I am setting an explicit forecast of 35 units. This balances the current low trend with the historical signal to prevent stockouts as the new season launches. Lead time remains observed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-season signal: Historical samples for January (avg ~50) suggest a sharp demand recovery from the December trough (~17) starting early Jan, indicating the onset of the 'Resort/Early Spring' season for this short-sleeve SKU.
