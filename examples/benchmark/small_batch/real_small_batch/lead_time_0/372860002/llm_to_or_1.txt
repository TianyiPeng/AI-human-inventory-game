Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start (2019-02-11). Historical demand averages ~79 units, with a notable spike to 112 units in the most recent week (Feb 4), likely related to pre-Valentine's Day shopping. Promised lead time is 0. I will use the full provided history (N=5) to establish a baseline mean and variance, capturing the recent volatility without over-indexing on the single high data point. Since no arrival history exists, I default to the promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18, 2019). Product is basic trainer socks. In Period 1, we ordered 96 and demanded 142, stocking out immediately. The demand signal of 142 is significantly higher than the training history max (112), suggesting a potential seasonal upswing or underestimation of the mean in early data. The lead time was confirmed as 0 (same-period arrival) in Period 1. Given the immediate stockout and high demand, I will rely on recent demand history but weight the most recent observation heavily. The history now includes [77, 59, 67, 78, 112, 142]. The average of the last 3 periods (78, 112, 142) is approx 110, showing a strong upward trend. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures this recent surge better than the full history average (~89). Lead time remains 0 (Period 1 order arrived same period).

Carry-over insight: Demand surging: Period 1 demand (142) exceeds historical max (112), indicating strong upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 context: Demand has exploded, jumping from 142 in Period 1 to 311 in Period 2 (vs historical ~78). This suggests a new, much higher demand regime or strong seasonal surge. With high service criticality (ratio 0.8), avoiding stockouts is priority. 

Lead Time: Consistent at 0 periods (concluded P1 and P2 arrived same-period). Keeping 'default'.

Forecast (mu_hat): Traditional averaging lags significantly behind this rapid ascent (avg of last 2 is 226, far below 311). I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to peg the forecast aggressively to the most recent observation of 311, treating the demand as a random walk rather than mean-reverting.

Volatility (sigma_hat): I use 'recent_N' with N=2 (samples 142, 311) to capture the significant volatility and uncertainty associated with this surge, ensuring a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand explosion confirmed: Period 2 demand (311) is >2x Period 1 (142), signaling a major regime shift away from historical average (~80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1053.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (March 4th). Demand has stabilized at a dramatically higher level (Period 2: 311, Period 3: 293) compared to historical averages (~80), suggesting a sustained regime shift likely driven by the product's new popularity or seasonality. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, critical fractile 0.8), stockouts are costly. I set mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=2) to align strictly with the current high plateau (~302) and ignore the ramp-up data in Period 1. However, I set sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) to incorporate the volatility observed during the shift, resulting in a larger safety stock buffer (target stock ~380) to protect against further variance. Lead time consistently observes as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime stabilized: Period 3 demand (293) near-matches Period 2 (311), confirming a new baseline approx. 300 units/period (vs historic ~80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $634.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 5 (March 11). Demand in Period 4 (203) dipped from the highs of Periods 2-3 (~300) but remains significantly elevated above the historical average (~80). The product (cotton trainer socks) likely sees variable demand in transition to Spring. Given the high cost of stockouts (Ratio 4:1) vs holding, we continue to target the 'high regime' but adapt to the recent drop. We select N=3 (periods 2, 3, 4) for our estimator to capture the active high-volume cluster (avg ~269) while discarding the pre-surge history. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 6 (2019/3/18). Demand has clearly shifted from the initial explosion (P2-P3 ~300) to a stabilized plateau around 200 units/period in P4 (203) and P5 (201). While the immediate trend is flat ~200, we must account for the volatility of the recent drop. Since the critical ratio is high (0.8), the cost of understocking is severe. Therefore, we use 'recent_N=3' for both mu and sigma. This includes the tail of the high demand (P3=293), keeping the mean forecast slightly elevated (~232) and the variance estimate robust (~52.5) to generate adequate safety stock. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation confirmed: After peaking ~300 (P2-P3), demand has stabilized at ~200 units/period in P4 (203) and P5 (201).

Daily Reward (R_t): $918.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 Context: On-hand inventory is low (38). Demand has settled into a new high-volume regime significantly above historical levels, though slightly below the initial P2-P3 peak. Recent demand (P4-P6: 203, 201, 239) averages ~214 units. The uptick in P6 (239) indicates potential upward volatility or seasonal spring demand, cautioning against assuming a strict floor at 200. Strategy: Use N=3 for the mean to track the current 'new normal' level (~214) closely. However, use N=5 for sigma to include the higher variance from P2-P3; this larger volatility estimate increases safety stock to protect the 80% service level target against sudden spikes back toward 300.

Carry-over insight: High-regime volatility: P6 demand (239) exceeds the P4-P5 baseline (~200), establishing a functional demand range of [200-240] for the current plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1032.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 corresponds to April 1st; trainer socks are entering peak seasonality (Spring/Summer). Demand in Period 7 (354) exploded, exceeding the previous Period 2 high (311) and breaking the Period 4-6 stabilization (~200 units). The prior N=3 average (~265) significantly lags this new seasonal peak. To prevent further stockouts (Period 7 ending inventory was 0), we switch to an explicit forecast anchored on the most recent demand (354) to capture the rapid upward trend. Sigma is set to N=3 to reflect the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring spike confirmed: Period 7 demand (354) sets new record, breaking ~200 unit plateau; validates seasonal acceleration for trainer socks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1503.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (April 8) reinforces the strong spring seasonal uptrend for trainer socks. Demand in Period 8 (385) surpassed the Period 7 record (354), confirming a high-demand regime significantly above the ~200 unit plateau seen in periods 4-6. With a high critical ratio (0.8) favoring service level, avoiding stockouts is priority. Lead time remains reliable at 0. To capture the rapid upward shift without being dragged down by older low-demand data, I am setting mu_hat using only the most recent 2 periods (avg ~370). For sigma_hat, I use the last 3 periods (capturing the ramp from P6's 239 to P8's 385) to reflect the high volatility/acceleration risk and generate sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand acceleration sustained: Period 8 demand (385) confirms the Period 7 spike (354) was not an outlier, establishing a new high-volume regime >350 units/period driven by seasonality.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (mid-April) context: The SKU is 'Trainer Socks', a highly seasonal spring/summer item. Demand has recently spiked significantly, typical for April/May weather changes. 

Recent Demand History:
- P7: 354
- P8: 385
- P9: 282

The most recent observation (P9: 282) shows a dip from the P7-P8 peak, potentially reverting toward the P6 plateau (~240) or just a weekly fluctuation. However, the season is still early, so assuming a drop back to winter levels is premature. The average of the last 3 periods (354, 385, 282) is ~340. 

Changepoint Detection:
- We are in a high-demand spring regime (P7-P9 average >> P4-P6 average).
- The drop in P9 (282) might suggest P7/P8 were the initial aggressive 'stock-up' peak and demand is settling slightly lower, but it is risky to understock during peak season. 

Strategy:
- Lead Time (L): 0 has been reliable. We use 'default'.
- Demand (mu_hat): Given the volatility (282 vs 385), 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the current high-demand spring window (avg ~340) without overreacting to the single lower point in P9 or the extreme peak in P8 alone. This balances the risk of stockouts during the seasonal peak.
- Variability (sigma_hat): Demand is effectively volatile in this high regime. N=3 provides a responsive safety stock calculation based on the recent fluctuations (range 282-385).

Carry-over insight: Spring volatility established: Demand fluctuates significantly within the high season (282-385 range in P7-P9), requiring responsive N=3 parameters rather than longer-term averages.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22 (Period 11), continuing the high-demand Spring season for trainer socks. Period 10 demand (382 units) rebounded strongly from the Period 9 dip (282 units), confirming the 'Spring volatility' insight and validating the high-volume regime (recent max 385). With On-hand inventory critically low at 3 units and lead time stable at 0 periods, we must restock aggressively to prevent stockouts. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This setting captures the high average (~350 units) while accounting for the significant variance seen in the last 3 periods (ranging 282-385), ensuring the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) covers the upper bound of recent demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29 (late Spring), a peak season for trainer socks. Demand in Period 11 (472 units) set a new record, significantly exceeding the previous high of 385 and causing a stockout. This continues the trend of high volatility and increasing volume observed in April. Given the recent sequence [282, 382, 472], the short-term variance is very high. I am selecting 'recent_N=3' for both mu and sigma. While the Period 9 dip (282) pulls the average down to ~379, the high standard deviation from this volatile set (~95) will increase the safety stock buffer to help cover the upward trend towards 470+ units. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonality intensifies: Period 11 demand hit 472, shattering the previous ~385 ceiling and confirming a strong upward trend for trainer socks heading into May.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 corresponds to early May, and demand for trainer socks has reached a sustained peak, with the last two periods averaging 458 units (472 in P11, 444 in P12). This represents a significant step up from the ~350 unit plateau observed in early April. Given the high stockout cost ($4 margin vs $1 holding), we must prioritize service level. We use L='default' as lead time remains reliably 0. For mu_hat, we use recent_N=3 to closely track the new peak volume (~433 average). For sigma_hat, we use recent_N=5 (covering P8-P12) to capture the broader volatility of the spring season (std dev ~73) rather than just the tight recent peak, ensuring a robust safety stock buffer against fluctuations like the P9 dip.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak established: Late April/May demand (P11-P12 avg 458) has shifted up from the early spring plateau (~350), confirming peak seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (Mid-May) follows a sharp demand drop in Period 13 (261 units) after a sustained high-season peak (avg ~458 units in P11-P12). This volatility (444 -> 261) suggests the peak season might be fracturing or simply experiencing noise. Given the product is 'trainer socks' in May, demand should remain robust, but the sudden drop requires caution. We will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (avg of P11, P12, P13 is approx 392) to capture both the peak and recent dip without overreacting to a single low point. Volatility is extremely high (range 261-472), so we switch to 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma to ensure safety stock is sufficient for another spike. Promised lead time remains 0 and holds consistent in history.

Carry-over insight: In-season volatility spike: Demand dropped 41% from P12 (444) to P13 (261), signaling instability in the high-summer regime despite favorable seasonality.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) falls within the active season for trainer socks, but recent data shows a distinct cooling from the April peak (>440 units). Demand in P14 (288) remained close to P13 (261), suggesting the market has stabilized at a lower mean (~275) rather than merely fluctuating wildly. However, given the high seasonality and the potential for demand to rebound (P11 hit 472), a restrictive inventory policy is risky given the high profit margin ($4 vs $1 holding). I selected N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to blend the two recent lower datapoints (261, 288) with the tail of the high demand (P12 at 444). This produces a higher variance estimate (safeguarding against stockouts) and a mean (~331) that buffers the current lower trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: P14 (288) near-matches P13 (261), confirming a sustained step-down to a ~275 baseline from the late-April peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (May 27) represents prime season for trainer socks. While demand dipped in Period 13-14 (~275 avg), Period 15 saw a significant rebound to 350 units, invalidating the theory of a stabilized lower plateau. The product exhibits high volatility (range 261-472 over last 5 periods). Given the high cost of understocking (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, ratio 0.8), we must defend against the higher end of the demand distribution. A short memory (N=3, avg ~300) would effectively cap inventory below the most recent observation of 350, risking stockouts. Therefore, we switch to N=5 (avg ~363) for both mean and volatility to incorporate the high-demand signals from late April (P11-P12) and the recent rebound, ensuring robust coverage for the summer peak. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: In-season volatility confirmed: Period 15 rebound (350) breaks the short low-demand streak (P13-P14 ~275), validating that the summer regime remains high and erratic rather than stabilizing.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to early June, a peak season for trainer socks. Demand has rebounded strongly from the mid-May dip (Period 13-14), with Period 15 (350) and Period 16 (379) signaling a return to the high-volume summer regime. Lead time remains reliable at 0. To capture this recovery while acknowledging recent instability, we use a responsive N=3 for the mean forecast (averaging the recent climb with the tail of the dip). We use a wider N=5 window for volatility to ensure safety stock accounts for the significant swings observed between Period 12 and Period 16 (range 261-444). Determining the correct stock level is critical as the cost of lost sales ($4) significantly outweighs holding costs ($1).

Carry-over insight: Summer rebound confirmed: Demand in P15-P16 (avg 365) signals a return to high-volume regime >350 units after a brief mid-May dip.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10): Demand for trainer socks in Periods 15-17 has averaged 332 units (350, 379, 268), showing persistent volatility but a high summer baseline despite the dip in P17. The recent P17 drop to 268 breaks the upward momentum seen in P15-P16 but aligns with the volatility seen in P13-P14. Given the product type (trainer socks) and season (June), high demand is still expected, but variability is significant. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. We continue with 'recent_N' (N=3) for both mu and sigma to capture this short-term volatility (avg ~332, std dev is relevant) and maintain a responsive buffer. With 133 units on hand, we need a robust order to cover potential spikes back to ~380+ levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer volatility confirmed: P17 demand (268) dropped significantly from P16 (379), reinforcing the erratic pattern of high peaks (>350) and sudden dips (~260) within the high-volume summer regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Mid-June demand for trainer socks remains in a volatile high-volume regime. While P17-P18 showed a dip to ~277 avg, P16 was 379. To avoid stockouts from sudden recurring spikes, we use a 6-period moving average (avg ~305) which smoothes the recent dip with the prior peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (June 24) is effectively peak summer. Demand history shows trainer socks are highly volatile within a high-volume seasonal regime. The recent pattern is: P17(268) -> P18(286) -> P19(458). This major spike in P19 (458) mirrors the strong peaks seen in late April (472, 444), suggesting that average demand 'dips' (260-280) are temporary and the underlying potential is very high (~450+). Recent carry-over insights correctly note the erratic nature of this summer regime. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit after the P19 stockout, the risk of lost sales is high if we underestimate the rebound. The last 3 periods (P17, P18, P19) average ~337, but the volatility is extreme (ranging from 268 to 458). Using a short memory (N=3) captures this immediate volatility and the latest spike better than a longer average which would be dampened by the dip. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak re-confirmed: P19 demand (458) matched the April highs (472), proving that the dip in P17-P18 was temporary variance, not a seasonal decline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 corresponds to July 1st, deep into the summer season. Trainer socks (SKU 372860002) are effectively re-confirming their peak seasonal potential. After a period of volatility in June (P17-P18 avg ~277), demand has surged back to exceed 400 units/period for two consecutive weeks (P19: 458, P20: 405). Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit/Holding ratio = 4:1) and the observed erratic variance (large swings between ~280 and ~460), we use a short N=3 horizon. This captures the recent upward shift (P19, P20) while maintaining enough standard deviation (via the lower P18) to buffer against the established volatility. On-hand inventory is critically low (21 units), requiring immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak consolidation: July start (P19-P20) manifests strong demand resilience (avg 431) compared to the mid-June dip (avg 277), establishing a primary expectation of >400 units for the deep summer period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 corresponds to July 8, deep into the summer season for trainer socks. Demand remains strong (P19-P21 avg ~406) but volatile (ranging from 356 to 458 recently). The slight dip in P21 (356) follows two very high periods, suggesting natural oscillation within a high-volume regime. Given the high cost of lost sales (profit $4 vs holding $1), we prioritize service level by using a responsive N=3 for mu_hat (tracking the recent ~406 average) while using a broader N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the full volatility spectrum (including earlier dips). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak oscillation: July demand continues to fluctuate significantly (356-458 range in P19-P21) while maintaining a high average (~406), necessitating responsive parameters.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (mid-July) observation shows demand stabilizing in the last two periods (P21: 356, P22: 354), indicating a potential plateau around ~355 units, slightly down from the June peaks (P19: 458). However, given the high volatility observed in the last 4 weeks (range 354-458) and the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding), we maintain a responsive N=4 window. This captures the P19 spike in the average (~393) to protect service levels while acknowledging the recent moderation. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: July Plateau: P21 (356) and P22 (354) show remarkable stability, moderating from the erratic June peaks, establishing a mid-summer baseline of ~355 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (Period 24). A distinct cooling trend is evident, with demand strictly decreasing over the last 5 periods (458 -> 405 -> 356 -> 354 -> 333). While recent demand (last 3 avg ~348) suggests a lower plateau, the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) dictates a service-oriented approach. We use N=5 parameters (avg ~381) to retain memory of the June volatility and peaks, providing a buffer against stockouts should late-summer demand spike again, rather than tightening inventory too quickly against the downward trend. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer Peak Deceleration: Demand has strictly decreased for 5 consecutive periods (P19: 458 -> P23: 333), indicating the high-variance June peak is tapering off.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (late July). Demand has shown a consistent deceleration for 6 consecutive periods (P19=458 -> P24=290). The early summer peak (June/July) is clearly tapering off as we approach August, establishing a new, lower baseline closer to 300 units rather than the 400+ highs. While lead time remains reliable at 0 periods, the primary risk is now overstocking against a falling trend rather than stocking out. Given the volatility (P24=290 vs P22=354), we will switch to a very reactive short-term average (N=3) to catch this downward slope quickly without undershooting if a rebound occurs. P22-P24 average is ~325, but P24 itself was 290; N=3 balances these recent signals well.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand tapering confirmed: Demand has declined for 6 consecutive periods from 458 (P19) to 290 (P24), signaling the end of the high-volume peak summer regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Aug 5 (Period 26). The product (trainer socks) is exhibiting a clear post-peak seasonal decline. Demand has decreased consistently for 6 consecutive periods: 458 (P19) -> 405 -> 356 -> 354 -> 333 -> 290 -> 266 (P25). This confirms the high-summer volume is tapering off as autumn approaches. We expect demand to continue moderating or stabilize in the 200-250 range. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. We select 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to tightly track the downward trend while filtering minor noise. On-hand inventory (88) is insufficient for expected demand (~270), relying on the prompt arrival of the order placed this period.

Carry-over insight: Summer decline ongoing: Demand consistently falling for 6 weeks (P19: 458 -> P25: 266), establishing a post-peak downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $870.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (Aug 12). Demand has consistently declined for 7 consecutive weeks (from peak 458 in P19 to 239 in P26), confirming a strong post-seasonal cooling trend as summer concludes. The current demand level (239) has effectively reset to pre-spike March levels (P6=239). Given the steady downward trajectory (~25 unit drop per period recently), a short-term moving average (N=3) is selected for mu_hat to reduce inventory lag while maintaining service levels (Cost ratio 4:1 favors service). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal cycle reset: Demand has fully retraced from the summer peak (458) back to early spring baseline levels (P26=239 matches P6=239), effectively completing the seasonal high-volume loop.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Aug 19, 2019. Demand for trainer socks has shown a strict meaningful decline for 8 consecutive periods (from 458 in P19 to 221 in P27), signaling the end of the summer peak. The current level (221) is nearing the pre-summer plateau of ~200 units seen in March. With zero observed lead time lead variance, maintaining a tight inventory loop is optimal. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to closely track this downward trend without retaining outdated high-demand statistics from July. This prevents specific overstocking as we enter the lower-volume autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Summer decline continues: Demand has strictly decreased for 8 consecutive periods (P19: 458 -> P27: 221), now piercing the P6 spring level (239) and likely heading toward the P4/P5 baseline (~200).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) marks the tail end of the summer season for trainer socks. Demand has strictly declined for 9 consecutive periods (from 458 peak to 208 current), effectively retracing the entire seasonal curve back to early March levels (P4/P5 ~200 units). The rate of decline is decelerating (-13 units compared to steeper drops earlier), suggesting the demand is finding a floor around 200 units. To manage this descending trend without understocking or overstocking, we use a tight moving average (N=3) for the mean forecast, which aligns with recent values (avg=223) closer to the projected ~200. We use a slightly longer window (N=5) for volatility to capture the variance of the descent itself as a safety buffer. No lead time issues observed.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal floor approaching: Demand decline rate is slowing (-13 units this period vs -44 in deep summer gaps), suggesting stabilization near the ~200 unit historical spring baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (Sep 2) indicates the summer season has fully concluded. Demand has declined for 10 consecutive periods, settling at 199 units in Period 29. This level matches the early spring baseline (Periods 4-5 ranged 201-203), suggesting a stabilization of the seasonal cycle rather than a freefall to 0. The rate of decline has slowed significantly (-9 units vs -40+ previously). I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 (avg ~217) for both mean and volatility to align closely with this new lower plateau (~200) while retaining a slight buffer against early autumn volatility. Promised lead time (L=0) remains reliable.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline established: Demand has stabilized around ~200 units (P28: 208, P29: 199), confirming the return to early spring levels and ending the steep post-summer decline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (Sept 9) confirms the arrival of the Autumn baseline. Demand in Period 30 (189) dropped slightly below the previous stabilization level (~200), reinforcing the return to the early spring low-volume regime seen in periods 4-5. The post-summer decline has fully resolved into a stable plateau around 190-200 units. Given the consistency of this new lower baseline (P28: 208, P29: 199, P30: 189), I will switch to a 'recent_N' estimator with N=3 to closely track this specific autumnal level without being dragged up by the high summer history. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods with no missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline confirmed: Demand has settled into a 190-210 unit range (P28-P30 avg ~199), mirroring the early spring plateau.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (late September) confirms the autumn demand slump for trainer socks. Demand in Period 32 (136) dropped significantly below the prior ~170-200 level, marking a clear downward trend consistent with colder weather reducing demand for 'fine-knit' and 'shaftless' socks. The seasonal decline is now steep, with demand falling for four consecutive periods (P29: 199 -> P32: 136). Given this consistent deceleration, we must lower the forecast aggressively to prevent excess inventory as we head deeper into autumn. We will use a short-term N=3 average (avg of P30-32 = 164) rather than including higher August data points, as the recent trend is strictly negative. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn slump intensifies: Week-over-week declines (P30: 189 -> P31: 168 -> P32: 136) confirm a rapid seasonal exit for trainer socks, with current demand falling below even the early spring startup levels (P1=142).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 demand spiked unexpectedly to 234, breaking a mulit-period downward trend and causing a stockout. This reversal signals either a localized event or a return to the ~200 unit spring/autumn baseline. Starting with 0 inventory, we must react to high volatility. Switching to 'recent_N=3' for both mean and volatility captures the sudden variance (stdev of last 3 periods is high due to the jump from 136 to 234), ensuring the safety stock buffer covers another potential spike while the mean accounts for the recent lows.

Carry-over insight: Trend Reversal: Period 33 demand (234) broke the consistent autumn decline, jumping 72% from P32 (136) and causing a stockout, signalling a potential return to the ~200 unit baseline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7) confirms a stabilization of the demand rebound observed in P33. Demand in P34 (217) remained strong, validating the P33 spike (234) and establishing a new short-term baseline around ~225 units, significantly higher than the P32 trough (136). The observed lead time remains 0. Given the sharp V-shaped recovery, standard averages with N>=3 would underestimate demand by including the P32 outlier (136). Therefore, I use an explicit forecast of 225 (average of P33-P34) to match the current regime. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility (std dev ~52) generated by the recent swing, ensuring sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: P33 and P34 (avg ~225) confirm a sustained rebound from the P32 low (136), establishing a new plateau around 220 units similar to the spring baseline, interrupting the expected seasonal decline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Oct 14) shows indications that the recent 'rebound' to ~225 units in periods 33-34 was temporary or volatile, as Period 35 demand dropped back to 169, closer to the Period 31-32 autumn lows (168, 136). The average of the last 3 periods is ~206 (234, 217, 169), but the most recent point suggests the downward seasonal trend for trainer socks in autumn has resumed. The high volatility (136 -> 234 -> 217 -> 169) makes picking a stable mean difficult. Using a short N=3 average captures the recent mix of spikes and drops without reacting too slowly to the resumed decline. Given lead time is consistently 0, we focus on covering immediate period variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn volatility confirmed: Demand oscillates widely (136 -> 234 -> 217 -> 169) in P32-P35, with P35 signaling a potential return to the low-volume seasonal decline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (Oct 21). Context: We are deep in the autumn season. Demand has been declining since the summer peak, with a recent volatility spike (P33-P34) that seems to have stabilized back into a lower regime. The most recent observations (P35: 169, P36: 117) suggest the seasonal decline is resuming after the brief correction, with P36 hitting a new recent low. The overall trend is clearly downward for 'trainer socks' as colder weather sets in. The brief rebound in P33-P34 (avg ~225) appears to be an outlier or a clearance effect rather than a sustained recovery, especially as P36 (117) dropped significantly below the P32 low (136). We must guard against overstocking while respecting the high volatility. I will use a short memory (recent_N=3) to catch the downward trend quickly, while the volatility estimate will naturally include the recent variance (P34's 217 vs P36's 117). With 0-day lead time holding steady, I will focus on tightening inventory to avoid holding costs as demand likely heads toward <100.

Carry-over insight: Autumn decline resumes: Period 36 demand (117) marks a new seasonal low, confirming that the P33-P34 spike was temporary and the downward trend toward winter levels (<120) has reasserted itself.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (Oct 28). The seasonal decline for trainer socks is solidifying as we enter late autumn/winter. After the temporary volatility in P33-P34 (avg 225), demand in P35-P37 has trended downwards (169 -> 117 -> 150), averaging ~145 units over the last 3 weeks. P37 demand (150) was slightly higher than P36 (117) but fits the general low-volume autumn profile seen in P32 (136). The P33/P34 spike appears to have been an anomaly rather than a sustained recovery. The overall trend is downward toward winter lows (<100 expected based on early Jan history). I will use a short recent_N=3 average to capture this lower baseline (avg ~145) while remaining responsive to further drops as winter approaches. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline validated: Recent 3-period average (~145 units) confirms the high-volume season is over, with demand oscillating in a lower post-seasonal range (117-169).

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 corresponds to early November. Demand for 'trainer socks' (a summer item) has consolidated into a low-volume Autumn regime. The last three periods (P36-P38) show demands of 117, 150, and 131, averaging approx. 133 units. This is significantly lower than the September volatility. I firmly adopt N=3 parameters to exclude the late-September outliers (P33-P34) and align inventory targets with the current inactive season. Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn low regime consolidation: P38 demand (131) aligns with P36 (117) and P37 (150), solidifying a low-volume baseline ~133 units for November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: Nov 11, 2019. Demand in P39 dropped to 86, the lowest level seen since the game started, confirming the deepening low-volume autumn/winter trough for trainer socks. The recent trend (P36: 117, P37: 150, P38: 131, P39: 86) averages ~121 units, stabilizing near the initial historical winter baseline (pre-Period 1 avg ~80-100). The P33-P34 spike (~225) is now fully retraced. Given the extremely low P39 demand and consistent downward pressure, we continue with short-term 'recent_N' parameters (N=4) to align inventory cover with this depressed regime (avg ~121) and minimize holding costs, as volatility remains present (P37 spike vs P39 drop). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter trough deepening: P39 demand (86) sets a new game-low record, confirming the descent into the deep winter low-volume regime (<100 units).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (mid-November): Demand for trainer socks has settled into the expected deep winter trough. The last two periods (86, 95) average 90.5, which aligns closely with the historical data from Jan 2019 (~77). This confirms a low-volume seasonality consistent with the product type. Lead times remain stable at 0. I am switching to shorter-term parameters (N=3) for the demand forecast to align with this lower baseline (~100 units) and prevent overstocking as we enter the lowest demand season of the year. Volatility is estimated over N=5 periods to capture recent fluctuations around this new low mean.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline confirmed: Demand has consecutively stayed under 100 units (P39: 86, P40: 95), validating the return to the historical deep winter low-volume regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (late November) confirms the deep winter trough. Demand has stabilized below 100 units for 3 consecutive weeks (86, 95, 88), averaging ~90. This is the lowest regime of the year. I am switching to short-memory parameters (N=3) to tightly track this low baseline and avoid overstocking before the end of the year, as volatility has also decreased significantly.

Carry-over insight: Winter trough stabilized: P41 demand (88) aligns with P39-P40 (avg ~90), confirming a stable, deep-winter low-volume regime for trainer socks (<100 units/period).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019): We have confirmed a significant trend reversal or 'Black Friday' effect. After stabilizing in a deep winter trough around 90 units (P39-P41), demand suddenly spiked to 182 units in Period 42, causing a stockout. This represents a >100% increase week-over-week. While 'trainer socks' are typically off-seasonal in winter, holiday shopping creates non-seasonal spikes. Given the stockout and the abrupt shift, we must react quickly to avoid further lost sales during the gifting season. We will switch to very short-term estimators (N=3) to capture this recent volatility, as the deep winter baseline of ~90 is no longer reliable for December planning. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday spike confirmed: P42 demand (182) doubled the winter baseline (~90), signaling the start of erratic holiday gifting demand despite the off-season product category.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 44 (Dec 9). The previous 'Holiday Spike' in P42 (182 units) proved transient, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday events, as P43 demand dropped sharply to 69 units (lowest in 6 periods). This confirms the underlying winter baseline remains low (~90 units) but is subject to extreme holiday volatility. Costs ratio (0.8) favors service level, so we must protect against potential gifting spikes in the final weeks before Christmas despite the low P43 signal. We switch to 'recent_N' with N=5 (values: 86, 95, 88, 182, 69) for both mean and variance. This averages the stable baseline, the massive spike, and the subsequent dip to produce a moderate forecast (~104 units) with high variance (~45), ensuring safety stock covers another potential spike without overcommitting if demand remains cold.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility confirmed: P42 spike (182) was followed by a sharp drop in P43 (69), indicating erratic, event-driven demand rather than a sustained seasonal lift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (approx. Dec 16-22) represents the final shopping week before Christmas. While the product (trainer socks) is off-season, recent history shows extreme volatility: P42 spiked to 182 (likely Black Friday) before crashing to 69 in P43 and stabilizing at 81 in P44. The sustained winter baseline appears to be roughly 80-90 units (seen in P39-41 and P44), but the P42 spike forces a need for higher safety stock to cover potential 'stocking stuffer' demand volatility. I select N=3 explicitly to include the P42 spike in the variance calculation, generating a higher sigma_hat and thus a larger safety stock buffer for this critical holiday week despite the lower average baseline (~111 units vs <90 baseline). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline re-confirmed: P44 demand (81) aligns with the P39-P41 baseline (<100), confirming that the P42 spike (182) was an isolated event rather than a sustained seasonal shift.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (Dec 23) is peak Christmas week. While P42 (Black Friday) showed a spike (182), P43-P45 have returned to a winter baseline (~89 avg). However, P45 demand (116) shows a +43% jump from P44 (81), suggesting a late pre-Christmas surge found in retail data. Given the product (socks) is a classic stocking filler, I expect a short-term spike this week similar to or exceeding the Black Friday magnitude before a post-holiday crash. I will set mu_hat explicitly to capture this expected spike, weighing the P42 max (182) and recent upward momentum (116). Lead time remains 0 reliably.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday lift confirmed: P45 demand (116) jumped 43% from P44 (81), signaling the start of Christmas week buying for stocking fillers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is post-Christmas (Dec 30). Demand in P46 (129) was moderate, well below the aggressive order size, leaving valid inventory of 169. Underlying winter baseline remains ~90 units. Selecting recent_N=6 to approximate this low-volume regime while smoothing out recent holiday noise. Current inventory is sufficient to cover expected demand, likely suppressing new orders to burn down stock.

Carry-over insight: Holiday spike subsided: Period 46 demand (129) was moderate compared to the heavy stocking order, leaving excess inventory (169); confirms holiday buying for trainer socks is mild compared to summer peak.
