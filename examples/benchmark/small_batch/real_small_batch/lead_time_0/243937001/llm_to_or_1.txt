Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Current inventory is 0. Historical data from Jan-Feb 2019 shows stable demand for this product (Socks) with a mean of ~78 and std ~8. Given this is the first period, no lead time deviations have been observed, so I will rely on the promised lead time (0 periods) and the full provided demand history to initialize the base stock policy.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (Feb 18). Demand in Period 1 dropped to 54, significantly below the pre-game average of ~78, suggesting a potential post-seasonal cooling for socks as winter progresses. However, with only one data point indicating this shift, we avoid over-correcting. We select `recent_N=3` for mu_hat to incorporate the recent drop (54) while smoothing with the prior two weeks (73, 79), resulting in a forecast that is responsive but not reactive. For volatility (sigma_hat), we use `recent_N=6` (all available history) to maintain a stable safety stock buffer against demand uncertainty. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1 observations (ordered P1, arrived P1), so we retain the default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (Feb 25) shows demand recovering to 72 units in Period 2, bouncing back from the dip in Period 1 (54) and realigning with the pre-game historical average (~78). Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised. With on-hand inventory low at 7 units, we prioritize restocking to meet expected demand. We select N=5 for estimation to capture the recent volatility (the P1 dip) while anchoring on the broader stable history, effectively smoothing the forecast around ~74 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (March 4th). Observed demand in the last 3 periods (54, 72, 48; avg ~58) is noticeably lower than the pre-game January average (~78), suggesting a seasonal taper as winter ends. However, volatility remains high (ranging 48-72). To balance responsiveness to the lower trend with safety against spikes, I am using a moving average of the last 5 periods (mix of pre-game and game data) for demand parameters. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods over the last 3 concluded cycles, confirming immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand dampening observed: recent 3-period avg (58) is ~25% lower than pre-game avg (78), likely seasonal transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (March 11). Demand continues a significant downward trend, with Period 4 demand (38) reaching a new low, roughly half the pre-game average of ~78. This suggests a strong seasonal transition away from this product (socks) as spring approaches. Historical lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent overstocking as demand falls, we switch to a short memory 'recent_N' estimator (N=3) for both mean and volatility, capturing the recent drop (avg ~53) while discarding the high pre-game regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend intensifies: Period 4 demand (38) is a new low, ~50% of pre-game average. Recent 3-period average has dropped to ~53.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-03-18 (Spring transition). Demand Analysis: The downward trend in demand has stabilized slightly but remains significantly lower than the initial historical data. Recent demands [P3: 48, P4: 38, P5: 37] average ~41 units, compared to the pre-game average of ~78. This confirms the seasonal drop in demand for socks as warmer weather approaches. We are entering Period 6. Lead Time Analysis: All orders from periods 1-5 arrived with 0 lead time (same period), so 'L=0' remains reliable. Inventory Status: On-hand is 31 units, with no in-transit. Given the stable low demand, I will continue using a short memory window (recent_3) to calculate parameters, ensuring we don't overstock based on old winter data. The critical fractile is 0.8, favoring service level, but the low demand variance suggests we can run lean.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Demand seems to have plateaued around low 30s-40s range (P4: 38, P5: 37) after the initial drop.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late March 2019; fine-knit sock demand continues to decline as expected for the season (Period 6 demand: 31, the lowest observed). The high-demand winter regime (avg ~78) is no longer relevant. Lead time consistency remains perfect at 0 periods. We select 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to tightly align the base stock with the current low-volume Spring regime (avg ~35.3, low volatility), preventing accumulation of excess inventory given the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (April 1st) confirms the seasonal transition observed in previous periods. Demand for socks has stabilized at a significantly lower level (Spring) compared to the pre-game/early Winter highs. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 36 units (observations: 38, 37, 31, 38), with very low volatility. We switch to 'recent_N' (N=4) for both mu and sigma to tightly calibrate the base stock to this lower regime and exclude the transitional noise from Period 3 (48 units) and earlier. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime (avg ~36) confirmed for 4 consecutive periods (P4-P7), validating the seasonal shift from Winter to Spring for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (early April). The SKU shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (early March), likely due to seasonal transition away from winter socks. Demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) has been remarkably stable: 38, 37, 31, 38, 34 (avg ~35.6). This is roughly half of the pre-game average. Promised lead time remains 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0 (instant arrival) throughout history. Given the stability of the new regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture this specific post-transition level accurately without carrying over the noisy data from the high-demand winter period. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as performance is perfect.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is mid-April (Spring). Demand for these socks has stabilized in a lower seasonal regime (avg ~35 units) since Period 4, significantly below the winter peaks. Promised lead time of 0 remains consistent with zero delivery variance. I am using recent_N=6 for demand parameters to strictly target this Spring baseline (P4-P9) and exclude irrelevant pre-March winter data, effectively managing holding costs while covering current demand levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand continues to trend downwards with the season (April). Period 10 set a new low record (20 units). Recent 5-period average is approx 30.8 units, significantly lower than early game performance. Using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to adapt to this low-volume spring regime while averaging out the single P10 outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring decline deepens: Period 10 demand (20) is ~35% lower than the stable March average (~31-38), suggesting minimal off-season consumption for this SKU.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (Late April). Identifiable seasonal decline for cotton socks continues as weather warms. Demand has dropped consecutively for the last 4 periods (34 -> 31 -> 20 -> 17), establishing a new 'deep spring' low regime averaging ~18.5 units for the last two periods. This is roughly half of the stable March level. Given the rapid descent, I am using a very short memory (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to responsiveness to the dropping sales velocity without overreacting to single data points. Lead time remains stable at 0. The goal is to align inventory levels with the significantly reduced throughput.

Carry-over insight: Deep spring slump confirmed: Demand has fallen below 20 units for consecutive periods (P10: 20, P11: 17), marking a ~50% reduction from the March baseline (~36).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has stabilized at a very low level for 3 consecutive periods (P10: 20, P11: 17, P12: 19), with an average of ~18.7 units. This represents a ~50% drop from the March baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the stability of this new low regime, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current spring/summer consumption floor and avoid overstocking based on older, higher data points.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand floor established: Avg ~19 units over last 3 periods (P10-P12) suggests seasonal decline has bottomed out.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (May 13). Demand has stabilized into a distinct low-volume 'off-season' regime for these socks, fluctuating tightly between 17-20 units over the last 4 periods (P10-13). This confirms the previously identified spring floor. With volatility dropping significantly in this new regime, I am setting both forecast and volatility parameters to use the most recent 4 periods (N=4). This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~18 unit average rather than older winter data, preventing overstocking while maintaining coverage for the stable low-level demand.

Carry-over insight: Off-season stabilization confirmed: Demand remains effectively flat (17-20 range) for 4 consecutive periods (P10-P13), reinforcing the Spring floor.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (May 20) represents late spring. The demand pattern has established a very consistent 'low season' floor over the last 5 periods (P10-P14: 20, 17, 19, 17, 21), averaging 18.8 units. The stockout in Period 14 (demand 21, sold 20) was minor but indicates our previous buffer was slightly too tight. On-hand is 0, so recoverability is key. Given the stability of this low regime, we will use the recent_N method with N=5 for both mean and variance to capture this specific 'spring floor' behavior accurately without being influenced by the higher winter demand. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand floor firmly established: Average ~19 units over last 5 periods (P10-P14) with low volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 demand spiked to 33 units (vs ~19 unit average of prior weeks), causing a stockout. This +60% increase coincides with the week before Memorial Day (May 27), suggesting a holiday-driven demand surge. Current on-hand is 0. To capture this sudden upward shift and the increased volatility while discarding the older low-demand history, we switch to a short-term reactive window (N=3) for both mu and sigma. This prevents understocking if the holiday demand persists into the current week.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P15: Demand jumped to 33 (vs ~19 avg), likely Memorial Day impact, breaking the stable Spring floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 corresponds to early June. The demand in Period 16 dropped significantly to 15 units, following the spike of 33 units in Period 15. This pattern strongly suggests that the Period 15 jump was a transient event (likely Memorial Day sales) and not a regime shift. The underlying demand floor for this off-season item ('Women's Nightwear/Socks') remains in the 15-20 unit range established in late April/May. Given the recent volatility (spike followed by drop), I am using a recent_N=6 window for both mean and volatility. This window captures the baseline (periods 11-14, 16) while incorporating the variance from the spike (period 15) into the safety stock calculation, ensuring resilience without over-forecasting the mean. Lead times remain consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline re-validated: Demand returned to 15 units in Period 16 immediately after the P15 spike, confirming P15 as a transient holiday event and reinforcing the ~15-20 unit off-season floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (June 10) indicates a continued seasonal decline into summer. Period 17 demand dropped to a new historical low of 12 units, confirming that the Period 15 spike (33 units) was a transient event likely linked to Memorial Day. The current demand baseline appears to be softening further from the spring floor of ~19 units towards a summer trough of 12-15 units. I am using recent_N=7 (covering Periods 11-17) to calculate base stock parameters. This window captures the full 'Deep Spring/Early Summer' regime, averaging ~19 units, which provides a safety buffer against the volatility of the recent holiday spike while respecting the generally low off-season volume. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepening: Period 17 demand (12) establishes a new low, significantly below the Spring floor average (~19). Validates continued off-season decline for socks/hosiery in June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has hit a new seasonal low (9 units in P18), confirming the summer trough for socks. The recent 3-period average is 12 units, significantly below the Spring baseline. The P15 spike is now clearly an outlier. We switch to a tight N=3 average for mu_hat to avoid overstocking during this low-demand season, while using N=5 for sigma_hat to retain a safety buffer against minor fluctuations similar to the P15 event. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: Demand dropped to single digits (9 units) in Period 18, establishing a new seasonal low ~50% below the previous Spring floor.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (late June): Demand continues its sharp seasonal decline, hitting a historic low of 4 units in Period 19 (down from 9 in P18 and 12 in P17). This pattern aligns with 'cotton blend socks' being an off-season winter item during the summer heat. With on-hand inventory at 16 units and demand collapsing into single digits, the priority is to minimize holding costs and prevent overstocking. We adopt a highly responsive 'recent_N' (N=3) strategy for both mean and volatility to capture the rapid deceleration (avg ~8.3 units) and ensure the base stock level reflects the new low-volume reality, effectively stopping new orders until inventory bleeds down.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand crash confirmed: Period 19 demand dropped to 4 units, a new historic low ~55% below the previous period, confirming effectively zero interest in winter socks during late June.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 is July 1st. We are in the deep Summer season, which typically represents the annual trough for 'Fine-knit socks' (Winter/Cool weather SKU). Demand in the last two periods has been in single digits (P19: 4, P20: 7), significantly below the Spring baseline. History validates a stable lead time of 0. I am switching strictly to a specific short-term memory (N=3) for demand estimation to align with this new 'Summer Trough' regime (Avg ~6.7 units) and prevent overstocking based on higher Spring data, while maintaining coverage for minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough sustained: Demand remains in single digits (P19: 4, P20: 7), confirming a deep off-season baseline (avg ~5.5 since P19) compared to the Spring floor.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 corresponds to early July (2019/7/8). We are in the depths of the 'Summer Trough' for this winter sock SKU. Demand has stabilized in the single digits for the last 4 periods (values: 9, 4, 7, 9), confirming a very low off-season baseline. With 0 units on hand and 0 in transit, we are at critical risk of stockout. I am selecting 'recent_N' = 5 (periods 17-21) to estimate parameters. This window (demand avg ~8.2) captures the low summer level while factoring in slightly higher variance than the absolute minimum, providing a small buffer against stockouts which are 4x more costly than holding inventory. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer floor confirmed: Demand holding in single digits (avg ~7.25, range 4-9) for last 4 periods (P18-P21), establishing a stable off-season low.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-07-15. We are seeing a clear recovery from the deep summer trough (P19 low of 4 units). Demand has grown consecutively for 3 periods (7 -> 9 -> 11). Crucially, we have ended P21 and P22 with 0 inventory, essentially 'chasing' the rising demand curve and likely capping sales (P22 demand=11 matched exactly with availability=11). To break this cycle of stockouts and get ahead of the recovery trend, I am setting an explicit demand forecast of 13 units (projecting the trend) rather than averaging the lower recent history. With a high critical ratio (0.8), stocking out is costly. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer recovery validated: Demand has risen consecutively for 3 periods (P19: 4 -> P22: 11), suggesting the deep seasonal trough has passed and consumption is normalizing toward pre-summer levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22 (Period 24). The observed demand in Period 23 (7 units) interrupted the previous 3-period upward trend (4->7->9->11), indicating that the 'recovery' is actually a noisy stabilization in the low double-digits/high single-digits rather than a linear return to high volumes. To avoid being dragged down by the absolute trough (4 units in P19) while acknowledging the volatility (range 7-11), I am using the most recent 4 periods for parameters. This sets a target base stock around 10-11 units, which balances the cost of lost sales (Profit $4) against holding risk ($1) in this uncertain summer regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization: Period 23 (7 units) halted the upward trend seen in P19-P22, suggesting demand has settled into a fluctuating range (7-11 units) rather than continuing a sharp linear recovery.

Period 25 (July 29) continues the deep summer slump for winter socks. Demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) has averaged ~7.8 units, ranging from 4 to 12. Most recently, Period 24 saw a drop back to 4 units after a brief fluctuation. The P23 carry-over insight noted a potential recovery, but P24's low demand (4) negates that, suggesting the product remains in the off-season trough. Given the consistent lead time of 0 (same-day arrival), I will adopt a highly responsive 'recent_N' policy with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the current low-volume regime accurately without overreacting to single-period noise like P24's drop. No lost shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: Summer slump persistence: Demand fluctuations (4-11 units) continue through late July without a sustained recovery trend, reinforcing the prolonged off-season trough (avg ~7.8 since June).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (Aug 5) falls in the deep summer off-season for socks. Demand in the last 3 periods (7, 4, 5) has averaged ~5.3 units, reinforcing the ongoing seasonal trough. The fluctuations seen in early July (up to 11) have dampened back to the lower single digits. Given the 0-period lead time consistent history, we use 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand parameters to tightly align inventory with this low-volume regime (avg ~7.2 over last 5 periods) while avoiding overstocking before the autumn signals appear.

Carry-over insight: Summer trough stabilizes at historic lows: Demand averaged ~5.3 units over the last 3 periods (P23-P25), narrowing the fluctuation range to single digits and confirming a persistent seasonal bottom.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12 (Period 27). We are deep in the 'Summer Trough' for this Winter sock SKU, with demand fluctuating between 4 and 11 units over the last 5 periods (mean ~7.2). Period 26 saw demand rise to 9 from a low of 4-5, suggesting volatility within the low range. Given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, we prioritize service level. We select N=5 to capture the full recent range (4 to 11) rather than just the lowest recent values, providing a slightly higher safety stock buffer as we approach the potential end-of-summer transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand signaled a sharp recovery in Period 27 (18 units, up from ~7 avg), indicating the end of the summer trough (Back-to-School/Autumn start). Current inventory is 0 causing lost sales. We switch to a highly responsive recent_N=2 forecast to chase this upward trend immediately.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal recovery confirmed: Period 27 demand (18) doubled vs recent summer avg (~7), signaling start of Autumn/Back-to-School ramp-up.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (late August) confirms the seasonal transition trend identified in Period 28. Demand in Period 28 (13 units) remained significantly above the summer trough average (~7 units), validating the shift toward autumn levels. While lower than Period 27's spike (18), the sustained demand in the teens suggests a new baseline regime. I am utilizing 'recent_N' = 3 for both mean and volatility to capture this distinct 'Pre-Fall' regime (avg ~13.3) and discard the irrelevant single-digit summer data from July. This rapid adaptation protects service levels during the active ramp-up phase while lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up sustained: Demand in P28 (13) confirms departure from summer lows (avg ~7), establishing a new pre-season baseline in the low teens (avg ~13.3 over last 3 periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Early Autumn baseline confirmed in the mid-teens (avg ~15 over P27-P29), significantly higher than summer lows. Current on-hand (4) is critically low against this new demand level. Using recent_N=3 to target this new regime while discarding July data. Labor Day week may bring slight volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand surged to 34 units (vs ~14 avg in prior 3 weeks), driven by the Labor Day holiday and the onset of Autumn. Unlike the Memorial Day spike (Period 15) which was followed by a summer decline, this spike aligns with the seasonal transition to cooler weather (similar to March demand levels of 31-38 units). I infer that demand has shifted to a new, higher regime typical of Spring/Autumn rather than reverting to summer lows. Therefore, I switch mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value of 34 (persistence forecast) to aggressively prevent stockouts (Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1). Sigma is calculated over the last 4 periods to capture the volatility of this rapid transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime established: Period 30 demand (34) matches Spring levels (March avg ~35), confirming the end of the Summer trough. While potentially amplified by Labor Day, the shift toward cooler weather suggests this higher volume is the new baseline, unlike the transient Memorial Day spike.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Sept 16) confirms the autumnal demand shift is robust. Following the sharp recovery in Period 30 (34 units), Period 31 sustained high volume with 39 units demanded, solidly establishing a new high-demand regime comparable to early Spring levels (March avg ~35). The summer trough (avg ~5-8 units) is definitively over. With cooling weather and back-to-school/work season in full effect, demand for basic cotton socks has returned to normal levels. Given the rapid acceleration (14 -> 34 -> 39), we must aggressively update the forecast parameters to capture this new mean immediately, or risk stockouts (Inventory is currently low at 4 units). I will switch to a purely recent_N(3) approach for mu_hat to discard the summer lows and focus entirely on the P29-P31 ramp-up (avg ~28, weighted towards recent highs). Holding cost is manageable vs profit ratio (0.8), justifying responsive service levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime fully confirmed: Period 31 demand (39) reinforces the jump seen in P30 (34), establishing a new 'normal' baseline ~35-40 units, significantly higher than the Summer trough.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (late September) marks the acceleration of the Autumn/Winter season for socks, confirmed by a sharp surge in recent demand. Demand jumped from summer lows (avg ~7) to 34 (P30), 39 (P31), and 53 (P32), establishing a rapid upward trajectory. The most recent demand (53) is the highest since February, signaling a full return to high-volume seasonality. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~42) to capture this rising trend without dragging in the irrelevant summer data. The volatility has also increased with the volume, so 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat is appropriate to maintain service levels. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge accelerates: Demand hit a new season high of 53 in Period 32, continuing the sharp upward trend (34->39->53) and fully exiting the summer trough.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has exploded to 93 units in P33, matching peak Jan 2019 levels and signaling a full return to the high-volume Winter regime. Current inventory is 0 with consecutive lost sales. We must aggressively pivot parameters to catch up with this exponential trend. Switching mu_hat to explicit 115 (approx P33 + safety buffer) to prevent further stockouts, as trailing averages lag too far behind the 75% period-over-period growth. Sigma set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility (39->93 range).

Carry-over insight: Winter peak regime confirmed: Period 33 demand (93) matches Jan 2019 highs (~91), confirming full exit from Autumn ramp-up into peak season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (Oct 7) context: Demand has surged aggressively, confirming the Winter peak season is in full effect. Period 34 demand (108) exceeded the previous high (93), and both are significantly above the Summer/Autumn baselines. The last 3 periods show a clear geometric ramp-up: 53 -> 93 -> 108. This suggests we are returning to the high-demand regime seen in Jan 2019 (avg ~78 with peaks >90). Given the profit/holding ratio (0.8) favors service level, and the risk of stockouts during this steep ascent is high (sold out in P32, P33), I will switch to `recent_N` with a very short window (N=3) to catch this rapid upward trend immediately without being dragged down by the low September data. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak intensity confirmed: Demand crossed 100 units for the first time (P34: 108), surpassing Jan 2019 levels. This validates an aggressive Geometric growth phase for Oct-Dec.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 14 (Period 36). We are deep in the Autumn/Winter peak season for socks. Demand has surged to historic highs (113 units in P35), significantly exceeding the Jan 2019 baseline (~80-90). However, the rate of growth has decelerated (deltas: +40, +15, +5), suggesting demand is stabilizing around the 110-115 level rather than continuing exponential growth. Given the high cost of stockouts relative to holding cost (4:1), we use an explicit forecast of 115 to capture this high plateau immediately, as trailing averages would undershoot the new baseline. Lead time consistently observed as 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Peak demand plateauing: Growth slowed significantly (+5 units in P35 vs +15 in P34), stabilizing around 113 units, well above Jan 2019 levels.

Peak season demand continues to accelerate (113 -> 126 in P36), causing repeated stockouts. Simple averaging lags behind this aggressive trend. I am using an explicit forecast of 139 (projecting the recent growth of +13 units) to catch up to the curve and prevent lost sales. L remains 0 as reliable.

Carry-over insight: Peak season acceleration continues: Period 36 demand (126) broke the brief P35 plateau (113) and set a new record, confirming that the ceiling has not yet been reached for the Winter season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (late Oct/early Nov) confirms the Winter peak regime is in full swing. Demand reached a new high of 130 units in Period 37, though the growth rate has slowed (+3% vs +11% prior). The sustained high volume (avg 123 over last 3 periods) significantly exceeds January levels, indicating strong seasonal performance. To maintain high service levels (critical ratio ~0.8) without excessive holding costs, we use a short memory (N=3) for the mean forecast to approximate the current high plateau (~123 units) while adhering to the N>=3 constraint. We use a slightly longer window (N=5) for volatility to capture the variance observed during the recent ramp-up phase (93-130 range), ensuring adequate safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak plateauing: Period 37 demand (130) marks a new high but growth slowed to +3% (from +11%), suggesting demand is stabilizing in the 120-130 range for late October.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (Nov 4) represents the onset of the peak holiday buildup. While Period 38 saw a temporary dip to 101 units (down from 130 in P37), the broader trend since late September is aggressive growth (avg ~114 over last 5 periods). The dip in P38 could be noise or a brief pause before the Thanksgiving/Black Friday acceleration. Given the product (socks) is highly relevant for winter and gifting, and Jan 2019 historicals show consistent high demand, I must treat the P38 drop cautiously and maintain a robust forecast. The current on-hand of 35 is critically low given demand is frequently exceeding 120 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high-volume active regime (P34-P38 avg = 115.6) while smoothing out the single-period dip, ensuring we don't under-order right before the holiday rush. Lead times remain consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak volatility: Demand dipped to 101 in P38 after reaching 130 in P37, suggesting high variance (std dev ~13) around a high mean (~115) during the pre-holiday season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) context: We are deep in the Winter season. However, observed demand has dropped sharply for two consecutive periods (130 -> 101 -> 71), contradicting the typical holiday ramp-up expectation and signaling high volatility or a potential correction from an October stocking peak. Despite the drop to 71, the cost of understocking (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) is high, and the seasonal context suggests demand capability remains strong. 

Decision: I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This averages recent values (approx 100) rather than chasing the lowest datapoint (71), providing a buffer against the high volatility (sigma ~30) and preventing stockouts if demand snaps back to peak levels. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter Demand Correction: Demand has contracted sharply for two consecutive periods (130 -> 101 -> 71), falling ~45% from the Period 37 peak despite the November timeframe. This indicates extreme volatility (~30 unit swings) or a reversion from an October stocking high.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18). We are in the pre-holiday peak season. Demand in Period 40 (87) rebounded from the dip in P39 (71), confirming that the P39 drop was likely volatility rather than a sustained crash. The overall trend for Nov-Dec is high volume. The recent series (P34-P40) is: 108, 113, 126, 130, 101, 71, 87. The average of the last 7 periods (peak season) is ~105. The average of the last 4 periods (P37-P40) is ~97. Given the upcoming Thanksgiving and December holidays, I expect demand to remain strong or grow. I will use a recent_N=5 approach to capture this high-volume regime (avg ~103) while smoothing out the extreme volatility seen in P39. Lead time remains 0 reliably.

Carry-over insight: Winter peak stabilization: After a surge to 130 and a dip to 71, demand seems to be finding a volatile equilibrium around ~90-100 units (P40: 87).

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (Nov 25) effectively marks the start of the core holiday season/Black Friday week. Demand has been volatile but high: P37=130, P38=101, P39=71, P40=87, P41=92. The average for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is ~96.2, with sigma ~21. Although there was a dip in early Nov, P41's demand of 92 suggests stabilization around the 90-100 level. With the holiday shopping window opening (Black Friday is Nov 29 in 2019), demand is expected to surge again or at least maintain this high plateau. I will use a recent_N=5 approach for both mean and sigma to capture this specific 'pre-holiday stabilization' regime (avg ~96). Lead time remains reliably 0. On-hand is 33, which is low relative to daily demand (~90+), so aggressive replenishment is needed to prevent stockouts during this critical sales week.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand baseline established: Nov demand stabilized around ~90-95 units (avg P40-P41), recovering from early Nov dip, likely anticipating Black Friday surge.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (Dec 2) marks the start of the holiday peak for socks. Demand in Period 42 surged to 127 units (from ~90 in P40-41), breaking the November lull and validating the expected pre-Christmas ramp-up. Current on-hand is 0 with no incoming stock, creating immediate stockout risk. The recent demand jump (+35 units in one week) mirrors the Oct peak behavior. To capture holiday sales, we must pivot back to the high-volume regime seen in late Oct (mean ~115-125). I will use a short-term average (recent_5) to capture the blend of the recent spike (127) and the high baseline (87-101), while acknowledging the potential for further increases as gift-buying intensifies. The demand volatility remains high, warranting a responsive sigma.

Carry-over insight: Holiday surge confirmed: Demand jumped to 127 in Period 42 (+38% vs prev week), signaling the start of December peak. This aligns with Oct peaks (126-130) and suggests a return to >120 unit weekly volume for the holiday season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 corresponds to December 9th, a critical pre-Holiday shopping week for gift items like socks. Period 43 demand (65) showed a sharp -49% drop from the Period 42 Black Friday peak (127), consistent with a post-promotional 'hangover' or lull. However, demand is expected to rebound for the final Christmas push (mid-December). To manage this extreme volatility (swinging from 127 to 65), we adopt a responsive N=3 strategy. This captures the high variance in the safety stock calculation (keeping inventory coverage robust against potential spikes) while averaging the recent peak and lull to set a moderate baseline (~94 units) rather than reacting solely to the dip.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility established: Post-Black Friday demand dropped -49% (P42: 127 -> P43: 65), confirming a 'peak-lull' oscillation pattern rather than a smooth trend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 16, the critical pre-Christmas shopping week. Demand in Period 44 (84 units) recovered +29% from the post-Black Friday lull (65 units), confirming a secondary holiday demand wave. Given the extreme recent volatility (127 -> 65 -> 84), I am using a short N=3 memory. This captures the Black Friday peak (127) and the recent recovery, resulting in a high variance estimate that increases safety stock (~118 target) to cover potential pre-holiday surges. Pipeline is clear (0 in-transit) and lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Christmas demand recovery: Demand rebounded +29% (65 to 84) in Period 44, validating a 'peak-lull-peak' holiday oscillation pattern rather than a linear decline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). Based on the product category (socks - a popular gift item) and typical retail behavior, demand should peak now or have just peaked, followed by an immediate post-holiday cliff. Observed demand in Period 45 was 96, confirming the rebound from the Period 43 lull. The pattern 'peak (127) -> lull (65) -> rebound (84) -> peak (96)' suggests strong holiday consumption. Given the short lead time (L=0), we must cover immediate demand. However, historical post-Christmas weeks (Jan onwards) usually see a drop. Since we are in the final week before Christmas, demand is likely to remain high or spike one last time before dropping. I will maintain a high forecast (recent_N=5 captures the volatile holiday average ~92) to prevent stockouts during this critical week, acknowledging that excess inventory will be carried into the lower-demand January period. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday dominance confirmed: Dec demand averaged ~93 units (P42-P45), significantly higher than Nov (~83), validating the expected seasonal gift surge.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on Dec 30, marking the end of the holiday gifting season. Demand in Period 46 dropped to 72, closely matching the Jan 2019 historical baseline (70 units). I am switching to a recent_N=4 forecast (avg ~79) to blend the holiday tail with the lower post-holiday reality, avoiding overstock as demand normalizes down from the December highs (90+). Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-season normalization confirmed: Period 46 demand (72) dropped ~25% from Period 45, aligning with Jan 2019 historicals (70) and signaling the end of the holiday peak.
