Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No inventory on hand and no pipe yet. We have historical data for 5 samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111). The average is 89.8 and std dev is approx 17. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period, we have no observed lead times to analyze, so we rely on the promised lead time and the 'default' statistics (all available history) to initialize the base stock. The critical ratio is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), implying a moderate service level target. Using `default` for now allows the backend to use the provided valid history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. We integrate the realized Period 1 demand (108) with the 5 provided historical samples (avg ~90) to create a robust demand forecast. The combined mean is approx 92.8 units/period with a standard deviation of ~16.9. With a promised lead time of 2 periods (L=2), we must cover demand for the review period plus lead time (L+1=3 periods). We use explicit parameters to ensure the backend uses this broader dataset rather than just the single observed period. The target base stock will be calculated from these aggregates (mean ~278.5, sigma ~29.3) to replenish the empty inventory and in-transit pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 context: In-transit is 239 (matches P1+P2 orders, no lost items). Promised lead time is 2, arrivals expected starting next period (P1 order arrives P3, seen in P4). Demand analysis: Realized demand in P1 (108) and P2 (124) is significantly higher than the provided historical samples for these periods (100, 69). The P2 deviation (124 vs 69) indicates historical data may be unreliable or a surge is occurring. Strategy: Shift forecast to rely entirely on recent realized demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat captures the new average (~116/period). Using 'explicit' sigma_hat (40) to provide a wider buffer than the small 2-period sample standard deviation would suggest, hedging against the volatility observed in P2.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected: P1-P2 actuals avg 116 vs historical avg ~85; P2 actual (124) was +80% over historical sample (69).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 should arrive in P3 (visible in 'Period 3 conclude' at the start of P4). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This means the order ordered in Period 1 (118 units) has NOT arrived yet. This indicates the actual lead time is likely greater than 2 periods (at least 3). 

Demand Analysis:
- Historical samples provided in context: P1=100, P2=69, P3=92, P4=77, P5=111 (Avg ~90).
- Actual demand observed in game history: P1=108, P2=124, P3=85 (Avg ~105.7).
- The carry-over insight noted a surge in P1-P2. P3 demand (85) dropped back closer to historical levels, but the overall recent average is still higher than the static history.

Decision:
1. Lead Time (L): Since the P1 order (due P3) did not arrive, L is effectively > 2. I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to ensure the safety stock calculation covers this extended risk period.
2. Demand (mu_hat): I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (P1, P2, P3 actuals: 108, 124, 85) to capture the higher recent demand trend rather than the older historical samples.
3. Volatility (sigma_hat): I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the volatility of the actual game demands (range 85-124).

Carry-over insight: Lead time deviation detected: Period 1 order did not arrive in Period 3 (Promised 2 periods -> Actual > 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 begins with a high inventory position (182 on-hand + 195 in-transit) following a 'bunched' arrival in Period 4 where a late order (L=3) and early order (L=1) arrived simultaneously. Current Demand (P3=85, P4=79) has cooled from the P1-P2 surge, averaging closer to historical levels (~90). The Period 2 order (121 units) is still in transit (L>=3), confirming lead time instability. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average of L=2 (avg of 1 and 3). For demand parameters, I use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the local volatility (surge and cooling) rather than the smoother long-term history. The high inventory position compared to the base stock implies a likely zero order to burn off excess.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: observed L=3 (late) and L=1 (early) arriving in same period. P2 order remains valid in-transit (L>=3). Demand stabilizing: P3-P4 average (82) indicates the early surge has subsided.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Critical accumulation of evidence regarding P2 order (121 units): ordered Period 2, it has not arrived by start of Period 6 (4 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). This lost/delayed order inflates the 'In-transit' count (250) seen by the backend, suppressing new orders. I must increase L to 3.0 (explicit) to raise the Target Base Stock (approx 4x mean demand) sufficiently to overcome this phantom pipeline inventory and force a replenishment order (calculated order ~116 vs ~50 if L=2). Demand parameters N=5 reflect the sustained higher average (99.2) versus historicals.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (121 units) effectively lost (4 periods elapsed without arrival). Lead time variance high (1 to >3 periods). Demand stable around 99-100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 Context: On-hand is 0 (stockout in P6). The pipeline shows 346 units, but 121 of these (from Period 2) are 5 periods old and likely lost ('ghost inventory'). Demand has stabilized around 98-100 units in P5-P6. 

Decisions: 
1. L set to 'explicit' 4.0. Increasing L from the promised 2 to 4 inflates the base stock target. This compensates for the 121 units of lost/ghost inventory that the backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit', and provides a buffer for observed lead time volatility (up to 3 periods). 
2. mu_hat/sigma_hat use 'recent_N' 5 (Periods 2-6). This captures the recent stability (P5-P6 ~99) while smoothing out the dip in P3-P4 and the spike in P2, yielding a robust average of ~97 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P5-P6 avg 99 (recovering from P3-P4 dip). P2 order (121 units) remains lost, necessitating pipeline compensation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 demand (122) confirms a return to higher volume levels (similar to Period 2), pushing the recent average (last 3 periods) to ~107 units. The arrival of the Period 4 order in Period 7 confirms a Lead Time of 3 periods is the current standard (observed twice: P1->P4, P4->P7). The Period 2 order (121 units) is now 6 periods old and is treated as lost phantom inventory. To compensate, I am using an explicit mu_hat that calculates the base requirement (107 avg * (1 review + 3 lead) = 428) and adds the 121 lost units (Total ~550) to negate the 121 units stuck in the 'In-transit' count. L is set to 3 to match observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliably L=3 (P4 order arrived P7). P2 order (121 units, 6 periods old) confirmed lost; requires permanent pipeline compensation. Demand high/volatile (P7=122), raising short-term avg to ~107.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: On-hand is critically low (60) relative to demand (~120). Order P2 (121 units, 7 periods ago) is definitively lost but remains in backend 'in-transit', suppressing replenishment. Order P6 (96 units) was overtaken by P7 but is likely valid (L=3, arrives now). Strategy: Use explicit L=3 to model slow arrivals (safety). Compensate for lost P2 order by adding 121 to the demand forecast. Forecast: Avg demand (P5-P8) is ~110. Horizon (1+L)=4. Base needs=440. Adjustment=+121. Total mu_hat=561. This forces an order allowing for the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (121 units) confirmed lost; requires permanent pipeline offset. P6 order (96 units) overtaken by P7, indicating L variable (1 to 3). Recent demand sustained high (~120).

Daily Reward (R_t): $505.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: P9 demand surged to 145 (trend P7-P9 avg ~129), confirming a higher demand regime; forecasting ~130/period moving forward. Critical pipeline failure detected: P2 order (121 units, 8 periods old) is definitely lost. Additionally, P6 order (96 units) ordered in P6 has not arrived by P9 conclude (elapsed 3 periods, breaching the max observed L=3). I am treating both as lost/phantom inventory (Total Offset = 121 + 96 = 217). My `mu_hat` strategy sums expected demand over 3 periods (130*3 = 390) plus the phantom offset (217) to force the backend to re-order replacements. Using `explicit` L=2 as a stable planning horizon amidst mixed actuals (1 vs >3). `sigma_hat` set to 40 to buffer observable high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high: P7-P9 avg ~129 vs historical <100. Pipeline Loss: P2 (121) lost; P6 (96) now overdue (>3 periods) and likely lost. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than system 'in-transit'.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 11. Demand is in a high regime (avg ~126 over last 4 periods). Critical issue: 217 units of 'in-transit' inventory are lost orders from P2 (121) and P6 (96) that never arrived (P6 now 5 periods old vs max obs L=3). Effective valid pipeline is only 349 units (orders P9, P10). The system sees 566 pipeline and will not order if we use standard parameters. To force a recovery order, mu_hat is manually set to 770. This target represents: Desired Real Coverage (4 periods @ 126 = 504) + Lost Pipeline Offset (217) + Safety Buffer. This ensures Order \u2248 770 - 566 (System Pipe) \u2248 204 units, restoring valid coverage to ~4.5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom inventory confirmed: 217 units (Orders P2 & P6) lost. Demand stabilized in high regime (~126 avg).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12. Identifying Phantom Inventory: Orders from P2 (121) and P6 (96) are confirmed lost (ages 10 and 6 periods), creating a 217-unit 'phantom' gap in system inventory (System IP 801 vs Real 584). Recent demand P7-P10 was high (~126) but P11 dropped (89); forecast conservative ~120 units/period. P9 order (146) is 3 periods old, fitting the observed L=3 pattern for late arrivals (seen in P1, P4, P5), so we assume it arrives P12 rather than being lost. Real pipeline (584 units) covers >4 periods of demand (480 units), so no new order is expected (Order=0). We set explicit 'mu_hat' to (Real Demand * (L+1) + Phantom) = (120*4 + 217) \u2248 697 to correct the BaseStock target for the phantom inventory and ensure future correct ordering.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed at 217 units (Orders P2 & P6 lost). P9 order (146) late (3 periods elapsed), matching historical L=3 pattern. Demand volatility continued with P11 drop to 89.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision. Context: 'Regular' chips profit ratio (0.8) favors service. Situation: Two orders (Period 2: 121, Period 6: 96) are confirmed lost, creating 217 units of 'phantom' inventory in the in-transit pipeline (System 452 - Valid 235 = 217). Backend sees 699 total stock (247 on-hand + 452 pipeline), masking the need to replenish. Strategy: Manually offset phantom inventory by inflating Target Base Stock. Forecast: Demand has cooled slightly (P11-12 avg ~96 vs P7-10 avg ~126), but setting parameters for moderate demand (~115) to ensure safety. Lead time fluctuates between 2 and 3 (P12 arrivals confirmed both). Calculation: Real Target (L=3 coverage) = 4 periods * 115 demand + safety \u2248 500. Adjusted Parameter Target = 500 + 217 (phantom) = 717. Rounding to 720. I set mu_hat=720, sigma_hat=0.1 (minimal, relying on mu), and L=3.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand cooling (P11-12 avg 96 vs P7-10 avg 126). L mixed 2-3 periods (P12 arrivals). Phantom inventory stable at 217.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 Analysis:
1. **Demand Context**: Recent demand is cooling significantly. P11=89, P12=102, P13=73. The average of the last 3 periods (88) is much lower than the P7-P10 peak (~126). I will use a short recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend quickly, assuming the high volatility period is ending.

2. **Inventory & Pipeline Audit**: 
   - On-hand: 174.
   - System In-transit: 474.
   - Observed Arrivals in P12: P9 (L=3) and P10 (L=2).
   - Pending Orders: P11 (235), P12 (0), P13 (22).
   - Lost Orders (Phantom Inventory): P2 (121) and P6 (96) are confirmed lost (never arrived, many periods past due). Total Phantom = 217.
   - Effective In-transit = 474 (system) - 217 (phantom) = 257 (likely P11+P13).
   - Total Valid Position = 174 (OH) + 257 (Effective Pipeline) = 431.

3. **Lead Time**: Recent arrivals (P12) showed L=2 and L=3. The long-term pattern suggests calculating an average or assuming a safe buffer is best, but given the instability, sticking to 'explicit' or 'calculate' is safer. Since L=2 was recently observed again alongside L=3, the average is likely slightly above 2. I'll use L=3 explicitly to be safe given the history of L=3 arrivals and lost orders, ensuring the coverage period is sufficient.

4. **Critical Order Logic**: 
   - We need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand.
   - Forecast demand/period ~88. Total need ~352.
   - Current Valid Position (431) > Need (352).
   - The system sees 174 + 474 = 648. It thinks we are massively overstocked.
   - To force an order if needed (though unlikely given the high valid position), or at least allow the system to see the truth, we must offset the phantom inventory. 
   - Target Base Stock ~ 352 + Safety Stock.
   - System Base Stock = mu_hat + z*sigma.
   - To negate the 217 phantom units, we would need to inflate the base stock target by +217.
   - However, even our *valid* position (431) covers the demand (352). We actually *are* overstocked relative to the cooling demand (P13=73). We likely don't need to order this period. P11's large order (235) is physically incoming (likely arriving P14 or P15). 
   - Therefore, I will set parameters to reflect the true demand cooling (N=3) and a conservative L=3. I won't artificially inflate to hide phantom inventory this specific period because we genuinely have enough inventory (valid position > demand during lead time).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P11-P13 avg ~88 vs P7-P10 avg ~126. Phantom inventory remains 217 units (Orders P2 & P6). Recent lead times mixed 2-3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: Demand continues to cool significantly (P14=63, P12-P14 avg=79.3), well below the prior peak regime (avg ~126). On-hand inventory is high (346) relative to this reduced demand. Phantom inventory of 217 units (lost orders from P2 and P6) persists in the 'In-transit' figure (239 total), masking the true lower pipeline (only 22 valid units). Recent observed lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods (avg ~2.67). We set mu_hat explicitly to ~135 (estimated real demand ~75 + phantom offset ~60) to counteract the ghost inventory, although with current high on-hand, the order quantity will likely be zero regardless. L and sigma are set to recent history to capturing the cooling trend and mixed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P12-P14 avg ~79 vs P7-P10 avg ~126. Phantom inventory stable at 217 units (Orders P2 & P6). Lead time fluctuates 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: On-hand 204. 'In-transit' shows 239, but 217 units (Orders P2 & P6) are confirmed lost phantom inventory (elapsed time >> lead time). Real pipeline is only 22 units (Order P13). 

Lead Time: P11 order arrived in P14 (L=3), and L fluctuates 2-3. We set L=3 explicitly to ensure coverage. 

Demand: P15 demand spiked to 142, breaking the cooling trend (P11-P14 avg ~82). This suggests a return to volatility or the high regime (avg ~125). We adopt a service-biased forecast (avg ~110) to prevent stockouts given the 4:1 profit-to-holding ratio. 

Parameter Strategy: The system overestimates our position by 217 units. To trigger the necessary replenishment, we inflate mu_hat. Target Real Base Stock (for L=3+1 coverage) \u2248 110 * 4 + safety \u2248 500. We add the 217 phantom offset to the forecast. mu_hat = 440 (demand) + 217 (phantom) \u2248 660. This forces the backend to order enough to restore real coverage to ~4-5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 217 units (Orders P2 & P6 lost). Demand volatility active: P15 spike (142) broke recent cooling trend, suggesting potential return to high regime. Lead time persists at ~3 periods (P11 arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: On-hand low (118) vs recent demand volatility (P15: 142, P16: 108). 'In-transit' shows 440, but valid pipeline is only 223 (P16 order) because 217 units (from P2 and P6) are lost phantom inventory. Observed lead time is consistently 3 periods (P13 order arrived P16). To compensate for the 217 phantom units and cover the L=3 (L+1=4) horizon, I am using explicit parameters. Estimated real demand ~120/period leads to a horizon demand of ~480. Adding the 217 gap yields ~697. Setting mu_hat=700 forces the engine to order ~142 units (700 target - 558 system pipeline), replenishing consumption while maintaining the offset. Used recent_N=5 for sigma to capture recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 217 units (Orders P2 & P6 lost). Lead time stable at 3 periods (P13 arrived P16). Demand remains volatile/high (avg ~125 across P15-P16) compared to prior cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 18. Pattern update: Demand remains high and volatile (P17 demand 148, P15 demand 142), significantly above historical averages. Lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 period (P16 order arrived P17) and 3 periods (P13 order arrived P16). Phantom inventory of 217 units (lost orders P2 & P6) persists in the system's 'in-transit' count (412 total observed vs 195 valid from P17), which artificially suppresses replenishment. To compensate, mu_hat is set explicitly to cover 3 periods of high demand (~135/period * 3 = 405) plus the phantom offset (217), totaling ~622 (rounded to 650 for safety). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 80 to buffer against the observed lead time variance and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: alternating between 1 period (P17 arrival) and 3 periods (P16 arrival). Demand volatility persists in high regime (peaks of 142-148 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19. Start of P19 shows on-hand 84, in-transit 525. However, strict audit of 'conclude' messages confirms 217 units (Orders P2 & P6) are lost 'phantom' inventory. Valid in-transit is only 308 (Orders P17, P18), making real inventory position 392 (critically low). Recent demand (P15-18) is high and volatile (avg ~127, peaks ~148), and lead times fluctuate significantly (L=1 to L=3). To compensate for the 217 phantom units and ensure coverage for the volatile 3-period risk horizon, we artificially increase parameter L to 5. This forces the base stock target to ~800, generating an order of ~160 (capped) to replenish real safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand High/Volatile: P15-P18 avg ~127 with peaks to 148. Lead Time instability persists (P16 observed L=3, P17 observed L=1). Phantom inventory remains 217 units (Orders P2 & P6) requiring permanent offset.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 20. Status: On-hand 22, In-transit 687. 

Phantom Inventory Analysis:
- Order P2 (121) is lost (18 periods old).
- Order P6 (96) is lost (14 periods old).
- Total confirmed phantom inventory = 217 units.
- Recent shipments have been arriving (P16 arrived P17, L=1). The 'In-transit' figure of 687 includes these 217 lost units. We must offset the base stock to compensate, effectively treating the pipeline as 217 units smaller than reported.

Lead Time Analysis:
- Recent arrivals: P16 arrived P17 (L=1), P13 arrived P16 (L=3), P11 arrived P14 (L=3). 
- The lead time is highly volatile, swinging between 1 and 3 periods.
- Setting L=3 is safer to buffer against the longer delays observed recently.

Demand Analysis:
- Demand is volatile but recently high. Sample history: P15=142, P16=108, P17=148, P18=109, P19=62.
- The drop in P19 (62) is significant but follows a very high peak (148). It's risky to react too quickly to a single low point given the high variance.
- Recent 5-period average (P15-P19) is ~114 units.
- We need to maintain a robust base stock to cover the L=3 periods plus review period (Total 4 periods coverage).

Strategy:
- Use L=3 explicitly to handle the worst-case lead time.
- Use explicit mu_hat equal to mean demand (approx 115) * (1+L) + Phantom_Offset.
- Target Base Stock ~ (115 * 4) + Safety Stock ~ 460 + SS.
- BUT, the backend subtracts the FULL pipeline (687). 
- Real Pipeline = 687 - 217 = 470.
- Backend calculation: Order = BaseStock - 687.
- To order correctly, we need BaseStock - 687 = True_Target - 470.
- Therefore, BaseStock parameter must be = True_Target + (687 - 470) = True_Target + 217.
- Let's estimate True_Target (mu during L+1): Average demand ~115. L=3. mu_during_lead = 115 * 4 = 460. 
- Plus safety stock handled by sigma.
- We will set mu_hat explicitly to (4 periods * 115 avg) + 217 phantom offset = 460 + 217 = 677.
- Sigma_hat: High volatility (std dev of recent ~33). We'll trust the backend's 'recent_N' calculation on 5 samples to capture this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 217 units (Orders P2 & P6 lost). Lead time volatility persists (swings between 1 and 3 periods). Demand highly variable (62 to 148 range in last 5 periods).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 Context: Stockout occurred in Period 20. Demand remains volatile (last 5 avg ~106). Lead time instability is critical: Order P17 (195 units) has not arrived after 3 full periods (ordered P17, P20 conclude shows 0 arrivals), exceeding the observed max lead time of 3 periods. I am classifying P17 as lost alongside the previous lost orders P2 and P6 to prevent extended stockouts. Total phantom inventory = 217 (P2+P6) + 195 (P17) = 412 units. System in-transit is 713, but effective pipeline is only ~301. To compensate, I am setting explicit parameters. L=3 reflects the slow tail. mu_hat is set to 852 (covering 4 periods of demand ~440 + 412 phantom units). This ensures the base stock calculation triggers a replenishment order despite the inflated 'in-transit' number.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory increased to 412 units: P17 order (195 units) confirmed overdue (>3 periods) and likely lost, joining P2 and P6. Lead time reliability remains poor (variable 1-3 periods, now potentially >3 or lost).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 update: We face a critical stockout (On-hand 0) with highly unreliable supply. Order P17 (195 units) is confirmed lost (4+ periods elapsed). Order P18 (113 units) is overdue (ordered P18, not arrived by end of P21, L>3), and given recent loss patterns, it is treated as lost 'phantom' inventory to trigger replacement. Total phantom inventory is now 525 units (P2:121 + P6:96 + P17:195 + P18:113). Demand is volatile (avg ~106, peaks ~148). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to coverage (L+1=4 periods * 106 avg = 424) plus the full phantom offset (525) = 949, to force the backend to re-order the missing units immediately. Lead time L set to 3 to reflect the recurrent delays. Sigma increased to 65 to buffer against 150-unit demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory escalated to 525 units: P17 (195 units) confirmed lost (>4 periods), P18 (113 units) overdue (>3 periods) and presumed lost. Lead time remains unstable/loss-prone. Demand avg ~106 with high volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Major adjustment for accumulated lost orders. Orders P17 (195), P18 (113), and P19 (162) have all exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (P19 ordered Period 19, now Period 23 start with no arrival). Together with P2 and P6, total phantom inventory is 687 units (System: 1004 vs Actual: 317). To force the backend to re-order despite this false pipeline, I am setting mu_hat = (Demand 105 * 3) + 687 offset = 1002.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory escalated to 687 units: P19 (162 units) confirmed lost (>3 periods late) joining P2, P6, P17, P18. Shipping reliability is critical failure point. Demand stable ~105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 Analysis: A massive arrival wave in Period 23 (Orders P20, P21, P22) confirmed that the shipping channel has 'unclogged' with lead times varying from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2). However, this arrival pattern skipped Orders P17, P18, and P19 entirely, confirming they are LOST along with P2 and P6. 

Phantom Inventory Calculation: Total Reported In-Transit (728) - Valid P23 Order (41) = 687 Phantom Units (Lost Orders: P2[121] + P6[96] + P17[195] + P18[113] + P19[162] = 687). 

Real Inventory Position: On-hand (210) + Valid Pipeline (41) = 251 units. With steady demand ~106/period, this covers only ~2.3 periods (barely safe). We need to boost real supply to ~4 periods of coverage (~420 units) to account for volatility. 

Target Order Calculation: To reach a real position of ~413 units (ordering ~162 units now), we must offset the 687 phantom units. System Calculation: Order = Target - (On-hand 210 + Phantom 687 + Valid 41). Desired Order 162 = Target - 938 -> Target approx 1100. I set mu_hat explicitly to 1100 to force this correction.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 lost) after P20-P22 arrived in P23. Shipping reliability stabilized (L=1-3). Demand steady ~106.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Phantom inventory remains confirmed at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 lost). Recent arrivals (P20-P22) confirm shipping is active with L varying 1-3 periods. Demand is stable ~105. To compensate for the 687 lost units that the system wrongly counts as inventory, we must inflate mu_hat significantly. Target base stock needs to be ~450 (real demand coverage) + 687 (offset) = ~1140. Setting explicit mu_hat to 1150 forces the necessary replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 lost). Recent shipping reliability improved (Period 23 arrivals showed L=1, 2, 3 mix). Demand steady ~105.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Phantom inventory remains at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 lost). Use explicit mu_hat to offset this invisible deficit: Real In-transit is 333 vs System 1020. Recent demand avg ~108 (uptick to 125 in P25). Target real coverage for ~4 periods (L=2 to 3 variability) is approx 460 units. Total explicit target = 460 (real need) + 687 (phantom) = 1147. Rounding to 1150. L kept default as arrivals P20-P23 confirm L~2 average.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 lost). Shipping reliability improved (P20-P23 arrived with L=1-3). Demand uptick P25 (125) vs recent avg ~105.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27. Stockout occurred in Period 26. Phantom inventory remains high at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 confirmed lost), causing the system to grossly overestimate valid supply (reported 1137 vs valid 450). Order P24 (203 units) is late (promised 2 periods, now entering period 3) but not yet confirmed lost. To compensate for the 687 unit phantom gap and effectively order ~113 units (covering avg demand 105 + safety), we set mu_hat explicitly to 1250 (Target Base Stock ~ 1250 - 1137 pipeline = 113 order). Demand remains volatile (dip to 80 in P26) but recent average ~105 dictates aggressive replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 lost). P24 order (203 units) pending but late (>2 periods). Demand volatility continues (P26=80 vs P25=125), avg ~105.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit shows 1267, but ~890 units are likely lost/phantom (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and likely P24). Real pipeline is only ~377. To overcome this massive false inventory signal and force a replenishment order for the next 4 periods (L=3 assumed), we explicitly set mu_hat to 1710 (Target Coverage 440 + Phantom Offset 1270).

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed at 687 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). P24 (203 units) is now >3 periods late and likely lost, potentially raising phantom count to 890. Effective pipeline is critically lower than system report.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 analysis: On-hand is 0, but a massive order of 464 units was placed in Period 28, correcting for previous stockouts. The system reports 1614 units in-transit, but my analysis confirms ~1020 of these are 'phantom' (lost) orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The remaining active pipeline is ~594 units (Orders P27, P28), which is sufficient to cover expected demand (~110/period) for the next 5 periods. Since reliable coverage exceeds the demand over lead time (L+1=3 periods requires ~330 units), no new order is needed immediately. I will set parameters based on recent valid demand (avg ~111) to allow the high system inventory count to naturally suppress accurate ordering for now.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory escalated to 1020 units: Orders P24 (203 units) and P25 (130 units) confirmed lost as P26 (L=2) arrived in Period 28, skipping them. Total lost orders: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25. Real pipeline is ~594 units (P27, P28). Shipping reliability improved recently (P26 L=2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is volatile (avg ~110 over last 5 periods). Phantom inventory is confirmed at 1020 units (lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), inflating the system's in-transit view to 1484. However, the real pipeline contains a substantial order from Period 28 (464 units), bringing the actual inventory position to ~496 units (On-hand 32 + Real Pipe 464). This provides robust coverage (~4.5 periods of demand) against the target base stock of ~420. Consequently, no new order is needed. Using recent statistics permits the system to correctly calculate a zero order due to the high (phantom-inflated) inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 1020 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25 lost). Lead time stabilized at 2 periods (P26, P27 arrivals). Real pipeline (P28 alone = 464 units) is significant, allowing a temporary hold on ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Current on-hand is a healthy 409 units. Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (Period 28 order arrived in Period 30). The critical issue remains the massive 'Phantom Inventory' of 1020 units (accumulated lost orders) which the system incorrectly sees as 'In-transit'. The system calculates Position = 409 (real) + 1020 (phantom) = 1429. To trigger necessary replenishment orders, we must artificially inflate the Target used by the OR engine. We set 'mu_hat' to 1500. This effectively creates a target base stock of ~1530 (including safety). The resulting order calculation is approximately 1530 - 1429 = 101 units. This maintains real pipeline flow to prevent stock draining down to zero in ~4 periods. 'sigma_hat' is set explicitly low to make the target predictable.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 1020 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25 lost). Lead time stable at 2 periods (P28 order arrived P30). Demand showing signs of cooling (P29-P30 avg 92.5 vs P26-P28 avg 109).

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 32. On-hand is 264. System 'in-transit' is 1108, but verified phantom inventory is 1020 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), leaving only 88 units (P31 order) as real pipeline. Effective Inventory Position is 264 + 88 = 352. Recent demand spiked to 145 in P31 (avg ~115), breaking the cooling trend. To maintain service with L=2 (3 periods coverage), target real inventory should be ~500 units (conservative coverage for high volatility). This requires a System Base Stock of 500 + 1020 (phantom) = 1520. With (1+L)=3, we set mu_hat ~ 510 to force the backend to order approx 150 units, bridging the gap created by lost orders and recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P31 (145 units) interrupted cooling trend; volatility remains high. Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 1020 units. Real pipeline is only P31 order (88 units). Lead time stabilized at 2 periods (recent arrivals L=2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current system inventory position is artificially inflated to 1261 units (241 on-hand + 1020 lost 'phantom' units from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Real valid pipeline is 0 units (P31 order arrived in P32). To trigger a necessary replenishment order, we must use an explicit mu_hat that exceeds the phantom inventory count. Recent demand is high/volatile (~115 avg, peak 145). Target coverage for 3 periods (L=2 + R=1) is approx 360 units. Required Base Stock \u2248 1261 (position) + 120 (gap) \u2248 1380+. Setting mu_hat=1400 forces an order of ~140 units, restoring valid pipeline coverage.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 1020 units. Real pipeline empty (P31 arrived P32, L=1). Demand high/volatile (P31 145, P32 111).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Phantom inventory remains confirmed at 1020 units (System In-Transit 1192 vs Real Pipeline 172 from Period 33). This discrepancy is due to accumulated lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25). To generate a replenishment order despite the backend seeing 1192 incoming, I must inflate mu_hat by the phantom amount (1020). Normal demand for 3 periods (Review=1 + L=2) is approx 345 units (115 avg * 3). Target mu_hat = 345 + 1020 = ~1365. I will set mu_hat to 1400 to ensure a robust top-up order (~114 units) creating ~3.6 periods of real coverage. Recent lead times have improved to 1-2 periods (Period 31 order arrived in P32, L=1), but I maintain L=2 for safety given historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 1020 units. Recent shipping remarkably fast: Period 31 order arrived in 1 period (L=1), following a stable L=2 streak. Demand averaging ~112 recently but remains volatile with spikes (P31=145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $354.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
System reports 1307 units in-transit, but 1020 of these are phantom inventory (lost orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Effective pipeline is only 287 units (Orders P33 & P34). Current on-hand is critical (38 units), relying on P33 arriving in Period 35. To trigger a necessary replenishment order of ~120 units despite the inflated system inventory count, mu_hat is explicitly adjusted to offsets the phantom inventory. Target Base Stock ~1464 (1345 system inventory + 119 order).

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 1020 units. Real pipeline consists of Orders P33 (172) & P34 (115). Shipping times reliable at 1-2 periods. Demand volatility continues (~98-145 range).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Phantom inventory remains at 1020 units (System In-transit 1427 - Valid Pipeline 407). Valid pipeline (orders P33(late), P34, P35) totals 407 units, sufficient to cover expected demand (~115/period) for Periods 36-38 with a minimal buffer. We must order now to cover Period 39 demand. To induce an optimal order of ~100 units despite the phantom inventory bloat, we set Target = System Pipeline (1427) + Desired Order (103) = 1530. We use explicit mu_hat=1530 and low sigma_hat to set this deterministic base stock.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory stable at 1020 units. Lead time instability returned: P33 order (172 units) failed to arrive on promised L=2 (now L>=3), contrasting with recent reliable shipping (P31 L=1). Demand averaging ~113 (last 5 periods).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Critical Update: Order P33 (172 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P34 arrival in Period 36). Total phantom inventory is now 1192 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). System reports 1424 in-transit, but real pipeline is only 232 units (Orders P35, P36). With on-hand at 0 and demand trending high (avg ~109, P36=123), stockout risk is severe. We must offset the 1192 phantom units and order ~220 real units to cover the L+1 period service gap. Setting 'explicit' mu_hat to 1640 (Target Base Stock ~1640 > System Position 1424) to trigger this replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory escalated to 1192 units: Order P33 (172 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P34 arrival). Real pipeline is just 232 units (P35, P36). Demand stronger (P36=123), avg ~109. Shipping reliability L=2 restored for survivor P34, but loss rate remains high.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Phantom inventory has reached ~1364 units (System In-Transit 1434 vs Real Pipeline 70-242). Order P33 (172) is confirmed lost as later orders arrived. The backend sees 1583 units of stock (On-Hand + In-Transit) and will order 0 unless we offset the ghosts. Recent real demand is ~105. We need real coverage of ~350 units. Therefore, we set 'explicit' mu_hat to 1800 (Phantom 1364 + Real Need ~436) to force the base stock calculation high enough to trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory escalated to 1364 units: Order P33 (172 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P34 and P36 arrivals). Real pipeline is only the P37 order (242 units). System in-transit (1434) is 95% ghost inventory. Recent shipping is fast (L=1-2) but loss risk remains high.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: On-hand is 39, In-transit reported is 1683. After analyzing the history, I've corrected the phantom inventory count to 1192 units (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33 confirmed lost). This means the 'real' pipeline is 491 units (Orders P37 and P38). Combined with on-hand, valid inventory is 530 units. With recent demand averaging ~105-110 units, we have approximately 5 periods of coverage (through Period 43). Given this ample coverage, no new order is needed. I will set parameters to reflect recent demand statistics; the system's inflated inventory view (1722 units) vs a normal base stock (~350) will naturally result in an order of 0, which is the desired action to prevent further overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Correction: Phantom inventory verified at 1192 units (P38 insight double-counted P33). Lost orders: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33. Real pipeline consists of Orders P37 (242) and P38 (249). Valid effective stock (530 units) provides ~5 period coverage, justifying an ordering pause.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Period_40): P38 (ordered P38) arrived in P39 with L=1, appearing before P37 (ordered P37, L=2 promised). System in-transit is 1434 units. Previous verified phantom inventory was 1192. Adding the overdue/skipped P37 order (242 units) to phantom inventory results in exactly 1434 units (1192 + 242). This confirms P37 is effectively lost/phantom, and the REAL pipeline is 0 units. Current on-hand (195) is critically low against 3 periods of demand (Order P40 arrives P42/visible P43). We face a potential stockout in P42. I must order immediately to replenish. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the 1434 phantom units) to order ~160 units (Target 355 - OnHand 195), I will use an explicit mu_hat that offsets the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock ~ 1600 (1434 + ~166). mu_hat set to 1575 to achieve this order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory escalated to 1434 units: Order P37 (242 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P38 arrival L=1). Total lost orders: P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37. Real pipeline is 0 units. System in-transit is 100% ghost inventory. P38 arrival suggests L=1 is possible, but reliability is mixed.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Critical Context: System In-Transit inventory (1434 units) is confirmed as 100% phantom/lost stock (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37). Real pipeline is 0 units. With On-hand at 104 units and demand averaging ~95-100, stockout risk is imminent in Period 42 without immediate replenishment. Strategy: Using 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 1434 phantom units and force an order. Target Real Base Stock ~350 units (covering L=2 + review + safety). Calculation: 1434 (phantom) + 350 (target) = 1784. This should trigger an order of roughly 1784 - (104 + 1434) = 246 units. Recent arrivals (L=1) suggest valid orders may arrive quickly, but loss risk remains high.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 0 units. Order P38 arrived in 1 period (L=1), continuing recent trend of fast delivery for surviving orders. Demand stable ~95 (P39-40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 demand context: Significant cooling trend observed; Period 41 demand (64) is the lowest since Period 19, pulling the 5-period average down to ~88. Phantom inventory remains 1434 units; Order P37 (242 units) is confirmed lost as P38 (L=1, 249 units) arrived, skipping it. Real effective pipeline is 277 units (Order P41). On-hand (40) + Real Pipeline (277) = 317 units available, covering the next 3 periods of expected demand (~264 units). We use explicit parameters to offset the massive phantom inventory, but the resulting logic correctly suggests a pause in ordering to avoid overstock given the P41 replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 277 units (Period 41 order). Demand dropping significantly: Period 41 (64 units) is lowest in 20 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Phantom inventory is 1434 units (confirmed lost orders). Total reported pipeline is 1711, meaning valid pipeline is 277 (Order P41). Current demand is very low (65 units/period), so the valid pipeline covers >4 periods of demand. No order is needed. I will use recent_N parameters which, combined with the inflated reported pipeline, will correctly result in a 0 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand dropped significantly (P41=64, P42=65), lowest levels in >20 periods. Phantom inventory remains stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline (Order P41, 277 units) provides >4 periods of coverage at current low demand, suggesting no immediate need to force orders despite system pipeline inflation.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a historically low regime (approx 64 units/period over P41-P43). Order P41 (277 units) failed to arrive in Period 43 (missing the L=2 promised window) and is now delayed (L>=3). However, if P41 arrives, it provides >4 periods of coverage at current low demand rates. System in-transit (1711) is inflated by 1434 units of confirmed phantom inventory. Given the massive system inventory surplus relative to the low target base stock, the system will not order, which is acceptable as we await the resolution of P41. Parameters are updated to reflect the new low-demand statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand Low Regime confirmed: P41-P43 avg ~64 (lowest historical). Phantom inventory stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 277 units (Order P41), which is late (failed L=2 arrival in P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
CONTEXT: We are in Period 45 of 50. A distinct 'Low Demand' regime has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P41-P44: 64, 65, 62, 68; avg ~65), significantly down from the prior ~110 avg. PIPELINE: On-hand is 209 units. Order P41 finally arrived in P44 (L=3). System 'in-transit' is 1434, but phantom inventory remains stable at 1434 units (accounting for lost orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37). Thus, REAL pipeline = 0 units. ACTION: Total valid stock is 209 (on-hand) + 0 (pipeline) = 209. At current demand (~65), this covers ~3.2 periods (P45, P46, P47). Since the game ends at P50 and lead times can be 3 periods, we need to ensure coverage through P50. A conservative top-up is prudent now to cover the final periods without overstocking. I will set mu_hat to match the recent low average (65) and use L=3 to reflect the recent slow arrival of P41, ensuring the system orders enough to cover the lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand Low Regime confirmed stable: P41-P44 avg ~65 (vs historic high >110). Lead time risk remains: P41 order took 3 periods. Phantom inventory stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is effectively zero.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 analysis: Demand rebounded sharply in Period 45 (116 units) after a 4-period low lull (avg 64.7), suggesting a return to the historically dominant high regime (avg ~110). Lead time risk persists; P41 order arrived in Period 44 (L=3), confirming variability (history shows L=1 to L=3). System 'in-transit' is 1434 units, but analysis confirms ALL are phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37). The real pipeline is effectively 0 (since P41 arrived and P42-45 had 0 orders). To compensate for the 1434 phantom units and replenish real inventory for the demand resurgence, 'mu_hat' is explicitly set to 1800. This targets a Base Stock of ~1800+safety, triggering a real order of ~300 units (1800 - 93 OH - 1434 Phantom) to cover ~3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery: Period 45 (116 units) signals end of low regime. Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 0. Lead time P41->P44 was 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 Context: Demand has recently shown volatile swings. After a distinct 'Low Regime' (P41-P43 avg ~64), demand spiked to 116 in P45 before moderating to 81 in P46. This suggests the low regime was temporary and we have returned to a higher, more volatile baseline (likely averaging ~90-100). 

Inventory Status: Starting On-hand is 12 units (Period 46 ending). System 'in-transit' is 1740 units, but this number is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were lost in transit but never removed from the system count. 

Phantom Inventory Calculation: 
Accumulated lost orders: P2(121), P6(96), P17(195), P18(113), P19(162), P24(203), P25(130), P33(172), P37(242). 
Total Phantom units = 121 + 96 + 195 + 113 + 162 + 203 + 130 + 172 + 242 = 1434 units.

Effective Pipeline: 
Total In-transit (1740) - Phantom (1434) = 306 units. 
This corresponds exactly to the single order placed in Period 46 (306 units).

Action Plan:
1. Lead Time: Recent successful delivery (P41->P44) took 3 periods. Earlier ones were faster (1-2), but given the history of losses and delays, calculating a robust average is safer than assuming the promised 2 periods.
2. Demand Forecast (mu_hat): The recent dip to ~64 was broken by P45's 116. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 captures the mix of the low dip and the recent recovery (P42-P46: 65, 62, 68, 116, 81), providing a balanced recovery estimate without overreacting to the single spike.
3. Volatility (sigma_hat): Demand is unstable. A broader history (N=10) helps smooth the volatility estimation.
4. Pipeline Offset: We must compensate for the 1434 phantom units. We achieve this by artificially inflating our demand forecast (mu_hat) by adding the phantom quantity to the 'explicit' calculation, or simply trusting the backend to re-order if we set parameters correctly? 
Correction: The most effective way to 'ignore' phantom inventory in this specific backend (which subtracts full pipeline from target) is to inflate the base stock target. Since I cannot directly set base_stock, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a target that equals: (Real Expected Demand during L+1) + Phantom Inventory. 
Target Base Stock approx = (Real Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom. 
Using 'explicit' mu_hat = (Real Mean * (1+L)) + 1434.

Calculation for Explicit Mu:
Estimated L = 2.5 (avg of recent). Review period = 1. Total coverage = 3.5 periods.
Real Mean Demand (last 5 periods) = approx 78.4.
Base Demand Component = 78.4 * 3.5 \u2248 274.
Add Phantom Inventory = 1434.
Total Explicit Mu = 274 + 1434 = 1708.

However, the backend formula is: base_stock = mu + z*sigma. If I put 1708 into mu, base_stock becomes ~1708 + safety. The system then computes: Order = Base_Stock - (On_Hand + Total_In_Transit). 
Order = (1708 + safety) - (12 + 1740) = negative number. 
Wait, Total In-Transit (1740) = Real (306) + Phantom (1434).
So Order = (Real_Target + Phantom) - (On_Hand + Real_Pipeline + Phantom) 
Order = Real_Target - On_Hand - Real_Pipeline.
The Phantoms cancel out! 
Thus, providing an explicit mu_hat that *include* the phantom inventory is the correct strategy to nullify the backend's deduction of those lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Low regime (P41-44 avg ~64) ended with P45 spike (116) and P46 moderation (81). Phantom inventory remains stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 306 units (Order P46). Lead time currently unstable (recent arrival P44 was L=3).

Demand has spiked back to high levels (P47=127). On-hand is 0. System reports 1740 in-transit but 1434 are lost; real pipeline is only 306 units (P46). We set parameters to react to the recent high demand (N=3) and variable lead times (N=5) to prevent stockouts in the final 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: High volatility returned (Period 47: 127 units) following the brief dip. Phantom inventory remains stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is only Order P46 (306 units). Recent lead time (P41) was 3 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. Real pipeline contains only Order P46 (306 units), which is past promised lead time (2 periods) but aligns with the recent L=3 observation from Period 41. If P46 arrives this period (L=3), it provides 306 units against remaining ~200 units of expected demand (Periods 49-50), fully covering needs. System 'in-transit' (1740) includes 1434 units of confirmed phantom inventory. Due to this massive ghost inventory and the sufficient real pipeline, no new order is required (or possible without extreme manipulation). We maintain standard forecasting parameters to reflect the volatile demand regime (avg ~95) while accepting the system will calculate zero order.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 306 units (Order P46), currently late (L=2 exceeded) but expected L=3. Demand remains volatile (83-127 range).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: Demand volatility is extreme (83-135 range recently). The critical issue remains the massive pile of 'phantom inventory'. The system reports 1740 units 'in-transit', but 1434 of these belong to orders confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37). The only valid pipeline order is from Period 46 (306 units), which is now late (today is Period 50, ordered Period 46, Promised L=2 -> 4 periods elapsed). Given the recent history of L=3 arrivals (P44 arrival of P41 order), P46 might arrive now, but it is at high risk of being lost given the pattern. If P46 is lost, the real pipeline is ZERO. I will assume P46 is effectively lost or unreliable and set parameters to force a re-order to cover demand. To 'pierce' the cloud of 1740 phantom units, I must project a demand that exceeds (Phantom + OnHand)/(1+L) or use explicit parameters. However, the simulation limits me to mu/sigma manipulation. The most robust way to trigger an order when the pipeline is falsely inflated is to set 'L' to 'explicit' with a high value (diluting the phantom stock perception) or careful mu management. Actually, the backend formula subtracts pipeline. If pipeline is 1740 and base stock is ~300, order is 0. I cannot force an order easily unless I set mu/sigma extremely high, or rely on the system eventually writing off lost orders (which it hasn't). Wait, checking lost orders mechanics: if they never arrive, they stay in valid pipeline forever in this game engine unless I compensate. The only way to compensate for 1434 phantom units is to increase the Desired Base Stock by 1434 units. Base Stock = mu + z*sigma. I need Base Stock > 1740 (phantom) + Real Demand. This requires a massive explicit boost to mu_hat. Real demand is ~100/period. Target stock ~300. Gap is 1434. I will add 1450 to my explicit forecast for mu_hat. Normal demand (1+L)*110 approx 330. I need to set mu_hat to ~1800 to offset the phantom inventory. Let's try explicit mu_hat = 1900 to be safe and ensure restocking.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed stable at 1434 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33, P37 lost). Real pipeline is 306 units (Order P46), which is now overdue (4 periods since order) and likely lost or arriving very late. Major parameter intervention required to offset persistent phantom inventory.
