  "rationale": "I am in Period 1. I control 'chips(Regular)' with a Profit/Holding cost ratio of $4/$1 = 4.0. This high ratio suggests a strategy that prioritizes stocking enough inventory to capture sales, as the penalty for lost sales ($4) is significantly higher than holding a unit ($1). \n\n**Demand Forecasting:**\nSince this is Period 1, I have no immediate local history for this specific run. I must rely on the provided 'Historical Demand Data' samples: [100, 69, 92, 77, 111].\n- Mean: (100+69+92+77+111)/5 = 89.8\n- Std Dev: Approx 15-20.\n- Max seen: 111.\n\nWithout calendar dates, I assume a standard demand distribution based on these samples. I will target a stock level sufficient to cover demand during the lead time plus the review period.\n\n**Lead Time & Pipeline:**\n- Promised Lead Time: 2 periods.\n- Current On-hand: 0.\n- Current In-transit: 0.\n\nBecause the lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 3 (arrival resolution phase). It will be available to satisfy demand in Period 3. However, I need to cover Period 3 specifically with this order, as demand in Period 1 and Period 2 will be lost or unmet (since I start with 0 stock and lead time > 0).\n\nWait, strictly speaking:\n- Order P1 -> Arrives during P3.\n- Stock available for demand in P3.\n- P1 and P2 demand: I have 0 stock. I cannot fulfill this. \n\nMy decision today (Order P1) determines my starting inventory for Period 3. I also need to think about pipeline for periods beyond that. In standard base-stock policy:\nTarget Level = (Lead Time + 1) * Avg Demand + Safety Stock.\nSince I have 0 inventory and 0 in-transit currently, I am effectively ordering to fill the pipeline for the first available moment of sales (Period 3) and perhaps Period 4 if I stack orders, but let's focus on getting a healthy pipeline started.\n\nTo be safe and cover the potential for higher demand (like the 111 observation) over the lead time interval once arrivals start:\nTarget for 1 period of coverage = ~90-100 units.\nBuying for the pipeline (Period 3 coverage): The order I place now is likely the *only* stock available for Period 3. I should order enough to cover a potentially high demand period in P3.\n\nLet's aim for a quantity that covers the mean + safety buffer. \nTarget = Mean + z*sigma. Using the max of historical data (111) is a safe upper bound given the high profit margin. Let's start with a robust order to fill the pipeline immediately.\n\nBase Stock logic for L=2:\nI need to cover demand for Period 3 (when it arrives) and account for the fact I'll place another order in P2 for P4. \nSo, Order P1 = Forecast(P3).\nBased on history, 90-100 is the average. 111 is max. Given 4:1 cost ratio, I'll order slightly aggressively to ensure I don't stock out once stock arrives. Let's order 110 units.",

The provided historical sample data suggests a range of ~70-110 units (Mean ~90). \n\nGoal: Cover demand for the review period (Period 2) + lead time (Period 3, Period 4). We need to cover P2, P3, P4. However, Period 2 demand is about to happen and we have 0 stock, so sales will be lost. The order placed now (Period 2) will arrive in Period 2 + 2 = Period 4. \n\nPipeline check:\n- Period 2 demand: ~90 (will be lost, on-hand 0).\n- Period 3 demand: ~90. Expected arrival: 110 (Order from P1). Net inventory end of P3 ~ 20.\n- Period 4 demand: ~90. Need stock to cover this. Net inventory from P3 is ~20. Deficit ~70.\n\nSince profit ($4) is high relative to holding cost ($1), we should target a high service level. The historical samples show demand can spike to ~110. A safer forecast is ~100 units/period.\n\nCalculation for Period 4 coverage:\nTotal need for P3+P4 (since P2 is lost) = ~200 units.\nIncoming P1 order (arriving P3) = 110 units.\nRemaining need = 200 - 110 = 90 units.\nTo maintain safety stock for Period 5 (start), we might add buffers.

Volatility is moderate. 4x holding cost margin justifies safety stock. Let's aim for 120 (approx 95th percentile) coverage per future period.\nWe need to cover Period 4 demand via this order. Period 3 is covered by the 110 in transit (110 > 90 avg). We likely end P3 with 20 units. We need cover for P4 (100) + P5 buffer. Order size around 110-120 seems appropriate to replenish the cycle.

The spike in P2 (124) was followed by a dip in P3 (85), closer to historical average. The carry-over insight noted elevated demand (~116), but the new datapoint (85) pulls the average down slightly. I will forecast demand using a blend of recent observations and historical samples, estimating ~100 units/period to be safe but not overstocked given the $1 holding cost. \n\nStep 2: Check Lead Time. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (110). If LT=2, P1 order arrives in P3. P3 conclude message says 'arrived=0'. This is concerning. It means the P1 order is late. It might arrive in P4 (LT=3) or be lost. We cannot confirm LT yet. \n\nStep 3: Inventory Position. On-hand: 0. In-transit: 380 (110 from P1 + 115 from P2 + 155 from P3).

The historical samples were [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] (avg ~90). The recent drop in P3 (85) and P4 (79) suggests demand might be stabilizing back towards the historical average after the initial high burst. We will assume a forecast around 90-95 units for upcoming periods.\n\n2.  **Lead Time Analysis**: \n    - Order P1 (110) arrived in P4. Lead time = 4 - 1 = 3 periods.\n    - Order P3 (155) arrived in P4. Lead time = 4 - 3 = 1 period.\n    - Order P2 (115) has NOT arrived yet. It was ordered in P2 and it is now the start of P5. Current duration = 3 periods. It is still in transit (115 units shown in 'In-transit'). If it arrives in P5, LT=3. This confirms high volatility in lead times (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods), making the supply chain unpredictable.\n\n3.  **Inventory & Pipeline Position**:\n    - On-hand: 186 units.\n    - In-transit: 115 units (Period 2 order).\n    - Total Supply: 186 + 115 = 301 units.\n\n4.  **Coverage Calculation**:\n    - Forecast ~95 units/period.\n    - Supply (301) covers approx 3.1 periods.\n    - Given the volatile lead time (up to 3 periods observed), we need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, 7, and likely 8 to be safe against stockouts (L+1 or L+2 coverage logic where L=3).\n    - Target coverage = 4 periods * 95 = 380 units.\n    - Shortfall = 380 - 301 = 79 units.\n\n5.  **Final Decision**: We have 186 on hand which easily covers P5 and likely P6.

Period 9 (Period_9) VM Action:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical data, here is the decision rationale and order execution for Period 9.

### Rationale

**1. Demand Analysis**
*   **Recent History:** Demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) has been: 79, 100, 98, 122, 121.
*   **Trend:** There is a clear upward trend in recent periods, with the last two periods averaging ~121.5 units, significantly higher than the earlier average of ~99 or the pre-game samples (~90).
*   **Forecast:** Given the sustained elevated demand in P7 and P8, I will forecast a demand of approx. 120 units per period.

**2. Supply Chain & Lead Time Diagnosis**
*   **Lead Time:** We have observed significant variance.
    *   P1 order arrived P4 (LT=3).
    *   P3 order arrived P4 (LT=1).
    *   P5 order arrived P8 (LT=3).
    *   P7 order arrived P8 (LT=1).
    *   **Conclusion:** Lead time oscillates between 1 and 3 periods. To be safe, we must plan for 3 periods.
*   **Lost Orders:** The Period 2 order of 115 units is still missing. It has been in transit for 7 periods (P2 to P9). It is confirmed lost.
*   **Pipeline Clean-up:**
    *   Displayed In-transit: 395 units.
    *   Less Lost Order (P2): 115 units.
    *   Less Orders Arrived in P8: The system subtracts arrivals *before* showing current status (P8 concluded arrivals were 80+125=205).
    *   Let's verify the active orders contributing to the 395 count.
    *   Orders placed:
        *   P1: 110 (Arrived P4)
        *   P2: 115 (LOST)
        *   P3: 155 (Arrived P4)
        *   P4: 0
        *   P5: 80 (Arrived P8)
        *   P6: 100 (Not yet arrived?)
        *   P7: 125 (Arrived P8)
        *   P8: 180 (New)
    *   Sum of *pending* orders (excluding lost P2):
        *   P6 (100) + P8 (180) = 280 units.
    *   Sum with lost P2: 280 + 115 = 395. Matches "In-transit: 395".
    *   **Effective In-transit:** 280 (P6 order + P8 order).

**3. Inventory Strategy (Order Calculation)**
*   **Current Stock:** 84 units.
*   **Effective Pipeline:** 280 units.
*   **Total Supply:** 84 + 280 = 364 units.
*   **Target Coverage:** We need to cover the lead time (conservatively 3 periods) + review period (1 period) = 4 periods.
*   **Target Inventory Level:** 4 periods * 120 units/period = 480 units.
*   **Gap:** 480 (Target) - 364 (On-hand + Effective In-transit) = 116 units.

**4. Final Decision**
*   To close the gap and protect against the recent demand surge (~122), ordering roughly 115-120 units is appropriate. I will order 120 to align with the new demand mean.

This is a highly efficient regime compared to earlier delays, but the risk of random loss remains.\n- In-transit Audit: The system reports 1265 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, a massive portion is 'phantom' (forever lost) inventory. Previously confirmed phantom stock was 1065 units (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30). \n- Verification: 1265 (Total) - 1065 (Known Phantom) = 200 units. The only active order is from Period 33 (200 units). This matches perfectly. The validity of the pipeline is high, consisting solely of the P33 order.\n\nDemand Analysis:\n- Recent demand: 98 (P29), 87 (P30), 145 (P31), 111 (P32), 105 (P33).\n- 3-period average: ~120 units. 5-period average: ~109 units.\n- The spike to 145 in P31 pushes the safety stock requirement higher, though P33 stabilized near the mean.\n\nInventory Strategy:\n- Current On-hand: 45 units.\n- Arriving soon (LT=1 expected): P33 order (200 units) should arrive in P34 (since P32 arrived in P33).\n- Expected Total Availability in P34 = 45 (on-hand) + 200 (arrival) = 245 units.\n- Expected Demand for P34: ~110-120 units.\n- Ending P34 Inventory Estimate: ~125-135 units.\n- Coverage Target: We need coverage for Period 35 demand (approx 120 units) + Safety Stock. \n- Gap: 125 (est carryover) is sufficient for one period of demand, but leaves little buffer if demand spikes to 145 again or if the order is delayed. \n- Decision: With LT=1, we are replenishing for Period 35 consumption. Projected P34 carryover (125) covers P35 base demand. To maintain a safety buffer of ~0.5 periods (60 units) against volatility, we order 60 units.

[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the analysis of the current situation for Period 36:

1.  **Demand Analysis:** The demand regime remains stable around ~105-110 units per period. Recent data points: P31(145 - outlier), P32(111), P33(105), P34(98), P35(107). The 5-period average is 113.2 (skewed by P31), but the median/mode behavior is closer to 105.

2.  **Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis:**
    *   **Successful Arrivals:** P31 and P32 orders arrived in 1 period.
    *   **In-Transit Discrepancies:**
        *   **P33 Order (200 units):** Ordered P33. Should have arrived P34 (if LT=1) or P35 (if LT=2). It did *not* arrive by P35 conclude. This is now technically overdue if we assume the recent LT=1 regime, but within the normal LT=2 promised window. However, given the *history* of skipped orders, the fact that P32 arrived in P33 but P33 hasn't arrived in P35 is concerning.
        *   **P34 Order (60 units):** Ordered P34. If LT=1, should have arrived P35. It did not.
        *   **P35 Order (120 units):** Just ordered.
    *   **Phantom Inventory Calculation:** The carry-over insight correctly identifies 1065 units of phantom inventory (P2+P6+P17+P18+P19+P24+P25+P29+P30).
    *   **In-Transit Count:** 1445 reported.
    *   **Effective Pipeline:** 1445 (Total) - 1065 (Known Phantom) = 380 units?
        *   Let's check the recent orders: P33(200) + P34(60) + P35(120) = 380 units.
        *   Wait, the math holds perfectly. The *entirety* of the in-transit pile that isn't known phantom inventory corresponds exactly to orders P33, P34, and P35.
        *   *Critical Risk:* P33 and P34 are currently *skipping* periods because P31/P32 arrived brilliantly fast (LT=1). P33 is now 2 periods old. P34 is 1 period old.

3.  **Inventory Position:**
    *   On-hand: 0.
    *   Incoming Risk: We have 0 stock. Demand is ~105. We need coverage for P36 (now), P37, and P38.
    *   Target coverage ~315 units.
    *   Pipeline (P33+P34+P35) = 380 units.
    *   IF these arrive in P36 (bulk arrival), we are fine (380 > 315).
    *   IF they are delayed/lost like previous batches, we will stock out again.
    *   Given P33 (200u) missed the P34 and P35 arrival windows (despite P32 arriving in 1 period), there is a risk it is "stuck" or lost. However, usually, we wait for LT > 3 to declare loss.
    *   Current gap: P33 (200) might arrive P36. P34 (60) might arrive P36. P35 (120) might arrive P37.

4.  **Decision Logic:**
    *   Demand is ~105.
    *   We have 0 on hand.
    *   We have 380 units in the "valid" pipeline.
    *   However, 260 of those (P33+P34) missed the "fast" LT=1 window.
    *   Total effective inventory position = 0 + 380 = 380.
    *   Target (Safety Stock + Demand during max lead time) = 110 * 3 = 330.
    *   We are technically *over* ordered (380 vs 330), but only because P33 (200 units) was a large catch-up order that hasn't arrived.
    *   If P33 arrives, we have plenty. If P33 is lost, we drop to 180 pipeline vs 330 need (deficit 150).
    *   Since P33 is only at "LT=3" duration *during* this period (ordered P33, current P36), we cannot assume it is lost yet. We must assume it arrives.
    *   However, with 0 on hand, we are vulnerable. A small "insuring" order helps if P33 is lost, but P35 (120) is already in the pipe.
    *   Let's hold off on a massive order and place a small maintenance order to keep the pipe flowing without overstocking if the "flush" happens. Actually, since our calculations show Position (380) > Target (330), we should order 0 or very small.
    *   BUT: We are stocking out *now*. Pipeline doesn't help P36 demand unless it arrives *in* P36.
    *   Let's act conservatively. If P33 is lost, we need replacement. But we won't know until next period or later.
    *   Calculation: Target inventory position = 330. Current Effective Position = 380. Overage = 50.
    *   Wait, P33 (200) + P34 (60) + P35 (120) = 380.
    *   If I order 0, and P33 (200) is lost, I am effectively at 180.
    *   Given the history of heavy losses (approx 50% of orders), hedging is wise.
    *   I will place a small order (e.g., 50-60) to account for potential loss of P34 or partial loss, but rely mostly on the big P33 order arriving. Actually, the pattern is often: Fast arrival -> Delay -> Loss.
    *   I'll order closer to demand mean (100) to ensure pipeline continuity, assuming P33 *might* be lost eventually, but I can't double-order yet. Actually, checking previous "phantom" accumulations: The system tends to deliver batches or lose them.
    *   Re-evaluating Pipeline: P33 (200) is the critical uncertainty. If it arrives, we have ~200 units surplus. If lost, we need stock.
    *   I will place an order for ~80 units. This keeps the pipe active without grossly overstocking if the 200 arrives.

Demand Analysis: The dip in P41 (64 units) and P42 (65 units) is unusual compared to the long-term average (~105), suggesting a potential low-demand variance or downward trend, but prudence requires planning for a return to mean (~100). Lead Time & Pipeline: A major discrepancy exists in 'In-transit'. Total reported is 1845, but 'Phantom Inventory' (accumulated lost orders) is estimated at 1665 units coming into P42. In P42 conclude, P40 order (160u) did not arrive despite P39 arriving in 1 period (LT=1). P40 is now 2 periods out (ordered P40, now P43 decision phase). P40 is NOT lost yet (max LT can be 3), but P37 (200u) is definitely lost as it was skipped by P38/P39 arrivals. The valid pipeline likely contains orders from P40, P41, P42. Let's recalculate phantom: Previous phantom (1465) + P37 (200) = 1665. Total In-transit (1845) - Phantom (1665) = 180 units? No, let's trace recent orders: P40(160) + P41(120) + P42(100) = 380. The math: 1845 - 380 = 1465. Wait, P37 was added to phantom in P42 insight. Let's re-verify the pipeline. Orders P40(160), P41(120), P42(100) are the only recent ones not conclusively lost or arrived. Total recent/valid = 380. Discrepancy: 1845 - 380 = 1465. This matches the phantom count entering P42 perfectly if P37 wasn't added yet, or if my manual sum is off. The insight saying P37 is added to phantom (1665 total) implies valid pipeline is 1845 - 1665 = 180. But orders P40, P41, P42 sum to 380. Therefore, P40 (160u) is effectively treated as lost by the math or there is a lag. Given P39 arrived in P40 (LT=1), P40 *should* have arrived in P41 or P42. It hasn't. It is likely delayed or lost.

Current demand is back in line with the long-term historical average (~105-115). Forecasting ~115 units for upcoming periods.\n\nLead Time & Pipeline: Recent arrivals (P42 LT=3, P43 LT=2) confirm lead times are stabilizing in the 2-3 period range. The reported In-transit (1545) minus the calculated Phantom Inventory (1465) leaves a valid pipeline of only 80 units (the P45 order). \n\nInventory Strategy (End-Game Horizon): With only ~5 periods left (game ends P50), I need to cover remaining demand (approx 575 units total for P46-P50) while minimizing leftover stock. Current assets (234 on-hand + 80 pipeline) = 314 units. This covers P46 and P47, but leaves a deficit for P48-P50. To cover P48 (risking stockout) and P49, and accounting for the lead time, I need to place a substantial order now. 150 units brings total supply to 464, roughly covering demand through P49.

Here is the decision for Period 47.

```json
{
  "rationale": "World Knowledge: N/A. \n\nDemand Analysis: Demand has rebounded from the suppression phase (P41-P44 avg ~65). P45 demand was 116, and P46 was 81. The average over the last 10 periods (excluding the suppression dip) is approximately 105. I will forecast ~100 units for the remaining 4 periods of the game (P47-P50).\n\nInventory & Pipeline Analysis:\n- On-hand: 153 units.\n- Total In-transit: 1695 units.\n- Phantom Inventory Calculation: Previous phantom estimate was 1465. Let's verify arrivals. \n- P45 arrivals included P42 (100u, LT=3) and P43 (100u, LT=2). The P44 order (0 units) irrelevant. The P45 order (80u) and P46 order (150u) are likely still in transit.\n- The pipeline effectively reset partially with P42/P43 arriving. \n- Let's trace valid orders since P44:\n  - P44 order: 0\n  - P45 order: 80\n  - P46 order: 150\n- Total 'Real' Pipeline expected: 80 + 150 = 230 units.\n- Phantom Inventory Check: Total In-transit (1695) - Real Pipeline (230) = 1465. This confirms the phantom inventory count is stable at 1465 units (accumulated lost orders).\n\nLead Time Analysis:\n- Recent arrivals (P45 conclude) showed LT=3 (P42) and LT=2 (P43). This confirms lead times are stabilizing around 2-3 periods, rather than the 1 period observed earlier or infinite loss.\n\n Order Logic:\n- Remaining Horizon: Periods 47, 48, 49, 50 (4 periods).\n- Total Expected Demand (P47-P50): ~100/period * 4 = 400 units.\n- Current Position: On-hand (153) + Real Pipeline (230) = 383 units.\n- Gap: 400 - 383 = 17 units.\n- Given the end of game is near, holding costs penalize excess stock. However, a small top-up ensures service through P50 (Stockout cost is implied high via lost profit). I will order enough to cover the slight gap and potential variance, aiming to end with near-zero stock.",

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical patterns, below is the reasoning and order decision for Period 48.

### **Rationale**

1.  **Demand Analysis (Rebound Confirmed):**
    *   The severe demand suppression seen in Periods 41-44 (avg ~65 units) has officially ended.
    *   Recent demand: Period 45 (116), Period 46 (81), Period 47 (127).
    *   The average over the last 3 periods is ~108 units.
    *   With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), I need to forecast based on this recovered baseline of ~108-110 units.

2.  **Inventory & Pipeline Assessment:**
    *   **Current On-Hand:** 26 units.
    *   **Total "In-Transit":** 1725 units. This number is grossly inflated by "phantom inventory"\u2014lost orders that never arrived.
    *   **Phantom Inventory Calculation:** Previous estimate was 1465. Let's verify the recent arrivals.
        *   In P45, P42 (100u) and P43 (100u) arrived.
        *   Did P44 (0u) arrive? N/A.
        *   Current valid pipeline should only contain orders placed *after* P43:
            *   P44 order: 0
            *   P45 order: 80
            *   P46 order: 150
            *   P47 order: 30
            *   **Total Valid Pipeline:** 260 units.
    *   **Phantom Verification:** Total In-Transit (1725) - Valid Pipeline (260) = 1465. The phantom count remains exactly 1465 units.
    *   **Effective Inventory Position:** On-Hand (26) + Valid In-Transit (260) = 286 units.

3.  **Lead Time Analysis:**
    *   Recent arrivals: P43 arrived in P45 (LT=2), P42 arrived in P45 (LT=3).
    *   P44 order was 0.
    *   P45 order (80u) has been in-transit for 2 full periods (P46, P47) and has not yet arrived (as of P47 conclude). It is due now or very soon.
    *   P46 order (150u) has been in-transit for 1 period.
    *   Lead time is operating around 2-3 periods.

4.  **End-Game Logic (Horizon = 50):**
    *   We need to cover demand for Period 48, 49, and 50.
    *   **Total Remaining Demand Forecast:** ~110 units/period * 3 periods = 330 units.
    *   **Current Coverage:** 286 units (Total Valid Position).
    *   **The Gap:** 330 - 286 = 44 units.
    *   **Timing:** An order placed now (P48) with LT=2 will arrive in Period 50. Since profit ($4) > holding ($1), it is worth fulfilling P50 demand, but we should not overstock drastically to avoid holding costs on unsold inventory in the final moments.
    *   **Immediate Risk:** On-hand is only 26. P48 demand is ~110. We will likely stock out in P48 unless the P45 order (80u) arrives *during* P48. Even then, 26+80=106, which is barely enough. We rely on the pipeline arriving.

5.  **Final Decision:**
    *   We need roughly 44-50 units to close the gap for the rest of the game.
    *   Placing an order of 50 units balances the need to cover P50 demand against the risk of leftover stock.

### **Carry-Over Insights**
Phantom inventory remains stable at 1465 units; effective pipeline verified as P45-P47 orders (260 units total). Demand has fully recovered to ~108 unit average (last 3 periods) following the suppression event. Lead times remain 2-3 periods.

{
  "rationale": "Demand has rebounded to ~108 avg. Current effective inventory (On-hand 26 + Valid Pipeline 260 = 286) covers demand through part of Period 50 (Total need ~330). With 3 periods left, ordering 50 units covers the remaining gap without significant overstock risk, assuming LT=2 delivery for Period 50 consumption.",

Period 49 (Period_49) VM Action:

{
  "rationale": "Current on-hand is 0 following a stockout in Period 48. Analyzing supply chain reliability: The order from Period 45 (80 units) has not arrived after 3 full periods (Period 48 conclude showed 0 arrivals). Since recent successful lead times were max 3 periods (e.g., P40, P41, P42), P45 is now overdue and likely lost, consistent with the pattern of phantom inventory accumulation. I am updating my calculation of Phantom Inventory to 1545 units (previous 1465 + lost P45 order). The valid pipeline is therefore only 230 units (P46: 150, P47: 30, P48: 50). Demand is averaging ~97 units recently with spikes up to 127. The valid pipeline is insufficient for the next 3 periods (P49-P51), and specifically, the small orders in P47/P48 (30 and 50 units) create a high risk of stockouts in Period 50 and 51 even if they arrive on time. To stabilize coverage for Period 52+ and re-establish safety stock, I must place a larger order now. Target pipeline coverage ~400 units (4 periods demand). Gap is 400 - 230 = 170. I will order 180 to be slightly aggressive given the recent stockouts.",

{
  "rationale": "Demand has rebounded to a high-volume regime (avg ~108 in P45-P49) after the suppression period. We are facing a severe supply chain blackout with no arrivals in the last 4 periods. Crucially, the P46 order (150 units) failed to arrive by the Period 49 conclude message (Lead Time > 3 periods); historically, orders exceeding LT=3 are lost. I am therefore treating P46 as lost, leaving a dangerously thin valid pipeline of just 260 units (P47+P48+P49). With 0 on-hand inventory and small incoming orders (P47:30, P48:50) inadequate to cover the ~110/period demand, immediate stockouts are guaranteed for P50-P51.
