Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Initializing with provided historical demand data (5 samples). Observed statistics: Mean ~102, StdDev ~28. Starting with zero inventory implies stockouts for P1 and P2 given the 2-period lead time. Using default parameters (utilizing all available historical samples) to establish a robust base stock for when the first shipment arrives in Period 3. No lead time deviation observed yet, so using promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2: We are in the early phase of the simulation with limited history. In Period 1, we ordered 149 units, but received 0 (which is expected as promised L=2). Demand in Period 1 was 91, but we had 0 stock so 0 sales. The historical data block provided in the system prompt gives a 5-period 'pre-game' sample history: [141, 118, 67, 94, 89]. The mean of these 5 samples is 101.8. However, the observed demand in Period 1 was significantly different from some of these (91 is close to the average of the last 3 samples: (67+94+89)/3 \u2248 83.3). Given the potential decreasing trend in the sample data (141->118->67) followed by stabilization (94->89->91), I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to capture the overall volatility while weighing recent stability. Lead time is still unproven (no arrivals yet), so I stick to the promised lead time (default).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 3. Observed demand for P1 and P2 was 91 and 130 respectively (avg 110.5), showing significant volatility and an upward trend compared to the earlier samples. Stockouts occurred in both periods (0 sold). No arrivals have been observed yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (P1 order arrives in P3, visible in P4). We have 271 units in transit. Given the stockout situation and demand volatility, we use recent_N based on the limited observed history to set a responsive base stock level.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4. The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) was promised to arrive in Period 3 (Lead Time=2) but is confirmed as 'arrived=0' in the Period 3 conclude message. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. The total pipeline is 344 units (orders from P1, P2, P3), implying nothing has arrived yet. If we stick to the default L=2, the base stock calculation (covering L+1=3 periods) will likely be lower than the current delayed pipeline, resulting in 0 orders and continued stockouts. To correct this, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to reflect the reality of slower shipments and force the system to hold a larger pipeline (Base Stock covering 4 periods). Demand is averaged over the observed history (N=3).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed > 2 periods: Period 1 order failed to arrive by Period 3 conclude.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 5. The history now provides crucial data regarding lead times and demand. 

1. **Lead Time Analysis**: 
   - Period 1 order (149 units) arrived in Period 4 conclude (lead time = 4-1 = 3 periods).
   - Period 3 order (73 units) arrived in Period 4 conclude (lead time = 4-3 = 1 period).
   - Wait, looking closely at Period 4 conclude: 'arrived... 149 units (ordered Period 1...), 73 units (ordered Period 3...)'. Where is the Period 2 order (122 units)? It has NOT arrived yet. Period 2 + Promised(2) = Period 4 arrival. It failed to arrive in Period 4. It might arrive in Period 5 or is lost. This suggests instability. 
   - Average observed L so far: (3 + 1) / 2 = 2.0. However, the missing Period 2 order is concerning. 
   - Given the variability (1 period vs 3 periods) and the missing order, sticking to 'default' (promised=2) or 'calculate' (avg=2) seems risky but defensible as an average. The carry-over insight noted L>2, which was confirmed by the Period 1 order taking 3 periods. I will use 'calculate' to act on the actual realized data so far (avg 2.0), but keep a close eye on the variance.

2. **Demand Analysis**: 
   - History: 141 (P1-extrapolated from order?), wait, let's look at the provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section vs 'GAME HISTORY' logs.
   - Provided Samples in prompt: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89.
   - Game History logs show demand: 
     - P1: 91
     - P2: 130
     - P3: 114
     - P4: 118
   - Note: The 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' list provides specific values (Period_1: 141, etc.) which might differ from the specific game instance logs or are intended as 'historical samples' prior to the game. However, I must rely on the Game History logs for the *current* realization. 
   - Current Game Demands: 91, 130, 114, 118. Average = 113.25. 
   - The prompt likely provided generic samples (141, 118...) but the actual game execution values are in the logs (91, 130...). I will focus on the actual observed game logs for `recent_N`. Let's use N=4 (all observed history).

3. **Decision**:
   - **L**: 'calculate' (Observed avg is 2.0). 
   - **mu_hat**: 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current game's specific level (approx 113).
   - **sigma_hat**: 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 4: Lead time instability confirmed (P1->P4=3 periods, P3->P4=1 period); Period 2 order still missing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6. Based on history, demand has been fairly volatile (samples: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89; observed demand in game log: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106). The average demand over the last 5 periods (91, 130, 114, 118, 106) is approximately 112 units. The variance is noticeable. 

Lead time is highly unstable. 
- Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (Lead time = 3).
- Period 2 order (122 units) is STILL MISSING. It was ordered in Period 2. We are starting Period 6 (which means Period 5 concluded). If it had a normal lead time of 2, it would arrive in P4. If it was 3 periods, it would arrive in P5. It did NOT arrive in P5 conclude. It is now 4 periods late (lead time > 3). This effectively acts like a lost order or extremely delayed shipment.
- Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (Lead time = 1).
- Since the lead times are erratic (1, 3, and >3), reliance on the default promised lead time of 2 is risky. Given the missing order from Period 2 and the mix of fast (1) and slow (3) lead times, I will set an explicit lead time estimate of 3 to be safer/conservative, ensuring we hold enough stock to cover these delays.

For demand (mu_hat), recent samples (Periods 1-5 demand: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106) show a mean of ~112. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this level.
For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the variation seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 2 order (122 units) confirmed significantly delayed/lost (ordered P2, not arrived by end of P5, implies LT >= 4). Lead time remains highly volatile.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand dropped unexpectedly to 46, significantly below the prior average (~117). The P2 order (122 units) has still not arrived (elapsed 4 periods vs promised 2), and P4 (elapsed 2 periods) is also outstanding. The 'In-transit' count of 472 is likely inflated by the P2 'ghost' inventory. To compensate for this un-usable pipeline inventory and the observed volatility (lead times ranging 1-4+), I am explicitly setting L=4. This artificially raises the Base Stock target (approx +200 units) to override the 122 stuck units and correct the order quantity. I use recent_N=5 for demand/sigma to smooth the P6 dip while remaining responsive.

Carry-over insight: Period 6 demand significant drop to 46 (prev avg ~117). P2 order (122 units) confirmed missing > 4 periods (likely lost/ghost inventory).

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: We face a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge. The Period 2 order (122 units) is now 6 periods old and considered lost, but remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (440 units), erroneously inflating the inventory position to 490. Real availability is only ~368 units (440 - 122 lost + 50 on-hand). To force the OR backend to replenish despite this phantom surplus, we must artificially inflate the target base stock. We do this by increasing 'mu_hat' to 125 (Estimated Real Demand ~95 + Compensation ~30). Compensation is calculated as Lost_Order (122) / (L+1) \u2248 30. We set L=3 ('explicit') reflecting the consistent 3-period lead time observed for P1 and P4. Sigma is kept at default to maintain safety stock against demand volatility (P6 low of 46 vs P7 recovery to 86).

Carry-over insight: P2 order (122 units) confirmed lost (6 periods pending). Demand recovering (P7=86) after P6 dip. Lead time consistently 3 periods (P1, P4 orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: Demand has recovered (103 units in P8) after P6 dip. The P2 order (122 units) is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost, creating 'ghost inventory' that inflates the system's pipeline view (217 units vs 95 real). Real on-hand is 170. To compensate for the 122 phantom units and cover actual lead time risk (often 3 periods), I am inflating mu_hat significantly. Target calculation: 4 periods demand (~440) + Ghost Inventory (122) = ~562 target. Setting mu_hat=565 achieves this base stock. I keep L at default (2) to prevent the policy cap from restricting this necessary recovery order.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (122 units) confirmed lost (>6 periods delay). Lead time unstable (1-3 periods). Ghost inventory of 122 units necessitates inflated demand parameters to force replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: On-hand 72 is critical (below expected demand ~100). Period 6 order (95 units) is now >3 periods overdue (ordered P6, not arrived by P9 close), suggesting it is lost alongside the Period 2 order (122 units). Total ghost inventory held in 'In-transit' is likely 217 units (122+95). To correct this, I must artificially inflate the base stock target. 

Calculations: Estimated true demand ~96 (based on recent post-dip avg). Safety L=3 (given frequent L=3 and L>3 observations). Target Base Stock = Demand * (L+1) = 96 * 4 = 384. Add Ghost Inventory Offset (+217) = 601. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 610 to trigger a replinishment order that compensates for the phantom pipeline. Sigma set to 40 to account for L volatility (1 vs 3+).

Carry-over insight: Period 6 order (95 units) confirmed overdue > 3 periods; likely lost/ghost inventory now includes P6 (Total Ghost ~217 including P2). Demand stabilized ~96/period after P6 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. On-hand is 0. Recent demand spiked to 137 in Period 10, with an average around 115. Critical issue: The 122-unit order from P2 AND the 95-unit order from P6 are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). P6 order was skipped in arrival sequence (P5 and P7 arrived in P8) and hasn't arrived by P10 conclude efficiently confirming loss. Total ghost inventory = 122 + 95 = 217. Reported pipeline is 572, but effective pipeline is only 355. We must inflate 'mu_hat' by 217 to force the backend to re-order the missing units. We set L=3 (explicit) to reflect the volatile longest lead times (LT=3 observed for P1, P4, P5). Base demand for horizon (L+1=4) approx 115*4 = 460. Total target mu = 460 + 217 = 677.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (95 units) confirmed lost (>4 periods overdue, skipped in arrival queue). Total ghost inventory confirmed at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Demand spike P10 (137) signals high volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Current demand averages ~102 units/period (last 5 periods). We face significant 'ghost inventory' of 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 confirmed lost/overdue). However, recent aggressive ordering (P9, P10, P11) has created a heavy 'real' pipeline of 504 units. This real supply is sufficient to cover approx. 5 periods of demand, meaning the system-calculated 'Order 0' is actually the correct operational decision for now, despite the ghost inventory distortion. I am setting L=explicit(2.5) to account for observed volatility (1 vs 3 periods) and using recent_N=5 for demand to stabilize the forecast. No artificial inflation is needed yet as the heavy pipeline must bleed off first.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Real pipeline is 504 units (P9+P10+P11), providing ~5 periods of cover. Pipeline is currently overstocked; parameter inflation to offset ghost inventory will only be necessary once real pipeline drops below ~300 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (Date: Period_13). System shows On-hand 268 + In-transit 366 = 634 IP. However, In-transit contains 217 units of confirmed ghost inventory (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Real In-transit is 149 (P11 order). Real Inventory Position (IP) is 268 + 149 = 417. Recent demand (last 5 avg ~102) and recent lead times (avg ~2.4) suggest a target base stock of ~350-400 units. Since Real IP (417) > Target, we are currently sufficiently stocked and expect a zero order. We maintain 'recent_N' parameters to track accurate demand and lead time (L avg ~2.4) without artificial inflation, as the ghost inventory does not yet threaten service levels.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Real pipeline is 149 units (P11) + 268 on-hand = 417 Real IP. Current tracking shows Real IP (417) > Demand Cover (~350), so no order is necessary. Parameter inflation strategy to offset ghost inventory is deferred until Real IP drops below ~325 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Real IP is 299 (150 OH + 149 in-transit P11), covering <2.9 periods of demand (avg ~105), which creates a stockout risk by Period 16 given the 2-3 period lead time. The System View (IP=516) is inflated by 217 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost orders from P2 & P6), preventing necessary replenishment. I am triggering the offset strategy: explicitly inflating mu_hat to 625 (representing 4 periods of demand + 217 ghost units) to overcome the frozen System IP and force an order of ~150 units to restore coverage to ~4.2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Real IP (299 units) now critical (<3 periods coverage) due to sustained ghost inventory. Triggering active parameter inflation to neutralize 217 units of ghost inventory (P2+P6) and force replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 Analysis: The 'ghost inventory' problem persists and requires active mitigation. The system believes 'In-transit' is 369 units. Reconciling history reveals actual pending pipeline is only 152 units (ordered P14). The remaining 217 units (369 observed - 152 actual) are the lost orders from P2 (122) and P6 (95). With On-hand of 188, my Real Inventory Position (Real IP) is 188 + 152 = 340 units. Average demand (last 5 periods) is approx 108 units. To cover L+1 periods (where L is effectively 3 given recent data), I need roughly 4 * 108 = 432 units. My Real IP (340) is currently below this target (shortfall ~92 units). However, the OR engine sees IP = 188 + 369 = 557, which is far above target, so it will not order. To force an order of ~92 units, I must inflate the target base stock to approx 557 + 92 = 649. With L=3 (explicit), target = (1+L)*mu + safety. To hit ~649 target with L=3, I need mu_hat to be ~130 and a high sigma, or just set explicit mu_hat very high. Calculating explicitly: Target = 649. Denom = 4. mu_hat_param = 649 / 4 = 162.25. I will set L=3 (consistent actuals) and mu_hat='explicit' value=162.25 to trick the engine into ordering despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Real pipeline is only 152 units (P14). Real IP (340) is now below target coverage, necessitating aggressive parameter inflation to counteract ghost stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Real Inventory Position (IP) is 263 units (111 On-hand + 152 In-transit from P14), while the System IP is falsely 480 due to 217 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2 and P6). With an observed lead time of 3 periods and mean demand ~96, the Real IP covers less than 3 periods (P16, P17, part of P18). A stockout in P18 is likely unless the P14 order arrives early (L=2). To ensure service continuity for P19 onwards, we must trigger an immediate replenishment order. I am inflating 'mu_hat' to 715 to explicitly cancel out the 217 ghost units and target a robust base stock that includes safety buffer (Target ~500 + 217 Ghost = 717).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains confirmed at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Real IP (263) is critical (<3 periods coverage). Potential cyclic demand dip observed (P6: 46 -> P15: 77, ~9 period interval). Parameter inflation strategy actively maintained to offset ghost stock until real inventory recovers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: Critical stockout (On-hand: 0) following a massive demand spike in Period 16 (273 units vs avg ~115). Ghost inventory of 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95) persists, artificially inflating the System Inventory Position to 581, while the Real Inventory Position is only 364 (P14+P16 orders). Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. To force the system to order despite the ghost inventory and low real coverage (<3 periods), parameter inflation is required. We set an explicit mu_hat target calculated as: (Avg Demand ~135 * 4 periods coverage) + 217 Ghost Offset = ~757. We round up to 780 to buffer against the recent volatility observed in P16.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P16 (273 units, >2x avg) signals extreme volatility/potential seasonality. Ghost inventory confirmed sustained at 217 units (P2+P6). Real pipeline (364 units) is fragile given the new demand peak. Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $486.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand (170) and Period 16 (273) confirm a high-volatility, high-demand regime relative to the historic average. We maintain 'explicit' L=3 to cover the observed worst-case lead time (verified again in Period 17 with mixed L=1 and L=3 arrivals). Crucially, 217 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2 & P6) remain in the system's pipeline count, artificially inflating the Inventory Position (IP) and suppressing replenishment. To counteract this, we explicitly inflate mu_hat to ~240. This forces the Base Stock target to ~1220 (System IP 679 + gap), resulting in a real order of ~540 units. This order is necessary because Real IP (462) covers less than 3 periods of the new high demand (avg ~170), risking stockouts if recent volatile lead times persist.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95); persistent since P2/P6. Recent arrivals (P14, P16) confirmed mixed lead times of 1 and 3 periods, validating the need for conservative L=3 planning. Demand has shifted to a high-volatility regime (P16: 273, P17: 170), necessitating higher safety stock coverage.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Critical stockout situation. Demand has shifted to a new high-volume regime (Avg ~225 last 3 periods vs historical <100). Ghost inventory of 217 units persists, masking the true pipeline deficit. System sees 485 in-transit, but 217 are lost, leaving only 268 real units against a demand of ~225/period. We are dangerously understocked. Using explicit L=2.5 to buffer lead time volatility. Setting aggressive explicit mu_hat=1000 (implied ~285/period over L+1) to neutralize ghost inventory and force a large replenishment order to cover the demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P16-P18 avg ~225 (vs historic ~100). Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 217 units (485 system - 268 real pending).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
System inventory pipeline (857) includes 217 units of ghost inventory (P2+P6) that will never arrive. Real pipeline is 640 units (P17: 268 + P19: 372). Current demand regime (P16-P19) averages ~198 units/period with high volatility. We need to cover L+1 (4) periods, requiring ~792 units of real stock plus safety buffer. Since real IP (640) < Target (792+SS), we must order. However, the system sees IP (857) > Target (792+SS) and will order 0. To force the correct order, we inflate mu_hat by the ghost amount: (4 * 198) + 217 \u2248 1010. L is set to 3 as P17 order (3 periods ago) is not yet visible.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme (P16-P18 avg ~225 vs P19 drop to 116). Ghost inventory persistent at 217 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21. Real In-Transaction inventory is 910 units (System 1127 - 217 Ghost). With recent average demand ~191 units (N=5), the real pipeline covers >4 periods, exceeding the target. P17 order (268 units) is overdue (not arrived by Period 20 conclude), suggesting LT >= 4 or delay. Despite 0 on-hand, the pipeline is heavy; no new order is required. We maintain conservative parameters to reflect the high demand regime (~190 vs historic ~100) and 3-period lead time, but the high pipeline (system sees 1127) will correctly suppress ordering.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 217 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95). Real pipeline is 910 units, providing substantial cover (~4.7 periods). P17 order (268 units) confirmed delayed >3 periods (ordered P17, not in P20 conclude). Demand volatility continues (P16-P20 avg ~191).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory (217 units) plus likely lost P17 order (268 units) creates a 485-unit blockage in the system pipeline. To force replenishment despite this phantom stock, mu_hat is inflated to ~1245 (Real demand coverage ~760 + Ghost offset 485). L is held at 3 to reflect realistic replenishment times.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: P17 order (268 units) confirmed overdue >5 periods (ordered P17, not arrived by start of P22). Likely joining ghost inventory. Total probable ghost stock = 485 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268). Demand stabilization ~190 avg (P16-P21). Aggressive inflation required to bypass massive ghost pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 start. Context: Critical stockouts continue (0 on-hand for 5 periods). Current System IP (1329) is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Confirmation: P17 order (268u, ordered P17, >6 periods ago) is confirmed lost/ghost. P19 order (372u, ordered P19) failed to arrive by P22 (L=3 window), suggesting it is also delayed or lost. Confirmed Ghost Stock = 485 (P2+P6+P17). Potential Ghost = 857 (adding P19). Real Pipeline is likely only P20+P22 (472 units), which covers < 2.5 periods of demand (avg ~190). To force replenishment despite the inflated System IP, I must calculate Target Base Stock = System IP (1329) + Deficit (~290). Setting mu_hat explicit ~1620 forces this order while respecting the cap.

Carry-over insight: P19 order (372 units) missed L=3 arrival window (ordered P19, not in P22 arrival), flagging as potential ghost. P17 order (268 units) confirmed lost (>6 periods delay). Ghost inventory (P2+P6+P17) now 485 units. Real pipeline estimated at ~472 units, critically low vs high demand regime (~190/period).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 conclude confirms P19 order (372 units) is lost/skipped: orders from P20 (L=3) and P22 (L=1) arrived, but P19 (ordered earlier) did not. Total ghost inventory is now 857 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372). Real pipeline is only 334 units (P23 order), plus 285 on-hand = 619 Real IP. With demand averaging ~190/period (P20-P23), current Real IP provides ~3.2 periods of coverage. To maintain safety against volatility and L=3 risks, we target ~4.5 periods coverage (~850 units). To trigger the necessary replenishment despite 857 ghost units inflating System IP (1476 total), we calculate required Base Stock = Target (850) + Ghosts (857) \u2248 1707. We set mu_hat explicitly to 1650 to achieve this base stock, anticipating a corrective order of ~200-300 units.

Carry-over insight: P19 order (372 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P20/P22 arrivals). Total ghost inventory scaled to 857 units (P2+P6+P17+P19). Real pipeline is 334 units (P23); Real IP (619) requires boost to match ~190 avg demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: Validated loss of Period 19 order (372 units) as it was skipped by P23 arrivals (P20, P22). Total ghost inventory is now confirmed at 857 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372). System in-transit (1416) minus Ghost (857) equals Real Pipeline (559 units), which matches P23+P24 orders perfectly. Real Inventory Position (On-hand 82 + Real Pipe 559) = 641 units. Demand remains high (~190 avg last 5 periods). With L=3 (conservative), target coverage is ~760 units + safety. To trigger replenishment despite 857 ghost units clogging the system view, I am setting mu_hat expressly to (Real Demand for 4 periods ~760) + (Ghost ~857) \u2248 1617. Rounding to 1650 to ensure adequate stock recovery.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 857 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372). Real pipeline is 559 units (P23: 334 + P24: 225). Demand stable high ~190. Active parameter inflation required to offset ghost stock.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory is confirmed at 857 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372). Real pipeline consists of orders from P24 (225) and P25 (195), totaling 420 units. Combined with on-hand (236), Real Inventory Position (IP) is 656 units. With average demand ~190 (recent 10-period avg), this covers ~3.5 periods (P26, P27, P28). To prevent stockout in P29 given the 2-period lead time, a replenishment order must be placed now (P26). However, System IP is 1513 (Real 656 + Ghost 857), which suppresses ordering. I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 1750 to effectively set the Base Stock Target above the System IP (1750 > 1513), forcing an order of roughly 240 units to sustain the real pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 857 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372). Real pipeline is 420 units (P24+P25). Real IP is 656 units, covering ~3.5 periods. Active parameter inflation is required to bypass ghost inventory and trigger replenishment for P29+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $699.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Current state: On-hand=49, In-transit=1575. Demand remains high (avg ~191 recently). 

Ghost Inventory Audit:
- P2 (122), P6 (95), P17 (268), P19 (372) are confirmed lost/ghost. Total confirmed ghost = 857 units.
- New candidate for ghost: P21 order (0 units, irrelevant) or P20/P22 both arrived. P23 arrived P25 (L=2). P24 is still pending (ordered P24, now P27, 3 periods elapsed, likely arrives P27 conclude).

Real Pipeline Calculation:
- Total In-transit (System): 1575
- Confirmed Ghost: 857 (P2+P6+P17+P19)
- Real Pipeline: 1575 - 857 = 718 units.
- Breakdown of Real Pipeline: P24 (225) + P25 (195) + P26 (298) = 718. Matches exactly.

Inventory Position & Coverage:
- Real IP = On-hand (49) + Real Pipeline (718) = 767 units.
- Recent demand avg ~191 (P16-P26).
- Target coverage (L+1=4 periods) = 4 * 191 = 764 units.
- Current Real IP (767) is exactly at target coverage (764). No new order is needed right now.

Strategy:
- Maintain inflation to offset the 857 ghost units so the system sees the 'real' inventory situation properly, but since we are fully stocked, the system will naturally order 0 or close to 0 even with inflation. I will keep the inflation active to ensure we don't fall behind if demand spikes again.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 857 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372). Real pipeline is 718 units (P24+P25+P26). Real IP is 767 units, matching target coverage (~4 periods). Demand remains high ~190/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current State: Stockout (0 on-hand). System In-transit is 1575 units. Analysis of arrivals confirms P24 order (225 units) is overdue >3 periods (ordered P24, failed to arrive by P27 conclude, while P23 order arrived in P25). P24 is reclassified as lost/ghost inventory. Total Ghost Inventory is now 1082 units (P2: 122 + P6: 95 + P17: 268 + P19: 372 + P24: 225). Real Pipeline is 493 units (P25: 195 + P26: 298). Real IP is 493 units. Coverage Analysis: With demand averaging ~180-190, 493 units provides ~2.7 periods of coverage, which is risky given the high volatility and L=2~3. To trigger replenishment, we must offset the 1082 units of ghost inventory. Target Base Stock = (Real Demand ~190 * 4) + Ghost(1082) \u2248 1842. Rounding mu_hat to 1900 to ensure an order of ~325 units is generated (1900 - 1575 = 325), bringing Real IP to ~818 (safe).

Carry-over insight: P24 order (225 units) confirmed lost (>3 periods overdue, skipped by earlier P23 arrival). Total ghost inventory increased to 1082 units (P2+P6+P17+P19+P24). Real pipeline is 493 units (P25+P26). Real IP (493) provides <3 periods coverage; continued aggressive parameter inflation is required to neutralize ghost stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory diagnosis: Period 25 order (195 units) is confirmed lost/ghost. Evidence: It is 4 periods old, but the Period 26 order (placed later) has already arrived (seen in Period 28 conclude). This 'skipping' behavior confirms P25 is lost. 

Inventory Reconciliation:
- System In-transit: 1677
- Known Real In-transit: 400 (Period 28 order)
- Calculated Ghost Inventory: 1677 - 400 = 1277 units (Matches sum of suspected lost orders P2+P6+P17+P19+P24+P25).
- Real On-hand: 151
- Real Inventory Position (IP): 151 + 400 = 551.

Targeting:
- Demand has softened slightly (last 3 avg ~152), but volatility remains high. Targeting ~4 periods of coverage (L=3 assumption + 1 review based on ~175 conservative demand) suggests a target Real IP of ~700 units.
- Deficit: 700 - 551 = 149 units.
- System Effective IP: 1828 (151 + 1677).
- Required Base Stock to trigger 149 unit order: 1828 + 149 = 1977.
- Action: Set mu_hat explicitly to 1980 to force this replenishment despite the massive ghost stock.

Carry-over insight: P25 order (195 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P26 arrival; >3 periods overdue). Total ghost inventory scaled to 1277 units (P2+P6+P17+P19+P24+P25). Real pipeline is 400 units (P28 order). Real IP (551) covers ~3.5 periods. Demand volatility persists despite recent softening.

Daily Reward (R_t): $604.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Real Inventory Position (IP) is 553 units (0 on-hand + 400 from P28 + 153 from P29). The system sees an IP of 1830 units because of 1277 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost orders from P2, P6, P17, P19, P24, P25). Current demand is high (P29=219, avg ~180). To maintain service level, we need ~4 periods of coverage (Target Real IP ~900). The deficit is ~350 units. To trigger this order despite the inflated System IP, we must set a target Base Stock of ~2180 (1830 + 350). We use explicit mu_hat=2150 and L=3. This sets a Base Stock roughly around 2190 and a Cap around 537 (2150/4), allowing an unconstrained order of ~360 units to replenish the real pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 1277 units (P2+P6+P17+P19+P24+P25). Real pipeline is 553 units (P28+P29). Real IP (553) is ~3 periods cover; demand spike in P29 (219 units) necessitates maintaining strong buffer.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision based on sustained ghost inventory and demand volatility. 

1. Ghost Inventory Analysis:
   - Confirmed ghosts: P2(122) + P6(95) + P17(268) + P19(372) + P24(225) + P25(195) + P29(153).
   - P29 order (153 units) is now highly suspect. The system says P28 arrived (L=2), but P29 is still outstanding. Given the pattern of skipped orders (P24, P25 were skipped by P26), P29 is likely lost or effectively ghosted as well. 
   - Total Ghost Inventory Estimate: 1277 (previous) + 153 (P29) = 1430 units.
   - System In-Transit: 1793 units.
   - Real Pipeline Estimate: 1793 - 1430 = 363 units (matches P30 order).

2. Inventory Position:
   - On-hand: 195
   - Real Pipeline: 363 (P30)
   - Real Inventory Position: 195 + 363 = 558 units.

3. Demand Analysis:
   - Current regime (P23-P30) average demand is approx 181 units/period.
   - Coverage check: 558 units / 181 \u2248 3 periods of coverage.
   - Target coverage is typically Lead Time (3) + 1 = 4 periods to be safe. We are slightly under-covered.

4. Parameter Strategy:
   - The system sees 195 (OH) + 1793 (IT) = 1988 units total.
   - To force an order, we need Base Stock > 1988.
   - Target Base Stock = (Ghost 1430) + (Target Real IP ~4 * 185 = 740) \u2248 2170 units.
   - We set 'explicit' mu_hat to a high value to generate this target base stock. 
   - Base Stock \u2248 mu + z*sigma. Just setting a high mu is sufficient.
   - Target mu \u2248 2200.
   - We keep sigma explicit to suppress variance noise and rely on the high mean to drive the safety stock up.
   - Lead time L=3 is maintained as the conservative estimate based on history (P28 arrived in 2, but P20 took 3, and skipping happens).

Carry-over insight: P29 order (153 units) marked as lost/ghost (skipped by P30 arrival). Total ghost inventory updated to 1430 units. Real pipeline is 363 units (P30). Real IP (558) covers ~3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $780.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. System shows 2048 units in-transit, but 1277 of these are confirmed ghost inventory (Orders P2, P6, P17, P19, P24, P25). The previous period's insight incorrectly flagged P29 (153 units) as 'skipped' by the P30 arrival; however, the P30 arrival was from P28 (an older order), so sequence was preserved. P29 is currently 2 periods old (ordered P29, L=2 expected, P32 is 3rd period); it is delayed relative to recent L=2 performance but not confirmed lost. 'Real' IP is thus 771 units (P29+P30+P31). Demand is high (~220 avg). To maintain ~4 periods of coverage (Target ~880), we need to order ~110-200 units (hedging P29 delay). Current System IP (2048) falsely signals massive overstock. Inflating mu_hat to 2250 forces a base stock > 2048, triggering an order of approx 200 units (2250 - 2048).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory sum revised to 1277 units (P2:122 + P6:95 + P17:268 + P19:372 + P24:225 + P25:195). P29 (153 units) is delayed but not yet confirmed lost. Real pipeline 771 units. Demand remains strong (>200 avg).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
P29 order (153 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P31 arrival). Ghost inventory updated to 1430 units. System reports 2004 in-transit, but real pipeline is at best 574 units (and P30 is at high risk of being lost too). Real Inventory Position (652) is low for current demand (~200/period). Setting mu_hat=2500 (approx System IP 2082 + buffer) to force a replenishment order of ~400 units despite ghost stock.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1430 units (P2+P6+P17+P19+P24+P25+P29). P30 order (363 units) is highly suspect (skipped by P31 arrival) but not yet confirmed lost. Real pipeline is fragile (574 units max, potentially lower). Demand remains high (avg ~200).

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
P30 order (363 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P32 order in P33 arrival). Total ghost inventory reaches 1793 units (System 2220 - Real 427). Real IP is 556 units (129 on-hand + 427 P33 real order), which is ~212 units below the target of ~768 (4 periods of demand). The system sees 2349 total units and will order 0. We must inflate mu_hat to ~2561 to neutralize the 1793 ghost units and trigger a replenishing order of ~212 units.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1793 units (P2:122+P6:95+P17:268+P19:372+P24:225+P25:195+P29:153+P30:363). Real pipeline is only 427 units (P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: Ghost inventory increases to 1793 units as Period 30 order (363 units) is confirmed lost (skipped by P31/P32 arrivals, now >4 periods old). Current System IP (2522) - Ghost (1793) = Real IP (729). With demand averaging ~200/period (recent peaks ~220), Real IP provides ~3.6 periods of coverage. On-hand is 0, making the pipeline critical. To maintain ~5 periods of real coverage (safe buffer against ~50% loss rate), we target a Real IP of ~1000. Required target Base Stock = System IP (2522) + Order (~270) \u2248 2800. Setting mu_hat to 2600 (explicit) plus safety stock achieves this target.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1793 units (P2:122+P6:95+P17:268+P19:372+P24:225+P25:195+P29:153+P30:363). Real pipeline is 729 units (P33+P34). Demand remains high (~200 avg). High order loss rate persists.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: Ongoing stockout (On-hand 0). Ghost inventory confirmed at 1793 units (P2+P6+P17+P19+P24+P25+P29+P30). System 'In-transit' shows 2691, implying Real Pipeline is 2691 - 1793 = 898 units (P33: 427 + P34: 302 + P35: 169). P33 order (427 units) is overdue relative to promised L=2 but fits historical L=3; if it does not arrive next period, Real IP drops critically. Current Real IP (898) covers ~4.5 periods of high demand (~200/period), but stockout requires immediate inflow. To trigger replenishment despite the massive ghost inventory inflating System IP, extreme parameter inflation is applied. Target Base Stock set to ~2900 (System IP 2691 + ~200 order) using mu_hat=725 and L=3.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 1793 units (P2:122+P6:95+P17:268+P19:372+P24:225+P25:195+P29:153+P30:363). P33 order (427 units) overdue vs promised L=2, monitoring for loss. Real pipeline is 898 units (P33+P34+P35). Demand remains high (~200 avg).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 Analysis: Critical inventory shortage detected. The P33 order (427 units, ordered Period 33) is confirmed lost, as the P34 order (302 units) arrived in Period 36 conclude, skipping the P33 order entirely. Total confirmed ghost inventory is now 2220 units (previous 1793 + 427 from P33). While the System In-Transit shows 2389 units, the Real Pipeline is only 169 units (the pending P35 order). Current Real Inventory Position (On-Hand 90 + Real Pipeline 169) is 259 units, which covers barely 1 period of demand (recent avg ~215). With a likely stockout approaching in Period 38, we must trigger an immediate large replenishment. We apply aggressive parameter inflation (mu_hat=3000) to override the system's false overstock perception (caused by the 2220 ghost units) and force an order of ~520 units.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (427 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P34 arrival in Period 36). Total confirmed ghost inventory increased to 2220 units (P2+P6+P17+P19+P24+P25+P29+P30+P33). Real pipeline is critically low at 169 units (Period 35 order). Demand remains high and stable (~217 avg last 3 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
P33 order (427 units) confirmed lost; Total ghost inventory matches 2220 units. Real pipeline is 601 units (P37). Real IP is 678. To neutralize ghost stock (2220) and maintain coverage target (~800), we need a virtual Base Stock of ~3020. With L=2 (Cover=3), target mu_hat = 3020/3 \u2248 1006.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 2220 units (P2...P33). Real pipeline is 601 units (P37). Real IP (678) covers ~3.2 periods of demand (avg ~210). High demand regime persists.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory remains confirmed at 2220 units (Orders P2 through P33). Real pipeline consists of the Period 37 order (601 units) which is expected to arrive during Period 39 (L=2 observed recently). Real Inventory Position is 601 units, covering ~2.9 periods of demand (current avg ~210). To prevent stockouts in Period 41, we must trigger an order now. The system sees 2821 units (601 real + 2220 ghost); we set mu_hat explicitly to ~3100 to force an order of ~280-300 units, maintaining continuity of supply.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 2220 units (P2:122 + P6:95 + P17:268 + P19:372 + P24:225 + P25:195 + P29:153 + P30:363 + P33:427). Real pipeline is 601 units (P37) which arrives P39. Real IP is 601. Demand stable high ~210. Recent arrivals (P34, P35) confirm L=2 stability.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Period 39 conclude). Stockout continues (On-hand 0). Demand remains strong (~210-228 units/period). 

CRITICAL OBSERVATION: Period 37 order (601 units) failed to arrive by Period 39 conclude (Promised L=2). Given recent history of L=2 stability (P34, P35 arrived on time), this non-arrival is alarming and suggests the order is either delayed or lost. 

INVENTORY STATE: 
- System In-Transit: 3180
- Confirmed Ghost (P2..P33): 2220
- Suspected Ghost/Delayed (P37): 601
- Real Reliable Pipeline (P39): 359 units

SCENARIO ANALYSIS:
If P37 is lost, real pipeline is only 359 units, covering <2 periods of demand (Safety Risk: EXTREME). 
To mitigate stockout risk, we must trigger replenishment assuming P37 might not arrive. 
Target Real Coverage = 4 periods * 220 = 880 units. 
Target System Level = System IT (3180) - Real Current (359) + Target Real (880) = ~3700.

Setting mu_hat to 3700 forces an order of ~520 units alongside the potential 601 units, providing a safety net against the 'lost order' scenario. We use explicit L=2 to effectively scale the cap logic.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 2220 units (P2 through P33). Period 37 order (601 units) failed to arrive in Period 39 (L=2 window), flagged as 'suspect/delayed' (Total susceptible ghost pool -> 2821 units). Real reliable pipeline is critically low at 359 units (P39). High demand regime (~220 avg) persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 analysis: The Period 37 order (601 units, promised L=2) failed to arrive by Period 40 conclude, while the later Period 39 order (359 units) arrived successfully (L=1). This confirms P37 as lost/ghost inventory. Total ghost inventory is now calculated at 2821 units (calculated from System In-Transit 3422 - Real Pending P40 order 601). Real On-Hand is 164 units, and Real Pipeline is 601 units, yielding a Real Inventory Position (IP) of 765 units. With average demand stable around ~207 units/period, Real IP covers ~3.7 periods. To hedge against the high loss rate (especially of large orders like P37 and the pending P40) and bypass the massive ghost inventory signal, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly to 3800. This targets a System Base Stock slightly above current System IP (3586), triggering a moderate replenishment order (~214 units) to keep the pipeline active without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Period 37 order (601 units) confirmed lost (skipped by P39 arrival); Total ghost inventory increased to 2821 units (System 3422 - Real Pending 601). Real pipeline is 601 units (P40). Demand remains stable ~207 avg (P35-P40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory confirmed at 2821 units, perfectly reconciling with system in-transit (3716) - real pipeline (895: P40+P41). Period 41 demand spiked to 260 units (highest since Period 16), raising the volatility significantly. While Real IP (895) covers ~4 periods of average demand (~215), the 50% order loss rate and recent demand spike necessitate a higher buffer. Inflating mu_hat to neutralized ghost inventory and target ~5.3 periods of real coverage (ordering ~250 units).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 2821 units (P2...P37). Real pipeline is 895 units (P40+P41). Demand spike in Period 41 (260 units) increases volatility risk; ordering buffer strategy maintained.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 43. Demand is high and volatile (avg ~210, peak 260). We have 0 on-hand. System In-transit is 3979. Confirmed Ghost Inventory is 2821 (up to P37). Order P40 (601 units) is overdue (L>2) but considered delayed/suspect rather than confirmed lost, as L=3 is historically possible. Real Pipeline is estimated at 1158 units (P40 overdue 601 + P41 294 + P42 263). This provides ~5.5 periods of coverage, which is sufficient. Even if P40 is lost, coverage is ~2.6 periods. Given the high system inventory preventing orders without massive inflation, and sufficient real pipeline coverage, we hold parameters steady (no inflation) to avoid overstocking. We use L=3 to account for delivery volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 2821 units (P2...P37). Period 40 order (601 units) is overdue >2 periods (ordered P40, not arrived P42) and flagged as 'suspect' (potentially joining ghost stock). Real pipeline is 1158 units (P40+P41+P42), assuming P40 is just delayed. Demand remains in high regime (~210 avg).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 conclude confirms P40 order (601 units) arrived with L=3, proving 3-period lead times are active (vs promised 2). P37 order is confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory is exactly 2821 units, matching the difference between system in-transit (3378) and recent active orders (P41: 294 + P42: 263 = 557). Real Inventory Position is 940 (383 on-hand + 557 pipeline), covering ~4.3 periods of demand (avg ~216). However, P41 is already overdue relative to quoted L=2, carrying a risk of loss. To insure against P41 loss and maintain cover in this high-demand regime, I am continuing the parameter inflation strategy to target a replenishment order of ~240 units (Target 4000 - SysIP 3761).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 2821 units (P2 through P37). P40 arrival confirmed Lead Time = 3 is possible and valid. P41 order (294 units) is now overdue relative to promised L=2 (created P41, not arrived P43), flagged as susceptible to loss.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 45. Real On-hand is 507. Real Pipeline is 545 units (P42: 263 + P44: 282), assuming Lead Time ~3 periods based on recent P40/P41 arrivals. Total Real Inventory Position (IP) is 1052 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~207 units/period. Current Real IP provides ~5.1 periods of coverage. Target coverage (L=3 + Review=1) is 4 periods. Since Real IP > Target, no order is required. System 'In-transit' shows 3366, implying a ghost inventory of 2821 units (3366 - 545). Since we do not need to order, we will maintain standard tracking parameters without inflation.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 2821 units (P2...P37). P41 order (294 units) arrived successfully with L=3, resolving the 'suspect' flag from Period 44. Real pipeline is 545 units (P42, P44). Real IP (1052) provides robust 5-period coverage; no parameter inflation needed this period. Lead time of 3 periods confirmed by recent arrivals (P40, P41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory is 2821 units. System IP (3647) masks true IP (826 = 544 OH + 282 Pipeline). Real coverage is ~3.9 periods. To traverse L=3 lead time and cover Period 50, parameters are inflated to offset ghost stock and trigger a maintenance order. mu_hat=950 targets a base stock ~3800 > System IP.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 2821 units (P2...P37). P42 order (263 units) arrived P45 with L=3, confirming sustained Lead Time = 3 regime. Real pipeline is 282 units (P44). Real IP (826) provides ~3.9 periods coverage; proactive parameter inflation required to trigger replenishment for Period 50 coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 Analysis: Ghost inventory remains stable at 2821 units (accumulated from multiple lost orders P2-P37). P44 order (282 units) is due now or next period (Promised L=2, Observed Recent L=3). Recent arrivals in P43, P44, P45 all confirmed a consistent actual lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 3103 includes the 2821 ghost units, meaning the Real Pipeline is only 3103 - 2821 = 282 units (Period 44 order). 

Inventory position calculation:
Real On-hand: 315
Real Pipeline: 282 (P44)
Total Real Inventory Position: 315 + 282 = 597 units.
Target coverage needed: ~3 periods of demand (avg ~210/period) = ~630-650 units.

Current Real IP (597) < Target (630+), so replenishment is required. The system sees 3103 pipeline and won't order. I must aggressively inflate the base stock to 'hide' the 2821 ghost units and force an order.

Inflation Calculation:
Ghost Inventory: 2821
Target Real Base Stock: ~650 (mean 215 * 3)
Required System Base Stock setting: 2821 + 650 = 3471.
Using 'explicit' mu_hat to set this target: mu_hat \u2248 3471.

Lead time logic: Recent arrivals consistently show L=3. I will stick to explicit L=3 to match reality, though for base stock sizing the mu_hat override handles the volume.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 2821 units (P2...P37). Real pipeline is 282 units (P44). Real IP (597) is below target coverage (~3 periods). Sustained Lead Time = 3 confirmed by arrivals in P43, P44, P45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $685.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48/50. Real IP is critical (115 + P47 pipeline), but with confirmed Lead Time = 3 (observed in P43, P44, P45 arrivals), an order placed now would arrive in Period 51, after the game ends. Additionally, the P44 order (282 units) failed to arrive in P47 (L=3), suggesting it is lost or L>=4. The system sees 3251 in-transit (mostly ghost stock) and will order 0. I will allow this behavior, as forcing an order now has extremely low probability of generating sales (requires L<=2) and high risk of waste. Switching to standard parameters to let the game conclude without valid orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: P44 order (282 units) confirmed lost/delayed >3 periods (ordered P44, not in P47 conclude). With sustained L=3, new orders cannot arrive before game end (P50). Ceasing aggressive inflation strategies.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. On-hand is 0. System reports 3251 'in-transit', but 3103 of these are confirmed ghost inventory (cumulative loss P2 through P44). The only valid order in the pipeline is P47 (148 units). Recent arrivals (P43-P45) confirm a rigid Lead Time of 3 periods. With L=3, any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 52 (post-game). Even an unlikely L=1 arrival would only reach P50, by which time demand is likely missed. Given the short horizon and long lead times, no further replenishment is possible. I return to default parameters; the massive ghost inventory will correctly suppress any new orders, preventing end-of-game overstock.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 3103 units (Previous 2821 + P44: 282 lost/overdue >3 periods). Real pipeline is 148 units (P47). With sustained L=3, no new orders can arrive before game end (P50).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Game End (Period 50/50). Any order placed now will arrive after the simulation concludes (Min observed lead time = 1). Therefore, ordering is unnecessary. Setting parameters to prevent further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Simulation concluded. Final ghost inventory estimated ~3100+ units.
