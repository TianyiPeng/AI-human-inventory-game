Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Start of simulation. Historical demand (5 periods) shows a mean of ~109 and standard deviation of ~14.5, though there is a downward trend in the last 2 samples. Given the high critical ratio (Profit $4 / ($4+$1) = 0.8), maximizing service level is prioritized over minimizing holding costs. Therefore, I am using the full 5-period history (default method) to establish a robust base stock level rather than reacting solely to the recent dip. Lead time is set to the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 133 in-transit. Observed demand in Period 1 was 102, which generally aligns with the provided historical samples (avg ~109). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the total protection interval is L+1=3 periods. The current pipeline (133) is insufficient for 3 periods of demand (~324 units). I am ordering to fill the pipeline. Since game history is too short for robust statistical calculation (only 1 point), I am providing explicit forecasts derived from the combination of historical data and the single observed point.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3. We have observed two periods of demand (102, 87) which average ~94.5. This is lower than the provided historical samples (118, 124...), suggesting a lower sustained demand regime or a downward trend in this specific run. We have not yet received the Period 1 order, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (arrival expected during Period 3). We have 0 on-hand and significant lost sales. We set L to default (2). For demand parameters, we use recent_N=2 to align the forecast with the actual observed lower demand (avg ~95) rather than the higher historical samples, preventing future overstocking once the pipeline fills.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 4. Observations show a lead time deviation: an order placed in Period 1 (promised LT=2) was expected to arrive in Period 3 but 'Period 3 conclude' reports 0 arrivals. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. To maintain service levels (Critical Ratio 0.8) and prevent stockouts (On-hand is 0), I am explicitly increasing the lead time parameter L to 3. This extends the inventory coverage horizon. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the current volatility observed in the game history (Demand: 102, 87, 126).

Carry-over insight: Lead time mismatch confirmed: Period 1 order failed to arrive by Period 3 (promised LT=2), implying actual LT >= 3.

Daily Profit: $352.00, Daily Holding Cost: $79.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 5. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is [118, 124, 116, 96, 91] (observed in the prompt's history block, though note the 'Game History' section lists realized demands 102, 87, 126, 88). There is a slight discrepancy between the 'Historical Demand Data' summary in the instructions and the 'Game History' logs. I will prioritize the 'Game History' logs as they represent the actual simulation events: [102, 87, 126, 88]. The average is approx 100.75. 

Regarding lead time: The promised lead time is 2 periods. 
- Order P1 (133) arrived in P4. Delivery time = 4 - 1 = 3 periods.
- Order P2 (132) has NOT arrived yet (concluded P4 shows P1 and P3 arrivals, but not P2). Since it was ordered in P2, if LT=2 it should arrive P4. If LT=3 it should arrive P5. Its absence in P4 confirm LT >= 3 for that order too, or it might be lost. 
- Order P3 (34) arrived in P4. Delivery time = 4 - 3 = 1 period.

This variety (LT=3, LT=1) suggests high variance in lead times or unreliable delivery. The average observed so far is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised mean, but the variance is huge. 

Since the Period 2 order is still outstanding (transit 270 includes P2=132 and P4=138), we have a risk of a gap. However, on-hand is 79, which covers nearly one period of demand (avg ~100). 

Given the instability in lead times (ranging 1 to 3), I will set L=2 (explicitly or default) but pad the safety stock slightly by using recent demand volatility. The demand sequence 102, 87, 126, 88 shows fluctuations. 

Strategy:
1. **L**: Use explicit L=2 as a robust baseline given observed avg is 2 (3 and 1), though volatility exists.
2. **Mu**: Recent demand is averaging around 100. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the local mean.
3. **Sigma**: Use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen in P3 (126) vs P2 (87).

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1->P4 (LT=3), P3->P4 (LT=1). Average is 2, but variance is high.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 ended with a stockout (Final Inv: 0) and demand remains robust (avg ~104). The critical issue is the order from Period 2 (132 units), which has not arrived after 4 periods (ordered P2, current P6), far exceeding the promised lead time of 2. This suggests a lost shipment or extreme delay, meaning the 'In-transit' count of 270 is effectively inflated by 'ghost' inventory. To compensate for this risk and recover from the stockout, I am explicitly setting Lead Time to 3 to increase the base stock target. Demand parameters use the full 5-period history (N=5) to smooth volatility.

Carry-over insight: Severe delay confirmed: Period 2 order (132 units) remains undelivered after 4 periods (now Period 6), exceeding observed max Lead Time of 3.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Severe supply chain disruption detected. Period 2 order (132 units) is now 5 periods old (Promised LT=2) and has not arrived, but remains in 'in-transit' count (402), artificially inflating pipeline inventory and suppressing reorders. Period 4 order is also late (current age 3). We have been stocked out for 2 consecutive periods. To counteract the 'ghost' inventory of the lost P2 order and force a replenishment order despite the inflated pipeline, I am explicitly setting Lead Time to 4 periods. This raises the target base stock significantly (Target ~536 vs Pipeline 402), triggering a capped order to restore stock levels. Demand remains stable (~101 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order confirmed lost/stuck: 132 units outstanding for 5 periods (Promised LT=2). Pipeline inventory count (402) is unreliable due to this ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). The system reports 393 pipeline, but valid pipeline is 261. To correct this, mu_hat is explicitly inflated by ~132 units (set to 530) to force a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory. Lead time set to explicit 3.0 reflecting the repeated observation of LT=3 (P1->P4, P4->P7).

Carry-over insight: Lost order confirmed: P2 (132 units) never arrived (6 periods late); Pipeline count is inflated by 132. Lead time consistently hitting 3 periods (observed P4->P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. The pipeline inventory (375 units) is inflated by the Period 2 order (132 units), which is now 7 periods old (Promised LT=2) and confirmed lost. To correct for this 'ghost inventory', I am manually increasing mu_hat by 132 units. The observed lead time pattern alternates between 3 and 1 periods (recently LT=1 for Period 7 order, LT=3 for Period 4 order). I am adopting a conservative lead time estimate of 3 periods (Total horizon L+1=4). Average demand ~95. Target Base Demand = 95 units/period * 4 periods = 380. Adjusted mu_hat = 380 + 132 (ghost offset) = 512. This ensures the system orders replacement stock despite the inflated inventory count.

Carry-over insight: Lead time alternation pattern detected: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P7(1). Suggests possible high/low oscillation. P2 order (132 units) definitively lost, requiring permanent offset in planning parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand is 130. System pipeline is 333, but actual valid pipeline is likely only 69 (Period 9 order). The Period 2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 6 order (132 units) is now 4 periods old (Max historic LT=3) and did not arrive in Period 9 conclude; it is presumed lost, bringing total 'ghost' inventory to 264 units. Recent lead times have shortened to 1 period (observed P8, P9 arrivals), but instability remains. Demand avg (last 5) is ~90. To trigger replenishment despite the 264 ghost units inflating the system's view of inventory (System pos 463 vs Real 199), I act with `explicit` mu_hat set to ~550. This accounts for normal demand coverage (~280) plus the 264 ghost offset. This ensures we order ~100 units to cover real demand risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 6 order (132 units) confirmed lost/stuck; ordered P6, expected by P9 (max LT=3), not arrived. Total ghost inventory now 264 (P2 132 + P6 132). Recent lead time trend is 1 period (P7->P8, P8->P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $350.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Warning: Critical inventory levels. On-hand is 34 units. System reports 444 In-transit, but 264 of these are 'ghost' units from lost orders P2 (132) and P6 (132). Only 180 units are valid pipeline (P9, P10). Demand is volatile (zig-zag 76-96, avg ~87). To force the backend to order despite the inflated system inventory count, we must offset the standard target by the 264 ghost units. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety + Ghost = 3*95 + 46 + 264 = 595. This triggers an order of ~117 units to replenish valid stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Ghost Inventory accumulating: P6 order (132 units) confirmed lost (ordered P6, should arrive P9 latest, not arrived by end of P10). Total ghost inventory now 264 units (P2 132 + P6 132). Valid pipeline is only 180 units. Lead times holding unreliable 1-3 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 begins with 0 on-hand inventory and a reported in-transit pipeline of 566 units. However, 'Carry-Over Insights' confirm that orders from Period 2 (132 units) and Period 6 (132 units) are lost, creating 264 units of 'ghost inventory'. The valid pipeline is only 302 units (566 - 264). Recent orders (P9, P10, P11) are critical to cover demand, but the P9 order (69 units) has not arrived (current LT >= 3), breaking the recent LT=1 trend and increasing stockout risk. To prevent the system from under-ordering due to the inflated pipeline count, we must manually offset the ghost inventory in the target base stock. Average demand is ~85 units. A safe target for valid stock (covering L=3 uncertainty) is ~340 units. We set mu_hat to 600 (340 valid + 260 ghost) to maintain moderate replenishment orders (~35-60 units) and keep the valid pipeline robust against lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: P9 order did not arrive by P11 (LT>=3), breaking the recent LT=1 trend observed in P7-P8. Ghost inventory confirmed at 264 units (P2+P6), requiring permanent parameter offset.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 Status: On-hand=90. System In-transit=449. Analysis confirms 264 units of 'Ghost Inventory' (Order P2: 132 units lost; Order P6: 132 units lost). Real Pipeline = 449 - 264 = 185 units. Total Real Supply = 90 + 185 = 275. Recent demand avg ~88 (last 5 periods). Target coverage is 3 periods (Lead Time 2 + Review 1) @ ~95 units/period (safety buffer) = 285 units. Adjusted Target Base Stock = Real Target (285) + Ghost Offset (264) = ~549. Setting explicit forecast to 550 to force replenishment order of ~100 units, restoring real pipeline to safe levels despite valid stock counting as in-transit. Lead times remain volatile (mix of 1, 2, 3), so maintaining buffer is critical.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 264 units (Orders P2 & P6 lost). System pipeline (449) includes these lost units. Real Pipeline is only 185. Lead times stabilizing slightly (P10->P12 was 2, P9->P12 was 3) but volatility requires 3-period coverage buffer. Demand stable ~90. Offset strategy required indefinitely.

To compensate, we inflate mu_hat by +264 units (Ghost Inventory) above the base forecast. Demand forecast is set to 100 (conservative average vs recent 110). L set to 3 to reflect observed delays (P11 has not arrived by P13, exceeding promised LT=2). Target order brings real coverage to ~4.25 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Pipeline contains 264 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders P2 & P6) which artificially suppresses replenishment. System pipeline is 530, but valid inventory in transit is only 266 (P12+P13+P14). Demand is stable ~90/period. To maintain service, we need real coverage of ~4 periods (Review 1 + Lead Time 3) = ~400 units. To achieve a real stock position of 400, the system target must be set to 400 (desired) + 264 (ghost) = 664. We use 'explicit' mu_hat=664 to force this target. L=3 assumed as P12 order exceeded LT=2.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 264 units (P2+P6 lost). Actual pipeline is 266 vs system 530. Lead time assumption set to 3 periods (P12 order did not arrive P14, implied LT>=3). Permanent parameter offset required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: On-hand 0, System Pipeline 561. Two major lost orders (P2: 132 units & P6: 132 units) create 264 units of 'ghost inventory', meaning valid pipeline is only 297 (561-264). Recent arrivals (P11->P14, P12->P15) confirm actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, despite promised 2. Demand is volatile with spikes to 112. Strategy: Use explicit L=3 to match reality. Use explicit mu_hat=715 to effectively set a Base Stock of 715. This target compensates for the ghost inventory (715 - 264 = 451 real target) and ensures sufficient coverage for 4 periods (L+1) at ~105 units/period plus safety stock, aiming to recover from current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilizing at 3 periods (consistent observations P11->P14, P12->P15). Ghost inventory confirmed fixed at 264 units (Lost orders from P2 & P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current State: On-hand is 0, effective pipeline is only 440 units (P14 191 + P15 94 + P16 155), but system reports 704 units. The difference (264 units) is 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Period 2 and 6. Lead time is consistently observed as 3 periods (orders from P11, P12, P13 arrived in P14, P15, P16 respectively).

Action: To compensate for the 264 units of non-existent inventory the system thinks it has, we inflate 'mu_hat' by 264. We also set L=3 explicitly to match recent reality (up from promised 2). 

Calculation for mu_hat: Demand estimate based on recent 5-period average (approx 94.4) over L+1 (4 periods) = 377.6. Adding ghost offset (264) = 641.6. Rounding to 642. Sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently 3 periods (P13 order arrived P16). Ghost inventory accounts for 264 units of the 704 in-transit (Real pipeline 440). Parameter offset necessary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-81.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: On-hand inventory is high (293 units) due to the simultaneous arrival of the P14 order (LT=3) and the P16 order (LT=1, unusually fast) in Period 17. The P15 order (94 units) was skipped by the P16 shipment and is still in transit (elapsed time 2 periods); based on the prevalent LT=3 pattern, it is expected Period 18. Ghost inventory is confirmed at 264 units (P2+P6 orders lost). Actual pipeline inventory is 94 units (P15 order). Total Real Inventory Position is 293 + 94 = 387, which provides ~4.3 periods of coverage at an average demand of 90. This is adequate. Demand dropped to 53 in P17, but we maintain a forecast of 90 (avg of last 5 periods approx 87) to prevent under-reaction. Parameters are set with an explicit offset to neutralize the 264 units of phantom inventory in the system.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 264 (P2+P6). Lead time order crossover observed: P16 arrived (LT=1) before P15 (LT>=2). Dominant lead time assumption remains 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-143.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19. Context: Demand has plummeted drastically over the last 3 periods (112 -> 78 -> 53 -> 30), a 73% drop. We are currently holding massive excess inventory (263 on-hand + 110 real pipeline) relative to this new demand level (~30-50/period), providing >7 periods of coverage. Additionally, the P15 order (ordered Period 15) has not arrived after 4 periods (expected 2-3), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed, joining the existing 'ghost' inventory of 264 units (P2+P6). Total system pipeline (374) includes 264 ghost units + 94 late units + 16 new units. Given the high stock and crashing demand, the optimal move is to order 0. We set parameters to reflect the recent demand drop (recent_N=3) and conservative lead time (3) to ensure accurate safety stock calculation for the future, though the order quantity will naturally be capped at 0 due to the inventory position (637 total) exceeding any reasonable target.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed: P15(112) -> P18(30), a ~73% decline. P15 order (94 units) overdue (4 periods passed). Ghost inventory stable at 264 (P2+P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has crashed and sustained a low level (avg ~44 units for P17-P19). Lead time analysis indicates the P15 order (94 units) is lost, as it is now 5 periods post-order without arrival (max observed LT=3). Total Ghost Inventory is now 358 units (P2:132 + P6:132 + P15:94). Current on-hand (213) covers ~4-5 periods of demand, so immediate ordering is not required. Parameters are offset to account for ghost inventory while preventing overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand depression confirmed: Avg ~44 units (P17-P19). Ghost inventory update: P15 order (94 units) deemed lost (5 periods elapsed). New Total Ghost Inventory: 358 units (P2 132 + P6 132 + P15 94).

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 demand rebounded to 86, suggesting the demand crash (P18:30, P19:50) may have stabilized or reversed; using 86 as the planning baseline. Ghost inventory remains at 358 units (Lost orders: P2 132 + P6 132 + P15 94). System in-transit is 374, meaning real valid pipeline is only 16 units (Order P18). To trigger replenishment despite the system's inflated inventory view, 'mu_hat' is explicitly set to cover (L+1) demand + Ghost Inventory offset. Targeted real base stock ~400 (4 periods * 86 + safety) requires a system parameter of ~758 (400 real need + 358 ghost offset). Lead time set to 3 periods as P18 order (ordered P18) has not arrived by start of P21.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled: Period 20 demand (86) broke the low-demand trend of P18-P19. Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 358 units (P2+P6+P15). Valid pipeline is critically low (16 units).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
STATUS ANALYSIS:
- Current On-hand: 61 units.
- Pipeline: 580 units (In-transit).
- Ghost Inventory (Confirmed Lost): 358 units (P2: 132 + P6: 132 + P15: 94). These orders are indefinitely overdue and will never arrive.
- Valid Pipeline: 580 - 358 = 222 units (Orders P18: 16, P21: 206).
- Recent Demand: P20=86, P21=66. The low-demand 'crash' (P18-19: 30-50 units) appears to be ending, returning to ~76 avg.
- Effective Position: 61 (on-hand) + 222 (valid pipe) = 283 units.

FORECAST & PARAMETERS:
- Target Coverage: We need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods (assuming conservative L=3). Avg demand ~80 -> Target ~320 units.
- Gap to Target: 320 (Target) - 283 (Effective Position) = 37 units needed.
- Ghost Offset: The system calculates stock gap using the full pipeline 580. To force it to order more, we must inflate the target parameters. 
- Inflation Calculation: We need the backend to see a base stock of roughly (Target + 358 Ghost). Target ~320 + 358 = 678.
- Method: Set 'explicit' mu_hat to achieve this high base stock. Base Stock approx = mu_hat + z*sigma. 
- Chosen mu_hat: Set to 680 (Target 320 + Ghost 358). This compensates for the system 'seeing' the lost 358 units as valid stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand Recovery Confirmed: P20(86) and P21(66) signal end of slump; average stabilized ~76. Ghost inventory remains 358 units (P2/P6/P15 lost).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 Context: On-hand is lean (24), but a large order from P21 (206 units) is incoming, providing adequate future coverage for the current low/volatile demand (avg ~54, recent low 37). Lead times remain unstable, with P18 (16 units) now overdue by 2 periods (likely lost), and P15, P6, P2 definitively lost. Total 'Ghost Inventory' (physically lost but system-counted items) is estimated at 374 units (132+132+94+16). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost stock as usable inventory and ordering 0, we explicitly set `mu_hat` to encompass both Real Demand Needs (~300 units for 4 periods) and the Ghost Offset (~374 units). Target Base Stock ~680 against System Position 677 leads to a minimal/maintenance order, avoiding overstock while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory updated to 374 units (P2 132 + P6 132 + P15 94 + P18 16 provisional). P18 order is 2 periods overdue. Demand volatility continues (P22 dropped to 37).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 observations: On-hand inventory is high (283 units) following recent arrivals, while demand has crashed to a new low (20 units in Period 23). Valid pipeline is only 12 units (Period 23 order), but the system shows 386 due to 'ghost' orders (P2, P6, P15, P18) totaling 374 units. Despite this ghost inventory distortion, no offset is applied to mu_hat this period because the physical on-hand stock (283) heavily exceeds the target stock for the current low demand (avg ~41), effectively making the inventory 'long'. The goal is to trigger 0 orders to burn down holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect the newly normalized lead times (1-2 periods) and the sharp demand drop (using N=3).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 374 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). Demand in deep decline (P23=20). Lead times normalizing to 1-2 periods (observed in P23 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-103.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: Demand remains in a depressed regime (avg ~40 units over last 4 periods). Inventory is currently overstocked (247 units on-hand) relative to this low demand (~6-8 periods of coverage), so no immediate order is needed. However, the system Pipeline (386 units) is heavily inflated by 'Ghost Inventory' (374 units from lost orders P2, P6, P15, P18). To ensure the system triggers orders correctly when on-hand inventory eventually depletes, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to include the 374-unit offset plus a conservative demand forecast (40 units/period * 3 periods = 120). Lead times appearing stable at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand depression persists (avg ~40 units P21-P25). Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 374 units (Lost orders: P2 132 + P6 132 + P15 94 + P18 16). Real pipeline is 12 units (P23 order).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory is confirmed at 374 units (active pipeline is 0). System sees 582 total stock (208 on-hand + 374 ghost) vs real need of ~150-200. To force a replenishment order, mu_hat is explicitly set to 525 (Real demand estimate ~150 + Ghost offset 374). Lead time set to 2 as arrivals P23->P25 confirm promised LT is holding again.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 374 units (P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). Real pipeline is 0. Recent demand low (avg ~42) but stable. Lead time stabilized at 2 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27. Ghost inventory is confirmed stable at 374 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). System reports 374 in-transit, but real pipeline is 0. On-hand is 156. Demand has stabilized around 50 units (P25=51, P26=52). To restart replenishment, we must offset the ghost inventory. Desired real coverage is ~(L+1)*Demand + Safety \u2248 3*50 + 50 = 200. Total Target Base Stock must be 200 (Real) + 374 (Ghost) = 574. Setting mu_hat=555 and sigma_hat=25 yields Base Stock \u2248 555 + 0.84*25 \u2248 576. This triggers an order of ~46 units (576 - 530) to replenish the empty real pipeline before on-hand stocks out in ~3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 374 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). Real pipeline is 0. Demand stabilizing ~50 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Demand is recovering (P25:51, P26:52, P27:58) after a crash. We forecast ~62 units/period. Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (observed in P23/P25 arrivals). Critical issue: 'Ghost' inventory (orders lost but counted in 'In-transit') confuses the OR engine. Lost orders: P2(132), P6(132), P15(94), P18(16). Total Ghost Inventory = 374 units. Real pipeline is 47 units (P27), Total In-transit is 421 (47 real + 374 ghost). To clear the backlog and maintain service, we offset mu_hat. Target Real Inventory = 3 periods * 62 demand = 186. Target System Base Stock = 186 + 374 (Ghost) = 560. We use L=2 (default), explicit mu_hat=560, and explicit sigma_hat=15 to achieve this order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 374 units (Lost orders P2, P6, P15, P18). Real pipeline is valid (Period 27 order). Demand recovery trend confirmed (avg 54 last 3 periods). Lead time stable at 2 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Ghost inventory persists at 374 units (Lost orders: P2 132, P6 132, P15 94, P18 16). System reports 475 in-transit, but the valid pipeline is only 101 units (P27 47 + P28 54). Demand has stabilized after the recovery, averaging 49 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28). Lead time reliability has improved, with recent arrivals (P21, P23) confirming a 2-period lead time. To compensate for the 374 units of ghost inventory inflating the system pipeline, we use an explicit mu_hat. Calculation: (AvgDemand 49 * (L+1 3)) + GhostOffset 374 = 147 + 374 = 521. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover true demand despite the phantom pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 374 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). System pipeline (475) minus Ghost (374) equals Real Pipeline (101). Demand stable ~49 units (P24-P28 avg). Lead time stable at 2 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 374 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18 lost), inflating system in-transit to 437 while real pipeline is only 63 units (orders from P28, P29). Demand has stabilized in the 50-60 range (avg ~53 over last 5 periods). Lead time observed stable at 2 periods. To trigger correct replenishment, we offset the ghost inventory in mu_hat: Target Demand (60 units * 3 periods = 180) + Ghost (374) = 554. We use recent_N=5 for sigma to capture the current low-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 374 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). Real pipeline matches recent orders (63 units). Demand stable ~53 units. Lead time stable at 2 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory remains confirmed at 374 units (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18), distorting the system's pipeline view (464 reported vs 90 actual). To correct this, we use the explicit mu_hat method to offset the phantom inventory. Use formula: Value = EstMeanDemand + GhostInventory/(L+1). With recent demand averaging ~55 units and stable lead time of 2 periods, we calculate 58 + 374/3 \u2248 183 (using 58 as a conservative demand estimate). We set value to 185 to ensure stock recovery. Lead time is set to explicit 2 based on consistent recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 374 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18 lost). System pipeline (464) minus Ghost (374) equals Real Pipeline (90). Demand stable ~55 units (P26-P30 avg). Lead time stable at 2 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory remains confirmed at 374 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18). System reports 464 in-transit, implying real pipeline is 90 units (matches P29+P30 orders). To trigger replenishment despite the massive phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly to encompass the summation of real demand during lead time (~165) plus the ghost offset (374), totaling ~540. Recent lead times are stable at 2.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 374 units. Real pipeline is 90 units (P29+P30). Lead time stable at 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Accumulating lost orders are creating a massive discrepancy between system pipeline and real inventory. Orders from Period 29 (9 units) and Period 30 (81 units) are now overdue relative to the promised 2-period lead time, appearing to join the 'ghost inventory' pile alongside lost orders from P2, P6, P15, and P18. The current system pipeline of 579 units effectively contains 464 units of ghost inventory (374 historical + 90 new overdue), leaving only 115 valid units (from Period 32) incoming. With 0 on-hand and demand averaging ~40-50 units despite recent dips, an immediate aggressive restocking is required. I am targeting a real physical position of ~300 units (covering ~5-6 periods of demand) to buffer against future failures. To achieve this, I must offset the 464 ghost units in the base stock. Target Base Stock = 300 (Real Desired) + 464 (offset) = 764. I am keeping L at default to maximize the order cap allowance.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Ghost inventory expanded to 464 units (Historical: P2, P6, P15, P18 + New Overdue: P29 9u, P30 81u). Valid pipeline is only 115 units (P32 order). Demand remains volatile (recent low of 24-30). Lead time failures recurring.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Orders P29 (9u) and P30 (81u) have not arrived despite P32 arriving in P33 (LT=1). This indicates P29 and P30 are lost/stuck, adding 90 units to the Ghost Inventory. Total Ghost Inventory is now 374 + 90 = 464 units. System pipeline is 693, so valid pipeline is 229 (matches P33 order). To compensate for the 464 units of phantom stock that the engine mistakenly counts as coverage, I am adding them to the demand forecast. Base demand est 60/period * 3 periods + 464 offset = 644.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Ghost inventory confirmed at 464 units (Historical 374 + New Lost P29 9u + P30 81u). Orders P29 and P30 likely lost as P32 (ordered later) arrived in P33 (LT=1). Valid pipeline is only 229 units (P33 order).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 begins with critical on-hand inventory (34 units). We rely on the arrival of the Period 33 order (229 units) during Period 35 (implying Lead Time=2) to satisfy demand and avoid stockout. This order is the only valid unit in the pipeline. Ghost inventory has officially increased to 464 units, as orders from P29 (9 units) and P30 (81 units) are confirmed lost following the arrival of the later P32 order (crossover). Consequently, the system-reported In-transit (693) is inflated by 464 lost units; the Real Pipeline is 229. Given the Real Pipeline covers >5 periods of current demand (avg ~40), no replenishment is needed now. We use recent history parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and explicitly set L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory increased to 464 units (Historical 374 + P29 9u + P30 81u confirmed lost via P32 crossover). Valid pipeline is 229 units (P33 order). Critical stockout risk in P35 if P33 order does not arrive immediately (LT=2).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Stockout occurred in Period 35. Ghost inventory confirmed at 464 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30 lost). System in-transit (693) implies ample stock, but Real Pipeline is only 229 units (the P33 order). This P33 order is currently delayed (ordered P33, promised LT=2, now P36 decision phase with no arrival, implies Actual LT >= 3). To maintain service, we target Real Inventory Position of ~280 (Demand ~55 * 5 periods coverage). Required System IP = 280 + 464 (Ghost) = 744. We use explicit L=3 to reflect current delays and explicit mu=186 (since 186 * (1+3) = 744) to force the necessary replenishment order of ~51 units despite the ghost inflation.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 464 units (P2/P6/P15/P18/P29/P30 lost). P33 order (229 units) delayed (Actual LT >= 3). Stockout confirmed P35. Demand volatility continues (~18-63 units).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory confirmed at 464 units (adding P29 and P30 to the lost list). The system sees 693 units in transit, but only 229 (P33 order) are potentially valid. P33 is also overdue (4 periods since order). To trigger replenishment despite the massive phantom pipeline, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that includes the real demand forecast (~150 for 3 periods) plus the ghost inventory offset (464).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 464 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30 lost). Order P33 (229 units) is now overdue (4 periods vs promised 2), risking stockout continuation.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
CRITICAL SITUATION: Total System In-transit (693 units) exactly matches the sum of suspected lost orders (Historical 464 + Period 33's 229 units). The Period 33 order is now 4 periods past order date (Promised LT=2) and confirmed lost. Real pipeline inventory is 0. We are stocked out with unfulfilled demand. I must offset the 693 units of 'ghost' inventory to force a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 950 targets a Base Stock of ~960, minus 693 ghost units = valid order of ~267 units (approx 5 periods of supply) to restart the supply chain. Low sigma and L=2 keep the cap high enough to permit this recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 693 units (Historical 464 + P33 229u lost). Total System In-transit (693) is entirely phantom inventory. Real Pipeline is 0. Critical stockouts ongoing since Period 35. P33 order failed to arrive by Period 37 (LT>=4 vs promised 2).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: Stockouts continue. Ghost inventory calculation updated: Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, and now P33 (229 units, 6 periods late) are lost. Total Ghost Inventory = 693 units. Real pipeline is only 274 units (P38 order). To execute replenishment, we must offset the 693 phantom units. Recent demand avg ~55. Target Base Stock = (3 periods * 55) + 693 ghost = 858. Setting mu_hat to 858 to force immediate order.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 693 units (Historical 464 + P33 229u lost). Total System In-transit (967) is mostly phantom. Real Pipeline is 274 (P38 order). P33 order definitely lost (6 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory is confirmed at 693 units (System In-transit 693 - Real Pipeline 0). The most recent order P38 arrived in 1 period (P39), but the P33 order (229 units) is definitively lost. P39 demand (62) confirms the recovery trend. Current on-hand (212) covers ~3.5 periods, but with 0 real pipeline, we must order immediately to avoid future stockouts. To overcome the ghost inventory preventing orders (System Inventory 905 > Normal Base Stock), we set an explicit mu_hat of 900. This targets a Base Stock of ~970 (900 + safety), triggering an order of ~65 units (970 - 905), ensuring real coverage of ~4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 693 units (Historical 464 + P33 229u lost). System In-transit (693) is entirely phantom; Real Pipeline is 0. Demand recovery sustained ~62 units (last 3 periods). P38 order arrived in 1 period (LT=1), though long-term volatility requires assuming LT=2-3 buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory (693 units) continues to block ordering. System sees 732 in-transit (147 on-hand), but 693 of that is lost. Real pipeline is 39. To trigger a replenishment order of ~90 units (covering demand + safety), we must set the target base stock to 'System Inventory + Desired Order' = 879 + 90 = 969. We set mu_hat explicitly to 969 to force this ordering behavior despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 693 units (Historical 464 + P33 229u lost). Total System In-transit (732) is mostly phantom (only 39u real). Real Pipeline is 39 (Order P40). Demand stable ~63 units. Massive parameter offset required indefinitely.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Ghost inventory confirmed steady at 693 units (Lost orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). System In-transit is 831, implying Real Pipeline is 138 (Orders P40: 39u, P41: 99u). Neither arrived in P41, indicating Lead Time has shifted from 1 (observed for P38 order) to >=2 again. Current On-hand (103) + Real Pipeline (138) = 241 units, providing ~4 periods of coverage against demand ~60. Strategy: Set parameters to maintain a System Base Stock of ~945 (252 Real + 693 Ghost), ensuring continued coverage despite phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 693 units (Historical lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). Real pipeline is 138 units (P40, P41). Lead time volatility persists: P38 was LT=1, but P40 is LT>=2 (not arrived P41). Demand stable ~58 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. System shows 843 units in-transit, but 693 of these are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from previous lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). The real pipeline is only 150 units (Orders P40, P41, P42). Additionally, Order P40 (39 units) is overdue (Promised LT=2, current elapsed=3), currently risking a stockout in ~3 periods if it is lost. Demand is stable (~55 units/period). To maintain a real base stock of ~220 units (providing ~4 periods of coverage given supply unreliability), I must offset the 693 ghost units. Target System Mu = 693 (Ghost) + 220 (Real Target) = 913.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 693 units (Historical lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). Real pipeline is 150 units (P40, P41, P42). Order P40 (39 units) is overdue (LT>=3 vs promised 2), potentially becoming a new lost order. Demand stable ~55 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory confirmed at 693 units (System 830 - Real 137 = 693). Real pipeline consists of P41(99), P42(12), P43(26). Total Real Net Inventory is 66 (on-hand) + 137 (pipe) = 203 units. With demand averaging ~55 and Lead Time confirmed at 3 periods (P40 arrived P43, LT=3), we require (3+1) periods of coverage plus safety stock (~250-280 units). Current coverage is ~3.7 periods, which is tight. To achieve target real inventory of ~260, we set system parameters to target ~260 + 693 (ghost) = 953. P41 is overdue (LT>=3), reinforcing the need for L=3 buffer.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed 3 periods (P40 order arrived P43). P41 order overdue (LT>=3 implied). Ghost inventory stable at 693 units. Real pipeline is 137 units (P41, P42, P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: Ghost Inventory remains at 693 units (confirmed by matching system total 778 minus calculated real pipeline 85). Real pipeline consists of orders P42(12), P43(26), P44(47). Lead times for recent arrivals (P40, P41) were consistently 3 periods, confirming an extended lead time regime. Demand has averaged ~45 units recently. With System Inventory (On-hand 123 + In-transit 778 = 901) grossly inflated by lost orders, an explicit offset is required to trigger replenishment. We anticipate tightening stock levels by P47/P48. Setting explicit target base stock ~935 to induce an order of ~34 units to cover the L=3 horizon plus safety stock, ensuring continuity through Period 48.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed stable at 693 units (Historical lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). Real pipeline is 85 units (P42, P43, P44). Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods (P40, P41 arrivals).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Ghost inventory remains confirmed at 693 units (Lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). System In-Transit (774) minus Ghost (693) equals Real Pipeline (81 units: P44(47) + P45(34)), satisfying verification. Recent arrivals show lead times oscillating between 3 periods (P40, P41, P42) and 2 periods (P43). Demand has stabilized around 40-45 units. 

Strategy: The system calculates Inventory Position as ~893 (119 On-hand + 774 In-transit). To trigger a replenishment order of ~67 units (covering ~1.5 weeks demand) to maintain pipeline flow, I must target a base stock of ~960. Using strict Lost-Sales/Ghost offset logic: 
Parameter choice:
1. L='explicit' value 3.0 (Prudent estimate given recent history).
2. mu_hat='explicit' value 240. Calculation: Base Stock \u2248 (1+L) * value = 4 * 240 = 960. Order = 960 - 893 = 67.
3. sigma_hat='default' (Normal volatility).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 693 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). Real pipeline validated at 81 units (P44, P45). Lead time mix of 3 periods (P42 arrival) and 2 periods (P43 arrival) suggests congestion clearing but risk remains high. Demand stable ~42 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Ghost inventory confirmed at 693 units. Real inventory position is 162 units (81 on-hand + 81 pipeline from P44, P45). Demand is stable around 40 units/period. Recent observed lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods; assuming L=3 is safer. We need to cover 4 periods of demand (approx 160 units) plus safety stock. Current real position (162) is barely adequate for L=3 mean demand. We target a real base stock of ~205 units to build buffer. System sees 855 units (162 real + 693 ghost). We set mu_hat to 900 (207 real target + 693 ghost) to force an order of ~45 units, ensuring coverage against potential lead time slips.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 693 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). Real pipeline is 81 units (P44, P45). Lead time mix of 3 periods (dominant) and 2 periods suggests assuming L=3. Demand stable ~40 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 of 50. Approaching end of game. Critical context: On-hand is 21 units versus stable demand ~55-60. System In-transit (820) is heavily inflated by confirmed Ghost Inventory (693 units). Real pipeline is at most 127 units, but Orders P44 (47u) and P45 (34u) are overdue (LT>=4 and LT>=3 respectively), suggesting they may also be lost. Immediate stockout logic applies. To force replenishment for the final 2 periods (P49, P50) despite the phantom inventory, I am applying a massive offset to 'mu_hat'. An order placed now (P48) can serve P49 demand (if LT=1) or P50 demand (if LT=2). Given recent volatility, ordering is low-risk/high-reward. Setting L=3 to reflect recent slow arrivals, and mu_hat=1000 to neutralize ghost inventory and buffer against potential loss of P44/P45.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 693 units (Historical lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33). Real pipeline at risk: P44 (47u) is overdue (LT>=4 implied), P45 (34u) is overdue (LT>=3 implied). Demand recently spiked to 60 (P47).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 of 50. Approaching end of horizon. Orders P44 (47 units) and P45 (34 units) are confirmed lost due to excessive delay (5 and 4 periods elapsed respectively vs max observed 3). Ghost inventory rises to 774 units (693 historical + 47 + 34). Total system in-transit is 1029, implying a Real Pipeline of 255 units (Orders P47, P48). With only 2 periods remaining and current Lead Time trend of 2-3 periods, any order placed now would likely arrive after the game ends. The existing real pipeline (255 units) is sufficient to cover remaining demand (estimated ~110 units). Parameters set to reflect recent demand but no offset actions taken as suppression of new orders is the desired behavior.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory updated to 774 units (Historical 693 + New Lost: P44 47u, P45 34u). Real pipeline is 255 units (P47, P48). Lead times remain high (3 periods typical).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 Context: Critical stockout occurred in Period 49 (0 sold vs 41 demand). On-hand is 0. System 'In-transit' is 1029, but 774 units are confirmed Ghost Inventory (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33, P44, P45). Valid pipeline is only 255 units (P47 46u + P48 209u). With Lead Time observed at 3 periods (P43, P44 samples), we must cover 4 periods of demand (approx 55-60/period). Calculating (L+1)*Demand = 240 units. Current valid pipeline (255) barely covers this expectancy, leaving no safety buffer for the high demand variance (peaks of 64) or potential loss of P47. Applying aggressive offset: mu_hat = (Forecast 260 + Ghost 774 + Buffer 50) = 1084 to force a top-up order and maintain service level.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory stable at 774 units (Lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P29, P30, P33, P44, P45). Real pipeline comprised of P47 (46u) and P48 (209u). P49 stockout confirms need for continued high offsets.
