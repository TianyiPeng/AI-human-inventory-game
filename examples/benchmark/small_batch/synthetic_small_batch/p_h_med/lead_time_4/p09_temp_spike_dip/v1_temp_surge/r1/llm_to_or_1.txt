Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Initializing inventory parameters based on 5 periods of historical data. The historical average demand is approx. 114 units/period with moderate volatility. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 inventory, the system needs to order enough to cover the review period plus lead time (1+4=5 periods). I will use the 'default' method which utilizes the full historical dataset provided to estimate mean and variance, and relies on the promised lead time of 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2. Only one period of realized demand (86) exists, which is lower than the provided historical sample for Period 1 (131). The historical average is ~114. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), it is risky to lower the forecast significantly based on a single data point. I am setting an explicit demand forecast based on an estimated mean of 110/period over the risk horizon of L+1=5 periods (110*5=550). I am slightly elevating sigma to account for the deviation between historical and realized values. Lead time remains default (4) as no arrivals have occurred to validate/refute it.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3. Current on-hand is 0 with 285 units in transit. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders from Period 1 arrive in Period 5 (visible Period 6). No arrivals expected yet. Observed demand (86, 132) is volatile but averages ~109, which is close to the provided historical sample mean of 114. Combining provided samples and game history gives a robust mean of ~113 and std dev ~20-25. Using explicit parameters to reflect this combined history for a 5-period protection interval (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4. No arrivals yet, consistent with promised lead time of 4. Demand history (observed + pre-game) shows a stable mean around 111. Using recent_N=8 to capture all available data points for robust mean and variance estimation. Pipeline inventory is building up as expected.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5. Observed demand (P1-P4) averages 98.25 units/period (range 75-132), which is lower than the pre-game static example data (114). I prioritize the active simulation logs. With promised Lead Time 4, the first order (from P1) is expected to arrive during P5 (visible in P5 conclude). Observed history (P1-P4 concludes showing 0 arrivals) is consistent with L=4. Current pipeline (581 units) exceeds the target inventory for protection interval (L+1=5 periods @ ~100 demand = ~500 units). System will likely order 0 to align inventory. Using recent_N=4 for demand parameters to adapt to the observed mean of ~98.

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Period 5 conclude confirmed the first order arrival (ordered P1, arrived P5), validating the promised lead time of 4 periods. No missing shipments detected (in-transit 440 matches orders from P2, P3, P4). Demand over the last 5 periods (P1-P5) has averaged ~99.8 units/period with some volatility (std dev ~22). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the actual realized demand statistics for the base stock calculation. All inventory accounting is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $206.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5 and P6). Demand in the current game (avg ~96) is running lower than the historical training samples (avg ~114) and exhibits significant variance (75-132). Current pipeline is robust (361 units) with a large arrival (155 units) expected this period. I will use 'recent_N=6' for demand parameters to base the forecast on the actual realized demand of this run, ignoring the higher historical priors. Lead time remains 'default' as promised matches actual.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as stable 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 7 conclude message). Demand analysis shows a downward trend/shift: the average demand for the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 81.25, significantly lower than the P1-P3 average of 106. Given the holding cost and the high on-hand (190) + in-transit (264) inventory relative to this lower demand, I will switch to shorter-term estimators. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the forecast with this lower demand regime while disregarding the noisier early periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand shifting lower: Avg of last 4 periods (P4-P7) is ~81, compared to P1-P3 avg ~106.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: On-hand inventory is healthy at 204. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 4 order arrived in Period 8). The previous hypothesis of a 'demand shift lower' (Period 8 insight) was invalidated by Period 8's high demand of 127, which indicates high volatility rather than a sustained decrease. The demand pattern over the last 5 periods (75, 106, 77, 67, 127) shows a mean of ~90.4 but significant variance. We switch to recent_N=5 for demand and variance parameters to capture this volatility and the recent spike, preventing stockouts if demand remains high, while acknowledging the dip periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 8 spike (127) invalidates the 'lower shift' hypothesis observed in P4-P7; demand range is wide (67-127).

Daily Reward (R_t): $346.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Lead time consistency is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 4 order arrived in Period 8; Period 5 order was 0, correctly resulting in 0 arrivals in Period 9). Demand volatility remains the primary challenge: after a low dip in P6-P7 (avg ~72), demand rebounded in P8-P9 (avg ~118). Consequently, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this localized high variance and current mean (~97) rather than the higher pre-game samples. This ensures the 5-period protection interval is sized for the current erratic behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 6 order arrived in Period 10). Demand has shown a sustained rebound in the last 3 periods (P8-P10 values: 127, 110, 108), averaging 115 units, compared to the overall historical average of ~99 and the dip in P6-P7. To capture this higher demand regime without stocking out, we switch mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3. However, since the recent 3 periods show artificially low volatility (Standard Deviation ~8.5) compared to the full history (Standard Deviation ~21), we keep sigma_hat on 'default' to ensure adequate safety stock buffering against proven volatility ranges (67-132).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound sustained: Last 3 periods (P8-P10) average 115 units, significantly above the P6-P7 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 12. Context: Demand remains strong and volatile. After a dip in P6-P7 (avg ~72), demand has rebounded significantly in P8-P11 (avg ~117.5), showing sustained high activity. The last 4 periods were 127, 110, 108, 125. This confirms that the earlier dip was temporary. Lead Time: Observed lead times consistently confirm 4 periods (P7 order arrived P11). No evidence of drift. Inventory: We stocked out in Period 11 (demand 125 > available 109), resulting in lost sales. This signals that our previous restocking was too conservative for this high-demand regime. Strategy: I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this high-volume regime specifically (P8-P11), ignoring the older dip data. Lead time remains default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: Avg of P8-P11 is ~117.5, fully recovering from the P6-P7 dip (~72).

LLM Rationale:
Demand continues to hold the high-demand regime established in Period 8. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is approximately 119 units, significantly higher than the dip observed in P6-P7. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the P9 order arriving in P13 (13-9=4). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to exclusively capture this new high-demand plateau and ignore the lower, outdated statistics from earlier periods. This ensures the base stock is elevated to match current consumption rates. The order from P10 (139 units) is expected to arrive during Period 14, which will replenish the low starting on-hand inventory (20 units) before demand is resolved.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals in P10-P14 matching orders from P6-P10). Demand in Period 14 (98) dipped slightly below the recent 100+ trend, but the average over the current high-demand regime (starting Period 8) remains brisk at ~116 units. I am maintaining the 'recent_N' length of 7 (covering P8-P14) for both mean and volatility to capture the full extent of this active regime without overreacting to the single lower data point in P14. The heavy in-transit volume (456 units) matches expected outstanding orders exactly, confirming no supply chain losses.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists: Average demand from Period 8 to Period 14 is ~116, sustaining well above the older dip (P6-P7 avg ~72), though P14 (98) showed slight cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: The high demand regime continues to show stability. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P8-P15) is approximately 116 units, with Period 15 (114) aligning perfectly with this mean. The earlier dip (P6-P7) is now firmly in the past and should not influence current forecasts. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 11 order in Period 15. We utilize 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand estimation to capture the entirety of this high-demand active regime. Current on-hand (97) plus the incoming shipment from Period 12 (134 units) provides ample coverage for immediate demand.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed stable: Avg P8-P15 is ~116 units, sustaining well above historical dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $744.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 saw a massive demand spike to 195 units (historical max), significantly exceeding the prior 'high regime' average of ~116. With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the cost of stocking out is high, so parameters must react to this potential new volatility/level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory (370) exactly matches orders from P13-P16, confirming no losses. I will switch to recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to incorporate the P16 spike ~20% into the mean and significantly widen the safety stock buffer (via sigma), protecting service levels if this spike signals a new trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P16 (195 units) sets new record, exceeding previous high regime avg (~116) by ~68%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: Critical stockout occurred in P17 (demand 251 > on-hand 104). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P13 order arrived P17). A drastic demand surge is confirmed: P16 (195) and P17 (251) are double the previous 'high' regime average (~116). The trend is aggressively upward (114 -> 195 -> 251). Current pipeline (496) is insufficient for 5 periods of this new demand level (~1100+ needed). I am switching to a very short-memory forecast (recent_N=3) to immediately adapt to this new intense demand level and prevent further lost sales, as long-term averages would severely underestimate requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P16-P17 average 223 units, significantly exceeding prior regime (~116); P17 set new record at 251.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has undergone a massive regime shift starting Period 16. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is ~212 units, nearly double the prior stable average of ~116 (P8-P15). This surge caused stockouts in P17 and P18. Pipeline inventory (692) is insufficient to cover 5 periods of this new demand level (~1060 units). I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu and sigma to aggressively target this new high-demand regime and replenish safety stock immediately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 order arrived P18).

Carry-over insight: Demand explosion confirmed: P16-P18 average ~212 units, marking an ~82% increase over the prior P8-P15 regime (~116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 decision. 'In-transit' is 873 units, on-hand is 0. Demand has surged dramatically in the last 4 periods (P16:195, P17:251, P18:189, P19:177). The average over these last 4 periods (P16-P19) is ~203 units, which is a massive leap from the prior regime's ~116 avg. Although P19 cooled slightly to 177, it remains far above historical norms. The 'In-transit' covers roughly 4.3 periods of this new high demand (873/203 \u2248 4.3), which is close to the target of L+1 = 5 periods. However, given the volatility and stockouts (zero inventory for 3 periods running), we must aggressively update the forecast parameters to reflect this new reality. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 15 order arrived Period 19). I will set explicit forecast parameters based on the most recent 4-period high-demand regime to prevent under-ordering.

Carry-over insight: New High Demand Regime sustained: P16-P19 avg is ~203 units, nearly double the prior P8-P15 avg (~116).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21. Stockout persists (0 on-hand). The high demand regime starting in Period 16 is sustained, with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging ~213 units/period (range 177-254), significantly higher than the prior P8-P15 average of ~116. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (promised). To address the stockouts and ensuring parameters reflect the new demand reality, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5. This window captures the entire high-demand regime (P16-P20) while excluding the irrelevant lower demand data prior to P16, properly calibrating the base stock for the current surge.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P20): Average demand ~213 units, significantly above previous baseline (~116), with continued volatility (range 177-254).

Daily Reward (R_t): $776.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P17 order arriving in P21). The supply chain is recovering from a massive demand surge that began in P16; we have stocked out for 5 consecutive periods, but a large wave of replenishment (941 units in-transit) is approaching, with the oldest order (300 units from P18) expected to arrive during this period. Demand remains in a high-volume regime (P16-P21 avg ~217 units), significantly above the historical baseline. I am retaining 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mean and volatility to accurately target this new level (avg ~217, std ~34) and ensure the base stock calculation covers the elevated risk.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P21): Avg ~217 units, maintaining ~87% lift over historical baseline, though volatility remains high (std ~34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand (250) confirms the high-demand regime (started P16) is sustained and robust. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged approx. 222 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~116. Inventory is stabilizing with 50 units on-hand and 268 arriving this period (Period 19 order). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Parameters are set using 'recent_N = 7' to capture the full extent of this new high-demand regime while excluding older, irrelevant lower demand data.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P22): Average demand ~222 units, nearly double the P8-P15 baseline, with high volatility (range 177-254).

Daily Reward (R_t): $602.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. The high demand regime (Period 16+) continues with significant strength. Average demand since the changepoint at Period 16 (P16-P23) is approx 217 units, vastly higher than the historical baseline. While volatility is high (ranges ~177-254), P23 demand dropped slightly to 184, recovering some inventory (ending on-hand 134). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P19 order arrived P23). Given the sustained high volume, we continue to use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P16-P23) to capture the elevated mean and variance accurately without dilution from older, lower data.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P23): Avg ~217 units, nearly double historical baseline, with high volatility (std ~30+).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25. The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 (mean ~220 units) has persisted for 9 periods, significantly exceeding the prior baseline (~116 units). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by Period 24 arrival). With On-hand (100) + In-transit (812) = 912, the inventory position covers only about 4 periods of demand, falling short of the required (L+1)=5 periods of coverage (~1100 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=9 to strictly utilize data from the current high-demand regime (P16-P24), ensuring the order quantity reflects the new consumption rate and volatility without dilution from older, lower data.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P24): Average demand holds at ~220 units, approximately double the historical baseline, with significant volatility (range 177-254).

Period 26. The high-demand regime (started Period 16) remains active. Demand in P25 (171) was lower than recent peaks but within the regime's volatile range (171-254). The average over this 10-period regime (P16-P25) is approx 215 units per period. All shipments are arriving exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25). Pipeline is intact (890 units matches sum of orders P22-P25). I am updating the forecast parameters to use N=10 (covering the full high-demand regime P16-P25) to ensure base stock covers the higher mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (P16-P25): Avg demand ~215 units, distinct from historical baseline, with significant volatility (range 171-254).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (95) signals a hard crash from the 'surge' regime (avg ~215), likely reverting to the historical baseline (~116). Current inventory position (1043 units) covers ~10 periods of this lower demand, creating a significant overstock risk. Parameters obey the signal to cut orders: mu_hat is set explicitly to 525 (forecast 105 * 5 periods) to reflect the drop, while sigma_hat uses recent history to capture the volatility of the transition.

Carry-over insight: Lead time steady at 4 periods. Major regime shift P26: Demand crashed to 95, ending the P16-P25 surge (avg ~215) and likely reverting to pre-surge baseline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand (84) confirms the regime crash observed in Period 26 (95). The high-demand surge (P16-P25) is definitively over, with current levels (avg ~90) resembling the dip seen in Periods 4-7. Using 'explicit' parameters derived strictly from the new 2-period regime avoids polluting the forecast with the high demand from Period 25. With a total pipeline of 959 units (402 on-hand + 557 in-transit) against a 5-period expected demand of ~450, we are massively overstocked. These parameters will effectively halt ordering to burn down excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed (P26-P27 avg ~90), ending the P16-P25 surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: Demand has stabilized in a lower post-surge regime (P26-P28 avg ~100 units), significantly down from the peak (~215). However, we are carrying heavy inventory (441 on-hand + 397 in-transit = 838 total). With a lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5), expected demand is only ~500 units. We are massively overstocked. I am setting parameters to reflect the recent low demand (N=3) to force the order quantity to zero and burn down excess inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand curve stabilizes: P26-P28 avg ~100 units, indicating a return to the early-game baseline (P1-P5 avg ~114) rather than a complete crash.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-198.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline following the crash in Period 26. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is ~99.5 units, significantly below the previous surge levels. We currently hold 590 units on-hand plus 150 in-transit, which covers nearly 7.5 periods of demand at the current rate (far exceeding the lead time coverage of 5 periods). To prevent further overstocking and reduce holding costs, I am setting forecasting parameters to strictly use the last 4 periods (N=4), effectively ignoring the prior high-demand data. This will lower the target base stock and ensure no new orders are placed until inventory normalizes.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed: Demand clearly successfully reverted to pre-surge baseline (P26-P29 avg ~100 vs historical P1-P5 avg ~114), confirming the P16-P25 high-demand era is over.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized at a lower baseline (avg ~103 for last 5 periods). High inventory (623 units) necessitates zero orders. Transitioning parameters to 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu and sigma to exclude the previous surge data and align base stock with the current lower, stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed: Demand clearly successfully reverted to pre-surge baseline (P26-P30 avg ~103 vs historical P1-P5 avg ~114). P30 demand (117) fits this baseline perfectly.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has fully stabilized in the post-crash regime (period 26 onward), with the last 6 periods averaging ~104 units and exhibiting lower volatility than the prior surge. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (order of 0 in P27 arrived as 0 in P31). Inventory (516) has finally burned down to near the base stock level required for 5 periods of demand (~520-540 units), so ordering should resume shortly. We use recent_N=6 for both demand and volatility to isolate this stable regime and exclude the high-variance surge data.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 33. The low-demand regime established in Period 26 is now highly stable. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged ~105 units with low volatility (std dev ~13), consistent with the game's initial baseline. High inventory levels (peak 740 in P30) have successfully bled down to 404 due to zero ordering in P27-P31. We face a supply gap: P33-P35 arrivals will be zero. Current inventory (404) plus the small P32 order (29) = 433 total pipeline, which barely covers the next ~4 periods of demand (4 * 105 = 420). To avoid stockouts in P37/P38, we must resume normal replenishment. We select 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu and sigma to strictly target the stable post-surge behavior and exclude the legacy surge statistics.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge stability confirmed: P26-P32 demand averages ~105 units. Inventory rightsizing evident (740->404); replenishment cycle must resume to bridge upcoming zero-arrival periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory rightsizing is successfully complete (302 units on hand vs 740 peak). We face a calculated inventory dip in P36/P37 (due to necessary zero-order periods P27-P31), but coverage remains sufficient if demand holds near the current average. Demand from P26-P33 is stable at ~104.5 units, effectively reverting to the pre-surge baseline. Using recent_N=8 captures this entire post-surge stability period to set accurate replenishment targets for P38 impact.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 35. Demand has stabilized into a consistent low regime following the P26 crash. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 102 units, with P34 (80 units) showing typical volatility within this range. The inventory glut from the demand crash has successfully burned down (from 740 units in P30 to 222 units now), and ordering has resumed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 for both mean and volatility to base the forecast entirely on this stable post-surge period, disregarding the high-demand outlier data from before Period 26. Lead time remains stable at default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Regime stability sustained (P26-P34): Average demand ~102 units, consistent with pre-surge history. Inventory rightsizing successful (740 -> 222); normal replenishment cycle fully active.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 observation confirms the post-surge stable regime is firmly established (P26-P35). Average demand over the last 10 periods is ~104 units, closely matching the early game baseline (P1-P5 avg ~114). The extreme volatility of the surge (P16-P25) has dissipated. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 100 and a small arrival due (29 units ordered P32), total availability (~129) is close to expected demand (~104), making accurate replenishment critical. I am using recent_N=10 to utilize the full post-crash history for a robust forecast of this stable baseline.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed (P26-P35): Average demand ~104 units, fully reverted to pre-surge baseline. Volatility is moderate (range 80-122).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: Demand continues to be stable in the post-surge regime. The last 10 periods (P27-P36) average 103.4 units, consistent with the pre-surge baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). 

Inventory status: On-hand is low (38 units), but the restocking cycle is active. The order placed in Period 33 (117 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 37 (L=4), providing total availability of ~155 units against an expected demand of ~103, avoiding stockout. 

Parameters: We continue to use 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current stable regime (avg ~103) while excluding the distant high-volatility surge data. L stays at 'default' (4) as performance is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed (P26-P36): Demand remains stable around ~103 units/period, with standard volatility. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 Analysis: The demand regime remains stable and low (reverted baseline) following the P16-P25 surge. The most recent demand observation in Period 37 was shockingly low (55 units), dragging the post-surge average (P26-P37) down to ~99 units, compared to the historical P1-P5 baseline of ~114. This 55 could be an outlier or signal further cooling, but for now, we treat the regime as stable around ~100 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by P33 order arriving in P37). On-hand inventory is 100, and pipeline is substantial (391 units in-transit). Given the stability, we continue using 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the current baseline (approx 100 units) without reacting over-sensitively to the single low point of 55. We select N=12 to span the entire post-surge period (P26-P37) for a robust estimate.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed (P26-P37): Average demand ~99 units, slightly below original baseline, punctuated by a low outlier in P37 (55 units).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The 'Regular' demand regime (post-surge) continues to hold from Period 26 through Period 38, with an average demand of ~101 units. Periods 37 (low 55) and 38 (high 132) showed significant volatility but averaged out to ~93.5, close to the baseline, suggesting random noise rather than a trend shift. Current Inventory Position (66 on-hand + 333 in-transit = 399) is low relative to the 5-period demand coverage required (~500+ safety stock). To ensure sufficient stock coverage and account for the recent volatility, I am using the full post-surge history (N=13) for both mean and volatility estimation.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability persists (P26-P38): Avg demand ~101 units. Recent volatility (P37: 55, P38: 132) widens the range, but the central tendency remains aligned with the 'Regular' historical baseline (~100-105).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 analysis: The demand regime remains stable in the post-surge 'Regular' baseline. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 39 (the current stable era) is approximately 100 units (mean=99.6), heavily realigning with the early game history (P1-P5 avg ~114). Volatility has been noticeable recently (P37: 55, P38: 132, P39: 81), but the central tendency is clearly around 100. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by P35 order arriving in P39). Inventory is lean (55 units) but functional, with 399 units in transit covering future demand roughly 4 periods out. I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=14 (periods 26-39) to capture the full post-surge stability while smoothing out the recent period-to-period noise.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability persists (P26-P39): Long-term post-surge average is ~100 units, confirming a return to 'Regular' baseline. Recent volatility (low 55, high 132) is noise around this stable mean.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 41. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P36 order arrived P40). Demand continues to align with the post-surge baseline (avg ~101 since P26), though recent periods show high noise (P37=55 vs P40=136). Current on-hand inventory is low (48), and the pipeline has a dip in expected arrivals for P42 (40 units) due to the P38 reaction to low demand. To mitigate stockout risk in P42/P43 while avoiding overstocking, we use N=15 for demand parameters. This window (P26-P40) captures the full stable post-surge regime, smoothing the recent noise while respecting the true underlying variance.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed (P26-P40): Average demand ~101 units, adhering to historical baseline, but volatility remains high (recent range 55-136).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Post-surge regime mean remains stable (~104), but short-term volatility has increased significantly (P37-P41 variance), leading to a stockout in P41. Using recent_N=16 for mu_hat smoothes the mean calculation over the stable regime, while recent_N=5 for sigma_hat reacts to the immediate volatility spike to boost safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Volatility spike confirmed: Recent demand (P37-P41 range 55-142) shows high variance (std~38) despite stable long-term mean (~104), causing stockout in P41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 43. Demand mean remains stable near the historical baseline (P26-P42 avg ~103), but recent volatility (P37-P42) is high (range 55-142) and oscillating, resulting in stockouts in P41 and P42. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the stockouts and high variance, I am splitting the estimation windows: using a longer history (N=17, covering the full post-surge regime) for mu_hat to maintain a stable replenishment target, while using a short window (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility spike and boost safety stock. Pipeline matches expected orders exactly.

Carry-over insight: Volatility persistence confirmed (P37-P42): Demand swings widely (55-142, std~36) around a stable mean (~104), contrasting with the calmer P26-P36 period. This variance has caused consecutive stockouts.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. The product is in a high-volatility regime (P38-P43 range: 79-142), causing instability. We stocked out in P41 and P42 (lost sales), and ended P43 with critical inventory (14 units). The pipeline coverage (464 units) is likely insufficient for the current volatility (demand avg ~115, std ~30+ over last 6 periods). Incoming shipment for P44 is only 84 units, making another stockout highly probable given on-hand is 14. To recover service levels and rebuild safety stock against this nervousness, I am updating parameters to strictly reflect the last 6 periods of high variance and elevated mean.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45/50. Pipeline (561 units) covers ~5.5 periods of avg demand (102.5), fully covering the lead time window. However, high volatility (std dev ~30, range 55-142) requires maintaining safety stock to prevent stockouts like P41/P42. Using recent_N=10 captures the full variance of the current regime while recognizing the stable mean, likely generating a small trimming order to secure Period 49 service levels.

Carry-over insight: Volatility persistence confirmed (P37-P44): Demand continues to swing widely (range 55-142, std ~30) around a stable mean (~102), requiring higher safety stock buffers than the stable mean suggests.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 Analysis: The post-surge regime (P26-P45) remains stable with a mean demand of ~100 units/period, closely matching the early-game baseline. However, significant period-to-period volatility persists (recent range 65-142, std ~31), requiring a safety stock buffer. Lead times consistently resolve at the promised 4 periods. Current inventory position (81 on-hand + 401 in-transit = 482) is slightly below the 5-period target (~500+safety), warranting a replenishment order. Strategy: Use 'recent_N' (N=20) for mu_hat to anchor the forecast to the stable long-term mean (~100) while filtering noise. Use 'recent_N' (N=10) for sigma_hat to sensitively capture the higher recent volatility (P36-P45) compared to the calmer P26-P35 period.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed (P26-P45): Mean demand stays pinned at ~100 units (consistent with 'Regular' baseline), but volatility remains high (std ~31 in last 10 periods), necessitating higher safety stock than the mean implies.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: The market regime remains stable in the post-surge 'Regular' baseline (approx. 100 units/period) but continues to exhibit high volatility (std dev ~31 over the last 10 periods, ~28 over last 20 periods). The average demand from P26-P46 is ~101 units. Lead time is consistently delivering at 4 periods without delay. Since the volatility remains a persistent feature of this regime (ranging 55-142 recently), we continue using 'recent_N' with N=10 for variance estimation to capture this risk profile accurately, while using N=20 for the mean to anchor to the stable long-term baseline. This approach maintains sufficient safety stock to buffer against swings like P41/P42.

Carry-over insight: Regime stability confirmed (P26-P46): Mean demand anchors firmly at ~101 units ('Regular' baseline), but volatility is persistent (std ~31), requiring robust safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48/50. Demand regime (P26-P47) remains fundamentally stable with a mean around ~105 units, aligning with the historical 'Regular' baseline. However, the last 10 periods (P38-P47) exhibit significant volatility (range 65-142, std dev ~29-30) causing recent stockout risks. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. We select 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu and sigma to capture this recent high-variance cluster, ensuring the safety stock buffer reflects the current instability rather than the calmer long-term average. Current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 495; with a 5-period risk horizon (L+1), the target base stock will likely trigger a top-up order to cover the variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: High volatility persists in post-surge regime (P37-P47), with demand ranging 55-142 and std dev ~30, despite stable mean ~105.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. The post-surge regime (Period 26+) continues to show high volatility around a stable mean of ~100 units. Demand in Period 48 dropped to 67 units, contributing to a slight inventory build-up (total coverage ~515 units vs expected demand of ~500 for L+1=5 periods). However, recent history (P41: 142, P46: 126) demonstrates that demand can spike rapidly. We maintain N=10 for parameters to average over this volatility (mean ~99, std ~30) rather than reacting to the single low data point of P48, ensuring we remain protected against the upper end of the variance (140+). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge volatility remains the dominant feature (P39-P48 range: 65-142, std ~30), while the mean remains stable near ~100 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 50. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P46-P49). Demand regime has been stable since P26, averaging ~102 units/period, but exhibits significant volatility (range 55-142, std ~30). I am selecting a 20-period lookback window for demand parameters (mu and sigma) to robustly capture this stable post-surge baseline while accounting for the high persistent variance. The on-hand inventory (97) plus pipeline (344) must cover the next 5 periods of demand plus safety stock.
