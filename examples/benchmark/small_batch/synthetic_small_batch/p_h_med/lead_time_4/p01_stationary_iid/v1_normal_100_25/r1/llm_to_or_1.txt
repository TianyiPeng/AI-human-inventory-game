Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Initializing parameters using the provided 5-period historical demand data. With no observed lead times yet, defaulting to the promised lead time of 4 periods. Setting demand forecast window (N) to 5 to match the available history length. Mean demand is approx 90 units/period. The objective is to build base stock to cover demand over the review period plus lead time (5 periods total).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 2. We are in the early phase with Observed Demand P1=108, which is slightly higher than the historical average (~90) derived from provided samples. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, no arrivals have occurred yet (expected starting Period 5 or 6). Pipeline inventory (118) is insufficient to cover the review period plus lead time (5 periods total), so a significant replenishment order is expected. We utilize default parameters to allow the system to calculate base stock using the full available demand history (historical samples + current observations) to manage uncertainty and fill the pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Operating in Period 3. Observed demands (108, 124) are trending higher than the provided historical samples (avg ~90). With a high critical ratio (4:1 profit to holding) and a 4-period lead time, the current pipeline of 239 units is critically low against the forecasted 5-period demand (approx 580 units). Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) to rapidly adapt to the higher realized demand (averaging 116). Setting sigma_hat explicitly to 50.0 to ensure a robust safety buffer, as the calculated variance from only two data points is unreliable. No lead time deviations observed yet; arrivals expected starting Period 5.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, order placed in Period 1 (Decision Phase) arrives in Period 5 (Arrival Phase) and will be visible in 'Period 5 conclude'. Thus, 0 arrivals so far is expected and consistent with L=4. We have faced stockouts due to the pipeline fill delay. Observed demand in Game History (108, 124, 85) averages ~106, which is higher than the provided historical samples (avg ~90). I am using recent_N=3 to align the forecast with the higher realized demand while retaining the default lead time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 5. No arrivals observed yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (Order P1 arrives P5, visible in P6 start). Demand has shown variance (High: 116 avg first 2 periods, Low: 82 avg last 2 periods), so using the full observed history (N=4) for estimation balances these fluctuations. Pipeline inventory (529) is substantial, consistent with all past orders remaining in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Confirmation received that Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, establishing an actual lead time of 4 periods (matches promised). Pipeline of 417 units exactly matches open orders from Periods 2-5, indicating no lost orders. Actual demand over the last 5 periods (avg ~99.2) is slightly higher than the initial historical samples provided. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to align with the actual realized demand mean (~99) and volatility (~18) observed in the game history. Lead time is set to default (promised) as it matches the observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 conclude confirms that the order placed in Period 2 arrived exactly on time, establishing a consistent Lead Time of 4 periods (Promised=4, Actual=4). No lost orders detected; In-transit inventory (391) exactly matches pending orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6. Demand appears stationary with a mean approximately 99 units based on total history.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 8. Lead time is robustly confirmed at 4 periods, with the Period 3 order arriving on time in Period 7. Demand remains volatile with no distinct trend; Period 7 demand (122) was a high outlier compared to Periods 3-6. Given the high Critical Ratio (0.8) and a 5-period risk horizon (L+1), we use the full available game history (N=7) for demand forecasts (mu_hat, sigma_hat) to capture the true variance and ensure sufficient safety stock against spikes like those seen in P2 and P7.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Lead time is robustly confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals from P1-P4 orders arriving in P5-P8. Demand has been volatile but averages ~105 over the last 8 periods, with a recent uptick in P7-P8 (122, 121). I am switching to 'recent_N=8' for mu and sigma to rely exclusively on the realized game history rather than pre-game priors, ensuring the forecast reflects the actual observed mean (~105) and volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to align with the observed 4-period reality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Inventory is stocked out (0 units) with 453 in-transit. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P5 order arrived P9). Demand has shifted significantly higher in the last 3 periods (P7-P9 avg: 129.3) compared to prior history (avg prior P7: ~90), culminating in a stockout in P9. Given the high profit ratio (0.8), preventing lost sales is critical. I am switching 'mu_hat' to 'recent_N' with N=3 to rapidly adapt to this high-demand regime (~129 units/period). 'sigma_hat' uses N=5 to capture the volatility of this new level (including the 145 spike). This will generate a larger order to refill the pipeline and stabilize valid service levels for P14+.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Periods 7-9: avg increased to ~129 (prev avg ~90), with P9 spike to 145.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 decision. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (most recent: Period 6 order arrived in Period 10). Demand remains in a higher regime (Periods 7-10 avg ~126 vs Periods 1-6 avg ~99), causing stockouts in Periods 9 and 10. The arrival of 94 units this period is likely insufficient to cover demand (~126). I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to target this elevated mean. I am keeping sigma_hat at 'default' (~20) rather than recent (~13) because the long-term volatility is higher, providing a larger safety buffer to help recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sustained Periods 7-10: avg ~126 (vs pre-P7 ~99). Lead time stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 7 order arrived in Period 11 as expected). Demand in Period 11 dropped to 89, breaking the high-demand streak of Periods 7-10 (avg ~126). However, observing stockouts in Periods 9 and 10, and given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (0.8), we must avoid underreacting to potential volatility. We select recent_N=5 for demand parameters to average the high-demand block with the recent drop (~118 avg) and capture the increased variance, ensuring safety stock remains robust against further spikes. In-transit inventory (574 units) matches the sum of outstanding orders (P8-P11), confirming no lost shipments.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (chips(Regular)). Context: Profit $4, Holding $1 (Critical Ratio 0.8). Existing inventory is 34 units, with 494 in transit. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by Period 12 conclude (Order P8 arrived P12). Demand Analysis: We observed a high demand regime from P7-P10 (avg ~126), followed by a dip in P11 (89) and P12 (102). The average over the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is (122+121+145+115+89+102)/6 \u2248 115.7. The dip in P11-P12 suggests the 'spike' might be cooling, but 115 is still higher than the early game average (~99). Given the volatility (std dev for P7-P12 is approx 19.3), sticking to a recent window captures the current level better than the global average. We will use 'recent_N=6' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P6 demand shift while acknowledging the slight recent cooling. L remains at the observed 4 (using recent_N).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Lead time validation: Order from P9 arrived in P13 (4 periods). Order from P8 arrived in P12 (4 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. No lost orders detected recently. Demand analysis: Demand has shown significant volatility. Recent samples (P9-P13) are: 145, 115, 89, 102, 73. The recent average (approx 104.8) is lower than the peak period of P7-P9, but heavily skewed by the high P9. The most recent observation (P13=73) is a significant dip, closer to pre-P7 levels. Given the volatility (std dev of last 5 is ~28.5), we need to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs. The regime shift identified around P7 seems to be stabilizing or reverting slightly. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this mixed regime (high peak at P9, low dip at P13) without overreacting to just the latest low point, ensuring we cover the potential for another spike like P9. Service level is set high by the critical ratio ($4/($4+$1)=0.8), so covering the variance is key.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility high in Periods 9-13 (range 73-145), suggesting unpredictable swings rather than a stable high plateau.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (observed consistently for confirmed orders). Demand shows a significant downward trend in the last few periods (P13=73, P14=63) compared to the P7-P10 peak. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4, avg ~82) to respond to this cooling demand while remaining slightly conservative. For sigma_hat, I am using a longer window (recent_N=10) to maintain a robust safety stock buffer given the historical volatility. Current total inventory (513 units) is substantial relative to the dropping demand, so the system may pause ordering to burn off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend: P13-P14 avg 68, significantly lower than P7-P10 peak avg (~126).

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 demand spiked to 142, abruptly ending the 'cooling trend' observed in Periods 13-14 (avg 68). This confirms a high-volatility regime (range 63-145) rather than a stable downward shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (100% adherence). Given the high cost of lost sales vs holding (4:1) and the recent undersized pipeline orders (0, 34, 87) due to the dip, we switch to a longer N=10 window for forecast parameters. This captures the full volatility range and raises the target stock level (avg ~107) to buffer against spikes like P15.

Carry-over insight: Volatility dominant: P15 spike (142) invalidates cooling trend; demand erratic between 63-145 (avg ~107) requiring higher safety buffers.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand is erratic (recent range 63-142), requiring a robust safety stock. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat (approx 108) smoothens the extreme swings while respecting the generally higher regime (post-P7). Using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat captures the specific high volatility of the last few periods to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 observation confirms extreme volatility with a new demand high in P17 (148). The cooling trend observed in P13-14 (avg ~68) has been decisively invalidated by P15-P17 (avg ~133). A supply gap is imminent in P19 (0 units arriving), making stockouts likely if demand persists at these levels. To recover pipeline inventory aggressively and hedge against the high stockout cost ($4 margin), we switch to a highly responsive forecast: mu_hat uses N=3 (capturing the recent high mean ~133) and sigma_hat uses N=5 (capturing the full volatility swing from 63 to 148). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Volatility extreme. Record demand P17 (148) confirms high-demand regime returned. P13-14 dip was temporary noise. Last 3 periods avg ~133, range 108-148.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by P14 order arriving in P18). Current on-hand is low (6 units) with a healthy pipeline (509 units). However, recent demand remains elevated and volatile (average ~127 over last 4 periods: P15:142, P16:108, P17:148, P18:109). The drop in Period 18 to 109 aligns with recent volatility rather than a sustained decrease. The previous regime assessment (P15-17 avg ~133) holds mostly true, skewing higher than the long-term average. Given the high stockout cost relative to holding (0.8 critical ratio) and recent stockouts in P9-10 and near-stockout now, I will maintain parameters that reflect this recent high-demand regime (last 4-5 periods) to prevent service failure while the in-transit inventory arrives. I'll use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the erratic but high behavior (142, 108, 148, 109), and default for lead-time since it's stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant feature (P15-18 avg ~127, range 108-148), confirming the departure from the P13-14 cooling period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P19 arrival of 0 matches P15 order of 0). The P19 stockout (on-hand dropped to 0, 56 lost sales) was caused directly by the reaction to the false 'cooling trend' in P13-14, which led to a zero order in P15. Demand in P19 (62) dropped sharply again, mirroring the dip in P13-14, while periods P15-P18 were high (avg ~127). This confirms a pattern of extreme unpredictable volatility (range 62-148) rather than sustained regimes. 

We must not overreact to the low demand in P19 as we did in P15. The pipeline is now recovering with robust orders from P16-P19 (total in-transit 668). To prevent future caps from throttling necessary recovery orders during high-demand swings, I am maintaining 'recent_N' = 5 for both mu and sigma. This captures the full volatility of the last cycle (peaks of ~148 and troughs of ~62), ensuing the safety stock buffer accounts for the max-demand scenarios despite the low average in P19.

Carry-over insight: Volatility pattern confirmed: Demand oscillates violently between ~60 (P13-14, P19) and ~140+ (P9, P15, P17). The P19 stockout validates that 'cooling' trends are likely noise; parameters must remain defensive against the upper range (148) regardless of single-period drops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand (102) stabilizes near the recent average, but the broader window (P15-20) shows extreme volatility ranging from 62 to 148 (avg ~112, sigma ~31). Lead time consistency (4 periods) allows using default L. Given current pipeline (566) vs target, and the high cost of stockouts (ratio 4:1), we use a 6-period window (recent_N=6) for both mean and volatility. This window captures the high peaks (148, 142) and the deep troughs (62, 63), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the significant variance while targeting the robust average of ~112.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: High volatility regime confirmed sustained (P15-20: mean ~112, range 62-148, sigma ~31). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 starts with On-hand 103 and Pipeline 408 (Total 511). Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21). Demand history shows high volatility (range 62-148 over last 7 periods), with a recent average of ~111 (P15-P21). The P19 stockout highlighted the risk of 'cooling' periods (low orders) followed by volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4:$1), we prioritize service level. We select N=7 for estimators (Periods 15-21) to capture this high-mean, high-variance regime (Mean ~111, vs longer-term ~102) and drive a higher base stock target to buffer against spikes like P17 (148).

Carry-over insight: Refined volatility metric: Periods 15-21 establish a 'volatile high-mean' baseline (Avg ~111, Sigma ~28), replacing the lower-demand expectations of the P13-14 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $225.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized near 105, but the regime starting P15 contains significant volatility (62-148). We maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (avg ~110, std ~27) to robustly cover both the stable center and the potential for large variance seen earlier in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Volatility stabilization: P20-P22 demand remarkably stable (102, 107, 105) compared to P15-P19 swings. Regime mean remains ~110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 currently shows a stable demand regime from P20-P23 (Avg ~105, very low variance). However, Periods 15-19 exhibited extreme volatility (range 62-148). Given the high critical ratio (0.8), optimizing solely for the recent stable window (N=4) risks under-stocking if a volatility spike returns. Therefore, I am using N=9 (Periods 15-23) for demand parameters. This incorporates the stable P20-P23 data while keeping the variance from P15-P19 in the sigma calculation to maintain an adequate safety buffer. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods; no lost orders detected in pipeline (248 units in-transit match expected pending arrivals).

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed P20-P23 (avg ~105, range 102-107), significantly tighter than P15-P19. Volatility risk remains latent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shown remarkable stability in Periods 20-24 (avg 105, range 102-107), departing from the extreme volatility of Periods 15-19. However, because the critical ratio is high (0.8), stripping away safety stock by using a short window (N=5) is dangerous if volatility returns. We choose N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to blend the recent stable mean (~109 over 10 periods) with the volatility variance of P15-P19, ensuring the system maintains a buffer against sudden spikes like the 148 seen in P17. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization regime extended P20-P24: Demand tightly clustered (mean 105, sigma ~2) for 5 periods, contrasting with prior volatility. Monitoring for sudden reversion to high-variance behavior.

=== Period 25 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $500.00, Daily Holding Cost: $70.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: We observe a demand spike to 125 in Period 25, breaking the tight 'stabilization' cluster (mean ~105, range 102-107) seen in Periods 20-24. This suggests the low-volatility regime was temporary, and demand may be reverting to the erratic behavior observed in Periods 15-19 (range 62-148). The pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 466 units. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Using parameters from the calm P20-24 window would underestimate risk (sigma ~2 vs sigma ~30 earlier). Therefore, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mean and sigma. This window (Periods 16-25) captures the recent stability BUT also includes the high-volatility events (P17 demand 148, P19 demand 62), ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the true latent risk of the system. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization broken P25: Demand jumped to 125 (+20% vs P20-24 avg), suggesting return to higher volatility seen in P15-19. Variance metrics must now include older high-volatility samples (N=10) to prevent stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 review. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (all shipments accounted for). The demand pattern has confirmed a return to erratic volatility: Period 26 dropped to 80 immediately following Period 25's spike to 125, shattering the stability observed in P20-P24. This oscillation (80-125) combined with earlier extremes (62 in P19, 148 in P17) dictates a defensive strategy. I am maintaining N=10 for both mu and sigma to capture this full high-variance window (P17-P26), preventing the system from understocking during potential peaks like P17. Pipeline inventory (410 units) matches outstanding orders exactly.

Carry-over insight: Erratic volatility confirmed: P26 demand drop to 80 (vs P25's 125) validates the return of large swings. Strategies must use N=10 to encompass the full risk range (62-148) rather than reacting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand (115) rebounded significantly from the Period 26 drop (80), confirming that the volatility initially observed in Period 15 is the persistent regime, and the stability of Periods 20-24 was merely a temporary lull. Short-term windows (N=5 or N=10) risk underestimating variance by overweighting the recent low outliers (62, 80). Therefore, I am expanding the observation window to N=13 (Periods 15-27) to encompass the entire high-volatility epoch. This captures the true risk profile, including earlier peaks of 142 and 148, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the actual potential for demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (starting P15) confirmed as dominant baseline after P27 data; N=13 is required to capture the full risk profile (Mean ~109, Peaks ~148) and avoid undersizing safety stock due to recent low-demand noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 demand (132) reinforces the high-volatility regime identified since Period 15, invalidating the 'stable' lull of Periods 20-24. Demand in the last 4 periods (125, 80, 115, 132) exhibits large swings similar to Periods 15-19. With ending inventory at a critical level (41 units) and demand approaching earlier peaks, we must utilize a long historical window (N=14, covering P15-P28) to capture the full mean (~110) and variance. Relying on shorter windows would underestimate risk given the alternating high/low pattern. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P28) confirmed dominant; the stability of P20-24 was temporary. Recent P28 demand (132) aligns with earlier peaks. N=14 is strictly required to capture the full oscillating range (62-148) and maintain adequate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 30. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand data since Period 15 confirms a 'High Volatility' regime, characterized by large, unpredictable oscillations (range 62-148) rather than a stable mean. The stabilization observed in P20-24 was transient, as P25-29 has returned to erratic behavior (swings from 80 to 132). Period 29 demand (98) represents a dip in this ongoing zigzag pattern. To maintain a high service level ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), we must size the safety stock based on the full volatility of this regime. Therefore, we select N=15 (covering P15-P29) to ensure the variance calculation includes the extreme peaks (148) and valleys (62) of the current market behavior.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P29) confirmed dominant; erratic swings continue. N=15 is required to capture the full risk profile (Mean ~110, Peaks ~148) and maintain adequate safety stock against deep oscillations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 31. Demand in P30 (87) and P29 (98) represents the lower bound of the established high-volatility oscillation, similar to dips observed in P19 (62) and P26 (80). However, upside risk remains high (P28 was 132, P25 was 125, P17 was 148). The Lead Time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent the OR backend from interpreting the recent dip as a stable cooling trend and under-ordering, we must maintain a long memory window (N=16) that includes the regime start at P15 (142) and the peak at P17 (148). This preserves a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat to buffer against the inevitable up-swing.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P30) confirmed dominant; recent low demand (P29-30) is consistent with established oscillatory noise. N=16 is strictly required to maintain visibility of regime peaks (P15=142, P17=148) and ensure adequate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 ended in a stockout (Demand 145 > On-Hand 136), confirming that the recent lower demand in Periods 29-30 (98, 87) was merely downward volatility within a high-variance regime, not a cooling trend. The demand distribution continues to oscillate violently between ~60 and ~148. To prevent future stockouts, we must ensure the parameters account for the full history of this erratic behavior starting from Period 15. I am setting N=17 for both mean and volatility to include the entire high-volatility block (Period 15-31). This forces the sigma calculation to see the peaks (142, 148, 145) alongside the valleys, ensuring adequate safety stock buffering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Stockout at Period 31 (demand 145) confirms high-volatility regime (P15-present) is dominant; relatively low demand in P29-30 was deceptive noise. N must extend to 17 to encompass the full risk profile (range 62-148) and prevent under-ordering during lulls.

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 33. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The high-volatility regime (starting Period 15) continues to dominate, with demand oscillating between ~60 and ~148. P31 saw a stockout due to a demand spike (145), and P32 (111) remains above the average of the quieter periods. Current pipeline coverage (On-hand 23 + In-transit 462 = 485) provides only ~97 units/period for the next 5 periods, which is below the regime average (~110) and dangerously below peak risks. To prevent stockouts, we must increase the target base stock. We select N=18 for both mean and sigma to encompass the entire volatile history since P15 (including the P15 peak of 142), ensuring the backend calculates a robust safety stock that accounts for the full range of observed variance.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P33) remains dominant; recent demand P31 (145) and P32 (111) reinforces the risk of peaks ~148. Pipeline coverage is currently critical (avg ~97 units/period vs demand mean ~110). N=18 is strictly required to retain the full volatility history starting at P15 and prevent under-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-volatility regime (active since Period 15) persists. Although demand in P32 (111) and P33 (105) was close to the long-term average, the severe stockout in P31 (demand 145) confirms that peak risks remain roughly every 3-4 periods. Current pipeline coverage is tight. To accurately model this sustained volatility and prevent under-ordering during temporary lulls, we utilize the full regime history (P15-P33) by setting N=19. This captures the full risk range (62-148) for robust safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P33) confirmed dominant; P31 stockout reinforces that 'cooling' trends (P32-33) are likely noise. N=19 is strictly required to encompass the full volatility history (starting P15) and maintain adequate safety stock.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 decision. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive successful arrivals P30-34). The high-volatility demand regime starting at Period 15 remains the dominant market characteristic. While P32-34 (avg ~104) show moderation, the P31 spike (145) and historical peaks (P15=142, P17=148) confirm that volatility is latent. To address the risk of stockouts (like P31) without overreacting to short-term noise, we use N=20. This window (P15-P34) captures the full history of the current regime, ensuring the standard deviation reflects the true risk range (62-148) and the mean (~109) is robust.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P34) confirmed dominant; recent cooling (P32-34) is consistent with regime noise. N=20 is verified as the optimal window to capture the full risk profile (Mean ~109, Max 148, Min 62) and protect against sudden demand spikes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: The 'High Volatility Regime' (starting P15) continues. Recent demand in P32-P35 (avg ~105) mirrors the temporary stabilization seen in P21-P24, which was followed by erratic swings. To prevent safety stock erosion during this 'calm' phase, we must extend the lookback window to N=21 (capturing P15-P35). This ensures the model retains memory of the major peaks (P15=142, P17=148, P31=145) and the full variance profile to buffer against the likely return of instability. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods; pipeline inventory (455 units) matches expected orders exactly.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization pattern recurring: P32-P35 demand (avg ~105) aligns closely with the temporary calm of P21-P24. This confirms recent stability is likely noise within the dominant high-volatility regime (P15-present). N=21 is now required to span the full volatile history and maintain peak-protection safety stock.

Short-term stabilizing trends in this game have repeatedly been noise before a reversion to high variance. To ensure the safety stock handles potential spikes back to ~148 (seen in P17 and near-miss P31), I extended the observation window to N=22. This captures the entire volatility history from P15 through P36. The supply chain is healthy: lead time is stable at 4 periods, and the in-transit quantity (411) perfectly matches the open orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P36) reinforced by P36 uptick (123); stabilization P33-35 proven temporary. N=22 is strictly required to encompass the full risk profile (Mean ~110, Max 148) and prevent under-ordering.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 38 decision. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods (P37 conclude: arrived 109, ordered P33 -> 4 periods). Demand in Period 37 dropped to 83, which is a low-end oscillation within the established high-volatility regime (P15-present). The regime is defined by violent swings between ~60 and ~148. To prevent the recent low demand (P37) from artificially dragging down the forecast and causing stockouts during the next peak, we must maintain a long observation window. Following the established strategy, we extend N to 23 to capture the entire volatility history starting at Period 15, ensuring the safety stock calculation includes the critical peaks at P15 (142) and P17 (148). Total pipeline (506) is slightly below the robust safety target, warranting a replenishment.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P38) confirmed dominant; P37 (83) represents a low-bound oscillation. N=23 is strictly required to capture the full regime history (starting P15) and prevent under-ordering by retaining early peaks (P15, P17) in the dataset.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand (110) aligns perfectly with the regime average (approx. 110), confirming the ongoing high-volatility pattern established since Period 15. While there are short-term fluctuations (e.g., P37 drop to 83, P36 rise to 123), the overall risk profile remains defined by unpredictable swings between ~60 and ~148. To maximize profit with a critical ratio of 0.8, we must maintain a safety buffer that accounts for the upper tail risks (P15=142, P17=148, P31=145). Reducing the observation window would discard these critical early peaks and expose the system to stockouts during future spikes. Therefore, I am extending N to 24 to capture the entire history of this regime (Periods 15-38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: High-volatility regime (P15-P38) continues; P38 demand (110) is typical. N=24 is strictly required to encompass the full risk profile (including P15/P17 peaks) and maintain robust safety stock against recurrent spikes ~148.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 observation. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (Order P35 arrived P39 as promised). Demand P39 (93) aligns with the established high-volatility regime (P15-present), characterized by erratic swings between ~60 and ~148. While the regime has persisted for 25 periods, the parameter protocol caps N at 20. Using N=20 encompasses data from P20 to P39, which includes the stable block (P20-25) but crucially captures the high volatility of P26-39 (including the P31 spike to 145). This window provides a sufficiently high variance estimate to maintain robust safety stock for upper-range risks (~145) without relying on the oldest data (P15-19). Current pipeline (490 units) is lean compared to demand peaks, so defensive parameters are necessary.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P39) confirmed dominant; P39 demand (93) is typical baseline noise. N=20 (protocol max) effectively captures the relevant risk profile, including the recent P31 spike (145), ensuring ongoing protection against sudden regime peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand (P40=91) continues a short-term cooling trend (P37-P40 avg ~94), but the dominant regime remains high-volatility (since P15). Past patterns show lulls often precede sharp spikes (e.g., P29-30 preceding P31=145). We maintain N=20 to ensure the P31 stockout-causing spike (145) and the volatility of P25-28 remain in the sample window. This prevents the system from under-ordering due to the recent low-demand noise and maintains a safety stock capable of handling regime peaks. Lead time is verified stable at 4 periods; no lost orders detected.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P40) persists; recent lull P37-P40 (avg ~94) resembles prior noise blocks (e.g., P29-30) that preceded spikes. N=20 remains the effective horizon to capture relevant variance (including P31=145) without over-reacting to short-term dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 demand dropped to 64, hitting the lower bound of the high-volatility regime (similar to P14=63 and P19=62). Historical patterns suggest this is a temporary oscillation within the dominant erratic regime (P15-Present), likely to be followed by a rebound toward the mean (~105) or a peak (~145). Reacting to this single low point by cutting inventory would expose the system to stockouts during the L=4 lead time. We maintain N=20 to ensure the forecast includes the upper-range risks (e.g., P31=145) and averages out the current dip.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime (P15-P41) persists. P41 demand (64) replicates the lower-bound noise seen in P19 (62) and P14 (63). This confirms the oscillatory baseline; N=20 remains the optimal horizon to balance these lows with regime peaks (e.g., P31=145) and avoid safety stock erosion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 observes a continuation of the high-volatility regime (active since Period 15). The recent low demand in Periods 41-42 (64, 65) precisely mirrors the deep troughs seen earlier in Period 14 (63) and Period 19 (62). This confirms that 'cooling' is actually just the lower bound of a violent oscillation (range 62-148), not a stabilization trend. Using N=20 is critical: it is long enough to include the high peak at Period 31 (145) while averaging in the recent lows, preventing the system from over-reacting to the dip. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillation confirmed: Periods 41-42 dips (64, 65) replicate the regime's established lower bound (P14=63, P19=62), validating a consistent oscillating range of ~60-148. N=20 remains the required horizon to capture this full amplitude (including the P31 high of 145) and prevent safety stock erosion during troughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reference Date: Period 44. Context: We are in a confirmed high-volatility regime (since Period 15) characterized by deep oscillations. The most recent cluster (Periods 41-43) represents a sustained trough with demand averaging ~64, drastically lower than the regime average of ~100-110. Changepoint Analysis: While this 3-period low tests the lower bound of the regime, the cost structure (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) strongly penalizes stockouts over holding inventory (ratio 4:1). Strategy: We must not over-react to the recent cooling. Reducing the forecast window (N) would discard the memory of high spikes (e.g., P31=145) and reduce safety stock, exposing the system to severe penalties if demand mean-reverts. Therefore, accurate parameterization requires staying the course with N=20 for both Mean and Sigma. This dampens the recent lows (pulling the mean down slightly to ~100) while strictly maintaining the variance data needed to buffer against the guaranteed regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained trough verified P41-43: Demand remained depressed (avg ~64) for 3 consecutive periods, proving the lower bound of the volatility oscillation can persist longer than previous single-period dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has remained in a low trough (avg 65) for 4 consecutive periods (P41-44), causing on-hand inventory to accumulate (215 units). However, the dominant regime since Period 15 is high-volatility, where 'cooling' trends often precede sudden reversions to high means (~110) or sharp spikes (e.g., P31=145). Reducing parameters now to chase the low demand is dangerous given the 4-period lead time. We maintain N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat; this window averages in the recent lows (lowering base stock naturally) while retaining critical memory of the volatility (P31, P28) to preserve safety stock against a sudden rebound.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Low demand trough confirmed sticky P41-44 (avg ~65), extending longer than previous dips in the high-volatility regime. This necessitates a cautious approach: while the forecast mean drops, safety stock (sigma) must account for the proven risk of rapid reversion to peaks (~145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 demand surged to 116 (+78% over the P41-P44 average of 65), effectively breaking the low-demand trough and reverting to the established high-volatility baseline (Period 15-present). This rebound confirms that the recent cooling was merely the lower bound of the oscillation, not a permanent shift. Current inventory coverage (approx 3.6 periods at demand 116) is insufficient for the 4-period lead time. I am maintaining 'recent_N' with N=20 to ensure the forecast mean (~98) helps bridge the gap between the recent trough and the regime peaks (e.g., P31=145), generating a replenishment order to protect against stockouts in the anticipated upswing.

Carry-over insight: Oscillation confirmed Period 45: Demand rebound to 116 (vs P41-44 trough avg 65) validates the persistent high-volatility regime (P15-present). The P41-44 lull was temporary noise; parameters must continue using long horizons (N=20) to smooth these deep troughs and retain peak visibility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High-volatility regime persists (P15-47). Recent demand P41-44 was a sticky low trough, broken by P45's spike (116). We maintain N=20 to smooth these deep oscillations and retain visibility of regime peaks (~148) to prevent safety stock erosion, although orders placed now will likely arrive after game end.

Carry-over insight: Sticky trough broken Period 45: Demand spike to 116 validated that the low-demand block P41-44 (avg ~65) was temporary noise within the persistent high-volatility regime. Oscillations continue.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 demand (127) firmly ends the low-demand trough (Periods 41-44, avg ~65) and signals a return to the upper range of the high-volatility regime. The rapid swing from Period 46 (81) to Period 47 (+57% increase) confirms persistent instability. To manage this oscillation, we maintain N=20 for both Mean and Sigma. This horizon successfully captures the full risk profile: it retains critical peaks (P31=145, P28=132) to support safety stock during rebounds, while smoothing the recent trough's dampening effect on the forecast.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillation persists: P47 demand (127) confirms the low trough of P41-44 was temporary noise. The regime continues to swing violently (Low ~60s, High ~140s). N=20 remains the critical horizon to effectively span this full amplitude including peaks (P31=145) and recent troughs.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: The high-volatility regime (active since Period 15) continues to dominate, characterized by violent swings between lows of ~60 and highs of ~148. Recent demand in Period 48 was 83, following a spike of 127 in Period 47, confirming the ongoing oscillatory behavior. The low-demand trough of P41-44 (avg ~65) has fully broken, returning to erratic variance. To manage this risk, we must maintain a long memory horizon (N=20) to smooth the recent deep troughs while retaining visibility of the critical peaks (P31=145, P47=127). Reducing N now would over-weight the recent lows and risk stockouts when the inevitable high-demand cycle returns. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillation persists: P48 demand (83) after P47 spike (127) reconfirms the erratic baseline. The regime (P15-present) is defined by rapid switching between ~60s and ~140s. N=20 remains the critical horizon to span this full amplitude (including P31=145) and prevent safety stock erosion during partial lulls.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. A stockout occurred in Period 49 (demand 135 vs depleted inventory), confirming the dangerous volatility of the current regime. The recent demand pattern (P45-49 avg ~108) represents a sharp rebound from the P41-44 trough (avg ~65), validating the oscillatory nature of the demand (swings between ~60s and ~130s/140s). We continue with N=20 for estimation: this window effectively spans the full amplitude of the regime, capturing the recent variance, the deep trough, and the prior peaks (e.g., P31=145). This long horizon is necessary to maintain a safety stock buffer (via sigma) that accounts for sudden spikes like P49, while the mean adjusts naturally to the recent upward trend. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Stockout Period 49 (demand 135) reconfirms the high-volatility regime. The sustained trough P41-44 has ended; P45-49 avg ~108 with high variance (81-135). N=20 remains critical to capture the full oscillation amplitude (inc P31 peak 145) and ensure recovery.
