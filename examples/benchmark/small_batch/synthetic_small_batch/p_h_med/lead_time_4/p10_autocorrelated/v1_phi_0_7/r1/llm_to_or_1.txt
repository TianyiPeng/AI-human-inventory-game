Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_small_batch\p_h_med\lead_time_4\p10_autocorrelated\v1_phi_0_7\r1\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 81), ('Period_2', 97), ('Period_3', 100), ('Period_4', 84), ('Period_5', 70)]
  Mean: 86.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No prior history or arrivals exist. I cannot infer actual lead time yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 4 periods. With L=4, the review period is L+1=5. I have demand history for Periods 1-5 (cheating slightly by looking at the provided 'Historical Demand Data' in the prompt, or treating it as pre-game context). The provided historical samples are [81, 97, 100, 84, 70]. 

Mean of these 5 samples = (81+97+100+84+70)/5 = 86.4.
Std Dev of these 5 samples \u2248 11.97.

My review period is L+1 = 5 periods. 
Forecasted demand over L+1 = 86.4 * 5 = 432.
Forecasted sigma over L+1 = 11.97 * sqrt(5) \u2248 26.76.

Since this is the very first period and I want to establish a robust base stock, I will use 'explicit' values derived from this initial dataset to ensure the system orders enough to cover the long 4-period lead time immediately. Waiting for 'recent_N' might be risky if the backend buffer is empty.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Observed Period 1 demand (124) was significantly higher than the provided historical average (~86), suggesting a possible demand spike or regime shift. Merged the 5 historical samples with the recent Period 1 observation to create a blended forecast (mean ~92.7). Using 'explicit' parameters to feed this updated view to the backend: mu_hat ~463 (5 periods * 92.7) and associated sigma. Given the short history, 'explicit' is safer than 'recent_N'. Current pipeline of 107 is insufficient for the 5-period cycle (L=4), but the backend's strict order cap (approx 95th percentile of daily demand) will limit recovery speed. I am setting parameters to target the correct base stock, accepting that the system will order at the cap limit to refill the pipeline over several periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 3. Observed demand in P1 (124) and P2 (95) averages 109.5, which is notably higher than the provided historical samples (avg ~86). With On-hand=0 and In-transit=231 covering only ~2 periods of demand, inventory is insufficient for the 4-period lead time (coverage needed for 5 periods). I am using explicit parameters derived from the recent P1-P2 average (mu=110, sigma=25) to ensure a sufficiently large recovery order is placed immediately to cover the 5-period protection interval (110 * 5 = 550 total). No arrival data yet to confirm lead time.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4. No arrivals observed yet, which is expected as promised lead time is 4 periods (Period 1 order arrives Period 5). Demand has shown a significant downward trend (124 -> 95 -> 66). Using recent_N=3 for demand parameters to capture this lower average (95) and current volatility (std~29) compared to initial expectations. Pipeline inventory (382) is substantial but expected given the long lead time. We stick to default L as no arrivals have occurred to validate or invalidate the 4-period promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend warning: consumption dropped 47% from P1(124) to P3(66).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start. No orders have arrived yet, which matches the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrives P5, visible P6). Demand history (124, 95, 66, 93) shows significant volatility but the rebound in P4 (93) suggests the drop in P3 (66) was not a sustained regime shift. The simulation history differs from the static prompt samples; relying on the 4 observed game periods. Using recent_N=4 for demand parameters to capture the full effective history and volatility of this run.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P4 rebound (93) indicates P3 drop (66) was noise/volatility rather than a sustained downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: P5 demand (120) rebounded strongly, confirming the P3 drop (66) was an outlier and establishing a high-volatility regime with an average ~100. First shipment arrived in P5, confirming actual Lead Time is 4 periods (ordered P1, arrived P5), matching the promised time. With 0 on-hand, P6 relies on the incoming P2 order. Using recent_N=5 for demand parameters to incorporate the full history of volatility into the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Daily Profit: $452.00, Daily Holding Cost: $11.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $441.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (P2 order arrived P6). Demand in the last two periods (120, 113) has been strong, bringing the game-history average to ~102, which is higher than the pre-game historical samples. Given the volatility (P3 dip vs P5 spike), we use recent_N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full distribution of the actual game history so far, prioritizing the higher observed mean over the lower pre-game data. Pipeline inventory (419) matches open orders exactly; no losses detected.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6). Demand stabilizing at higher level (avg ~116 for P5-P6), reducing weight of P3 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $583.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted to a higher regime (P7=149, P5-P7 avg=127.3). Using recent_N=3 for demand parameters to reflect this recent surge and filter out older, lower data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: avg demand surged to 127.3 in P5-P7 (vs ~94.5 in P1-P4).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P4 order arrived P8). All pipeline orders are accounted for (Total In-transit 405 matches history). Demand in Period 8 (118) aligns with the higher demand regime observed since Period 5 (avg ~125 for P5-P8), confirming that P1-P4 data is now stale. We adopt N=4 for demand parameters to target this specific high-volume regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates rather than being dragged down by early history.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (observed P5, P6, P7, P8 outcomes). The stockout in Period 9 was due to a zero-order placed in Period 5, not a lost shipment; Period 9 arrival was correctly 0. Demand in Period 9 (101) softened slightly but the recent regime (Periods 5-9) still averages significantly higher (~120) than the early periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to prioritize this more active regime and prevent future stockouts, while maintaining L=4 based on consistent observation.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 11. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods; the zero arrival in P9 was due to zero orders placed in P5, not a lost shipment. Demand average for the recent regime (P5-P10) is ~121, significantly higher than the early game average. We set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to focus on this active high-demand regime and exclude early low data. Pipeline is intact with 510 units covering the next 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12. Lead time is stable at 4 periods: all expected shipments have arrived on time, and current in-transit (516) exactly matches the sum of outstanding orders (P8, P9, P10, P11), confirming no losses. We are experiencing repeated stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P9, P10, P11) because demand has sustained a higher regime since P5 (Avg ~122.5) compared to the early game. To address under-stocking, we switch to 'recent_N' (N=7) for demand parameters, excluding the lower early-period data (P1-P4) and focusing the forecast on the active high-demand regime (P5-P11).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods; the absence of arrival in Period 9 is explained by the zero order in Period 5, not a lost shipment. Demand over the last 5 periods (avg ~115) shows a slight cooling from the peak regime but remains robust. Using recent_N=5 for demand to capture this mix of high peaks (130) and moderate dips (99).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Lead time stability confirmed (P5 order was 0, explaining P9 null arrival). Demand stabilizing around 115 (P8-P12 avg) after previous surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 status: On-hand 120, In-transit 391. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised = observed). Demand Analysis: Recent periods P12 (99) and P13 (92) show a downward trend compared to the strong volatility of P5-P11 (avg ~122). However, given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding), it is risky to cut safety stock too aggressively based on just two data points. We elect to treat the demand regime as starting from the major shift in P5. Selecting N=9 (P5-P13) captures the full elevated period (avg ~116) including high volatility, ensuring the base stock covers potential rebounds to levels seen in P11 (130). Pipeline inventory (511) is slightly below the target for 5 periods of demand (~580), prompting a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling signal: P12-P13 avg (95.5) is noticeably below the P5-P11 sustained high (~122), suggesting potential regime reversion or softening.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 15. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P14 arrival confirmed LT=4 for P10 order). Start of P15 reveals a sharp continuation of the cooling trend: P14 demand dropped to 61 (a historical low), following 99 (P12) and 92 (P13). The average for the last 3 periods is 84, significantly lower than the P5-P11 peak average of ~122. With a total pipeline of 556 units (137 on-hand + 419 in-transit), we are well-stocked for this lower demand level (covering >6 periods of demand). To prevent overstocking as consumption falls, I am narrowing the forecast window to N=3 to rapidly adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to the new low regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: P14 hit historical low (61); 3-period avg (P12-P14) is now 84, down ~31% from the P5-P11 peak level (~122).

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 Context: Demand remains in a distinct 'cooling' regime. P15 demand (78) aligns with the low levels seen since P12 (99, 92, 61, 78), averaging ~82.5 units/period. This is a sharp contrast to the previous peak average of ~122. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (validated by P11 order arriving in P15). Current total inventory (On-hand 186 + In-transit 292 = 478) provides ~5.8 periods of coverage at current demand rates, suggesting an overstock situation as we transition off the peak. I am selecting 'recent_N=4' for demand parameters to strictly focus the OR engine on this lower consumption rate, preventing unnecessary ordering while we burn down excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime persists: P15 (78) keeps 4-period average at ~82.5, confirming the drop from the P5-P11 peak (>120) is sustained. We are now in a distinct post-peak cooling phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: We are firmly in a low-demand regime. The last 5 periods (P12-P16) average 80.4 units, a sharp contrast to the ~123 unit average seen in the peak phase (P5-P11). The most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) are even lower, averaging 70.3. With on-hand inventory at 240 (due to high-volume orders arriving into this slump) and 166 in transit, our total pipeline covers roughly 5+ periods of current demand. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. We set forecast parameters to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the sustained cooling (avg ~80) while retaining slight buffer from P12/P13 data to protect service level (CR=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established: Last 3 periods (P14-P16) all < 80, averaging 70.3, confirming the 'cooling' has settled into a concrete low-volume baseline ~70.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand surged to 122, abruptly ending the 3-period 'cooling' trend (avg ~70) and returning to the high volumes seen in P5-P11. This significantly increases uncertainty. Given the high service level target (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 implies 80% SL), relying on the low recent average is risky. I am expanding the estimation window to N=8 (spanning periods 10-17) to incorporate both the high-demand regime and the recent dip, resulting in a higher mean (~98) and larger variance estimate. This ensures the inventory target rises to cover potential sustained high demand while accounting for the confirmed volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound/volatility: Period 17 spike (122) broke the 3-period low trend (avg 70.3), signaling that the P14-P16 dip was likely temporary or a volatility swing rather than a permanent reduction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 demand (107) confirms the rebound signal from Period 17 (122), indicating that the low-demand trough of P14-P16 (avg ~70) was likely temporary. The system appears to be returning to the previous normal/high regime (>100). Given the sharp volatility (drop to 61, spike to 122), I am using a longer window (N=10) for demand estimation. This yields a mean (~99) that balances the recent highs with the preceding dip, while naturally increasing the standard deviation to boost safety stock. This ensures coverage against both a sustained return to >110 demand and any lingering instability. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods with no missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Rebound confirmed: P17-P18 avg (114.5) breaks the P14-P16 low trough (avg ~70), signaling a return to the historic normal/high regime (~100-120). Volatility remains high as the system stabilizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 begins with a precarious inventory situation: on-hand is 94, and arrivals for P20 are 0 (due to P16 ordering 0) and for P21 are low (25 units). A stockout risk exists in the immediate term, which underscores the high cost of recent conservative ordering during the volatility. Demand in P19 (83) dropped from the P17-P18 high (~115 avg), demonstrating significant oscillation rather than a stable trend. Given the high profit margin (CR ~80%) and observed volatility (range 61-122 in last 6 periods), I am prioritizing service level. I set Lead Time to default (stable at 4). I use a short memory (N=3) for mu_hat (avg ~104) to stay responsive to the higher potential demand, avoiding the drag of the P14-P16 trough. I use a slightly longer window (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture the full extent of the recent swings (61 to 122) for adequate safety stock buffering.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime confirmed: P19 (83) drop following P17-P18 surge (122, 107) indicates demand is oscillating significantly (range 61-122) rather than settling into a stable high or low regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Stockout predicted for P21 (On-hand 0 + Arrival 25 < Forecast ~100). Pipeline (447) matches pending orders perfectly; no losses. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Demand Analysis: The system has recovered from the P14-P16 dip (avg ~70) but has not fully returned to the P5-P11 highs (~125). P17-P20 average is 103, with significant volatility (range 83-122). Strategy: Lead time remains 'default' (4). For demand (mu_hat), use 'recent_N' with N=4 (avg ~103) to follow the recent recovery closely and avoid under-stocking caused by the older dip data. For volatility (sigma_hat), use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full range of recent instability (inputs 61-130), ensuring safety stock buffers against both dips and spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilizing detected: Last 4 periods (P17-P20) average 103, suggesting recovery from the P14-P16 dip (avg ~70) to a moderate baseline ~100, though volatility remains present (83-122).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21). Demand continues to be highly volatile with no settled regime (last 5 periods: 122, 107, 83, 100, 73), averaging ~97 units. We use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this full range of behavior without over-biasing towards the most recent low point or the earlier spikes. The pipeline is currently heavy (531 units in transit) due to aggressive ordering in P18-P20, which will correct the recent stockouts starting this period (P18 order arrives P22). The OR logic will naturally dampen new orders given the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility persists: P21 (73) continues the erratic pattern (Last 5: 122, 107, 83, 100, 73; Avg 97). No stable mean established yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 23. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (promised). Demand remains volatile but is showing signs of centering around a mean of ~90-95 (Last 6 avg: 95.5; Last 5 avg: 90.2). The recent range (73-107, excluding P17 spike) suggests the extreme volatility of P14-P17 is dampening. We select significant history (N=6) to capture the P17 spike in the variance estimate (sigma) for safety stock calculation, ensuring we cover potential rebounds, while centering the mean forecast on the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand oscillating around new mean ~90 (Last 5 periods avg 90.2), dampening from previous extremes (61-122).

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: On-hand inventory is 82, with 319 units in transit (matching exactly the sum of orders from P20, P21, and P23, confirming no lost shipments). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand in Period 23 was 110, continuing a volatile oscillation pattern (recent values: 83, 100, 73, 88, 110). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) is roughly 89.4, suggesting a stationary mean despite the variance. We select 'recent_N' with N=10 for both demand and volatility parameters to capture this full oscillation cycle and smooth the fluctuations, ensuring the safety stock accounts for occasional spikes (like P17's 122) without reacting too sharply to noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (order from Period 20 arrived in Period 24). Demand has strengthened and stabilized in the last two periods (P23: 110, P24: 109), pulling the 5-period average up to ~96 despite the dip in P21. We use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recovery trend while smoothing out recent volatility. For sigma_hat, we use recent_N=10 to maintain a robust safety buffer against the wider fluctuations (range 61-122) observed over the last 10 periods. No missing shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization signal: P23-P24 averaged 109.5, significantly higher and more stable than the erratic P19-P22 period (avg ~86), suggesting a regime likely settling above 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: On-hand is 139, but P22 placed an order of 0, meaning 0 units arrive this period. With demand averaging ~93 (last 5 periods), on-hand will drop significantly (est. ending ~45). The subsequent arrival for P27 is also lean (68 units). This creates a pipeline risk for P27-P28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. P25 demand (85) shows the previous upward trend (109, 110) was not sustained, reverting the average to match the volatile moderate regime of ~94. We select mu_hat/sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to smooth this volatility (range 73-110) while ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to trigger replenishment for the lean pipeline segments.

Carry-over insight: Regime update: P25 demand (85) invalidates the P23-P24 signal of stabilizing >100. P21-P25 average is 93, confirming a moderate but highly volatile regime (amplitude 73-110) persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27 on-hand (37) + incoming orders (360) = 397 total inventory, covering roughly 4 periods of demand (avg ~98). We face a potential stockout risk in the immediate future as pipeline inventory is tight against the 4-period lead time. Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P22 order of 0 correctly arrived as 0 in P26). Demand over the last 10 periods (P17-P26) averages 97.9, showing a stabilization from previous extremes, although volatility persists. Using recent_N=10 for parameters captures this recovery regime while retaining enough history to account for variance (e.g., P17 spike, P21 dip), ensuring a robust safety stock calculation to mitigate the impending low inventory situation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility decreasing: Last 5 periods (P22-P26) range 85-110, significantly narrower than the prior 5 periods (P17-P21) range of 73-122. The process is stabilizing around a mean of ~98.

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand (96) further confirms the stabilization of the regime around an average of ~100 units, with significantly reduced volatility compared to the P14-P22 era. Recent 5-period average is 100.4 with a standard deviation of ~10.3, indicating a much tighter range (85-110). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived P27 correctly). Pipeline is healthy (413 units), but on-hand (9) plus immediate arrival (83 from P24) totals 92, which is tight against the mean demand of 100, suggesting a minor stockout risk this period. We select 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to tightly track this stable, low-volatility baseline and avoid overstocking based on older, more volatile data.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability persists: P27 demand (96) reinforces the ~100 unit baseline established over P23-P27, with volatility significantly reduced compared to the erratic P14-P22 phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 demand (92) further confirms the stabilization trend observed since Period 23. The last 5 periods (P24-P28) average 96.8 with significantly reduced volatility compared to the P17-P22 window. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P24 order arrived P28). Currently on-hand inventory is 0, so service depends entirely on pipeline/new arrivals. I will use a recent_N=6 for mu_hat (avg ~99) to track the stable mean, but maintain a wider window (N=10) for sigma_hat to include earlier volatility, ensuring safety stock remains sufficient to buffer against stockouts like the one in Period 28.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed P24-P28: Avg ~97 with reduced volatility (range 85-109), solidifying the recovery from the P14-P16 dip and settling into a regime just under 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 analysis: Demand in Period 29 spiked unexpectedly to 151, a +54% increase over the previous 5-period average (~98), resulting in a stockout (Observed demand 151 > On-hand+Arrivals). This shatters the stabilization trend observed in P23-P28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P25 order arrived P29). Pipeline inventory (392 units) matches expectations with no lost orders. Given the high cost of stockouts (Ratio 0.8) and the new volatility, we switch to a reactive recent_N (N=5) strategy. This captures the P29 spike in both the mean (raising target inventory) and the standard deviation (increasing safety stock) to buffer against potential ongoing volatility or a new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand shock P29: Demand spiked to 151 (+54% vs P24-P28 avg of ~98), causing stockout. This invalidates previous stabilization signals and re-introduces high volatility/risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision. Demand has shifted significantly upward. Following the P29 spike (151), P30 demand remained high at 122, averaging 136.5 over the last two periods compared to the previous ~97 baseline. This confirms a new high-volume regime. Persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 3 consecutive periods) and the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit ratio) necessitate an aggressive response. I am switching mu_hat to a short memory (recent_N=3) to rapidly align the base stock with this new ~120+ level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: P30 (122) following P29 (151) confirms shift from ~97 baseline to >120 level. Stockout risk remains critical.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 demand (135) confirms the high-volume regime triggered in Period 29 is sustained. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) is 136, a massive increase from the P24-P28 baseline (~97). The system is currently stocking out (P29-P31 ending inventory = 0) because earlier orders were calibrated to the lower baseline. To correct the service level and rebuild safety stock, I am switching mu_hat to a tight recent_N (N=3) to fully capture this new mean ~136. Sigma is set to N=5 to capture the volatility of the regime transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime solidified: P29-P31 average is 136, confirming a hard shift from the prior ~97 baseline. Stockouts persist due to pipeline lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. We are in a high-demand, high-volatility phase characterized by consecutive stockouts (P29-P32). While P32 demand (105) was lower than the P29 shock (151), the 4-period average remains elevated at ~128 (vs pre-shock ~97). 577 units are in transit, but the arrival for P33 is only 88 units (ordered P29), making another stockout highly likely given recent demand levels. Heavy orders placed in P30-32 (149, 162, 178) will arrive P34-36. To ensure coverage for P37 (the target of today's order) and prevent falling behind again, we use 'recent_N' (N=4) for demand and volatility to capture the full extent of the recent surge (avg ~128, std ~20). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within high regime: P32 (105) dipped below the recent spike avg (P29-P31 ~136), but the 4-period avg (~128) remains well above the pre-shock baseline (~97), confirming continued elevated consumption risk despite the single-period dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand remains firmly in a high-volume regime. The last 5 periods (P29-P33) average 126.4 units, significantly above the prior baseline of ~97. This surge has caused 5 consecutive periods of stockouts due to the 4-period lead time lag. Although specific periods fluctuate (105 to 151), the mean shift is sustained. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to force the forecast to respect this new high plateau and ensure the 590 units currently in transit are supplemented enough to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed sustained: P29-P33 average is ~126.4 (vs ~97 prior base), causing 5 consecutive stockouts. Volatility remains relevant (range 105-151).

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 35. Demand in P34 (85) showed a significant drop from the intense P29-P33 high-demand regime (avg ~126), allowing inventory to finally accumulate (ending on-hand 64). However, given the extreme volatility recently observed (range 85-151) and the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding), it is premature to assume the demand has fully reverted to the pre-spike baseline (~97). I am using recent_N=6 (P29-P34) for demand parameters to capture the average of the high-demand shock window (~119.5) while incorporating the recent softening signal. This provides a balanced forecast that buffers against a potential rebound without overreacting to the single low data point. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods; pipeline perfectly matches expected orders (516 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand softening/volatility: P34 demand (85) dropped sharply from the P29-P33 high average (~126), suggesting the surge may be cooling. However, volatility remains high (recent range 85-151), requiring caution before reverting to lower baselines.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observations (P36) show a clear cooling trend in demand. After the high-demand shock of P29-P33 (avg ~126), the last two periods (P34-P35) have dropped to 85 and 87 respectively (avg 86), suggesting a reversion to the pre-shock historical baseline of ~90-100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by P31 order arriving in P35). The inventory pipeline is currently heavy (415 in-transit + 139 on-hand = 554) due to high orders placed during the shock. To avoid massive overstocking while protecting against residual volatility (range 85-135 is still wide), we switch to 'recent_N=5'. This averages the recent low values with the tail of the shock, providing a glide path down for the base stock level rather than an abrupt cut, preventing stockouts if the drop is just volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-shock cooling confirmed: Demand in P34-P35 averaged 86, a sharp decrease from the P29-P33 shock average (~126), suggesting the high-demand regime has ended and is reverting to the ~95-100 baseline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 demand collapsed to a historic low (52), confirming the cooling trend observed in P34-P35. The high-demand shock (P29-P33 avg ~126) has decisively ended, replaced by a low-volume regime (Last 3 avg ~75). With significant excess on-hand inventory (265 units), the priority shifts to reducing holding costs. We use a short N=3 for demand to align forecasting with the new low baseline and halt unnecessary ordering, while maintaining N=5 for volatility to account for the erratic downward swing.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed: P36 hit historic low (52). P34-P36 avg is ~75, down ~40% from the preceding peak average (~126). We are definitively in a post-shock cooling trough.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: Demand has crashed to a new historical low of 41 units in P37, following a steep decline starting P34 (85, 87, 52, 41). The 4-period average is now ~66, roughly half the peak observed in P29-P33 (~126). Current inventory position (325 on-hand + 154 in-transit = 479) is excessively high relative to this new low-demand regime, driving up holding costs. We must halt ordering immediately to bleed off inventory. I am setting parameters based on the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to accurately reflect the collapsed demand and prevent the system from over-forecasting based on older data.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash deepens: P37 demand (41) sets a new historical low. The last 4 periods (P34-P37) average 66.25, confirming a severe contraction from the prior peak average of ~126.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 39. On-hand inventory is very high (321 units) due to deliveries arriving during a demand crash. Demand in P38 (79) rebounded from the P37 low (41), but the recent 5-period average (P34-P38) remains low at ~69 units/period, far below the peak levels of >120 seen in P29-P33. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. 

Strategy: The priority is to deplete the excess on-hand inventory (321 units) to reduce holding costs. The current Pipeline Inventory (On-hand + In-transit = 400) far exceeds the expected demand over the lead time horizon (approx 345 units based on recent avg). I will use 'recent_N=5' for both mu and sigma to reflect the current lower-volume, volatile cooling regime (range 41-87). This should generate a lower base stock level, resulting in an order quantity of 0, allowing inventory to align with the new demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected: P38 demand (79) nearly doubled the P37 low (41), signaling that the 'crash' may have hit a floor. The 5-period average (P34-P38) is ~69, confirming a low-demand regime persists despite this single-period volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context Check: Demand has confirmed a 'V-shaped' recovery, rising from the P37 low (41) to essentially normal levels in P39 (104). This invalidates the low-demand regime assumption. Note on Supply Gap: Due to the demand crash, orders in P37, P38, and likely P39 were zero. These zero-orders will result in zero-arrivals in P41, P42, and P43. With On-hand (278) + In-transit (18) = 296, we have roughly 3 periods of inventory coverage against a demand of ~100/period. We face a high risk of stockout in P43/P44 before today's order arrives. Parameter Strategy: We must ensure a maximizing order for Period 44 arrival. Using 'recent_N' with N=10 provides a demand estimate (~93) that balances the recent crash with the preceding shock, while the high standard deviation from this window ensures a large safety stock buffer to compensate for the upcoming supply drought.

Carry-over insight: Recovery confirmed: P39 demand (104) indicates the demand crash (P36-37) has ended, returning to the ~100 unit baseline. Pipeline is effectively empty for the upcoming 3 periods due to zero-orders placed during the crash.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has strongly recovered to the ~107-111 range (P39: 104, P40: 111), confirming the crash (P36-38) is over. However, the zero/low orders placed during the crash (Periods 37-39) have created a critical pipeline gap: 0 units will arrive in P41, P42, and P43. With current on-hand of 185 covering only P41 and part of P42, stockouts are inevitable in P42-P43. The order placed now (P41) will arrive in P45. We set parameters to target the recovered demand level (mu_hat recent_N=2) and use high volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=5) to buffer safety stock for P45 recovery.

Carry-over insight: Recovery solidified: P39-P40 demand avg 107.5 confirms return to >100 regime following the P36-P38 crash. Imminent stockouts expected in P42-P43 due to zero-orders placed during the crash phase (P37-P39).

Daily Reward (R_t): $355.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have successfully exited the demand crash (P36-P38). The last 3 periods (P39-P41) show a stable recovery with an average demand of 107.7 units, reverting to the pre-crash normal. However, due to the 'zero orders' placed during the crash (P37-P39), the supply pipeline is empty for the upcoming arrivals in Period 42 and Period 43. With only 77 units on hand and expected demand ~108, stockouts are unavoidable for the next two periods. My strategy is to aggressively rebuild the pipeline for P44 onwards. I am setting mu_hat using the recent 3 periods (capturing the true recovered mean of ~108) while keeping sigma_hat estimated over 10 periods to maintain a healthy safety stock buffer, reflecting the system's latent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recovery stable: P39-P41 avg ~108 confirms return to normal demand levels. However, unavoidable stockouts are confirmed for P42-P43 due to the zero-order gap from P37-P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 observes the continuation of the 'recovery' regime. Demand has been remarkably stable for the last 4 periods (P39-P42: 104, 111, 108, 110), averaging ~108.3 units. This confirms the demand crash (P36-P38) is over. Currently, we face an unavoidable stockout in P43 because the order placed in P39 (during the crash) was 0 units. However, heavy orders placed in P40-P42 (143, 159, 151) are in the pipeline and will restore inventory levels starting P44. We use 'recent_N' (N=4) for mu_hat to target this stable mean of ~108. For sigma_hat, we use N=12 to incorporate historical volatility (including the P30s spikes and crash) to maintain a healthy safety stock buffer against potential future fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Recovery stability confirmed: P39-P42 demand averaged ~108 units with low variance, establishing a solid post-crash baseline. Stockout in P43 is unavoidable due to previous zero-order gaps, but incoming pipeline (P44+) is sufficient to restore service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (92) dipped slightly below the P39-P42 average (~108) but remains consistent with a healthy recovery regime (avg ~105 for P39-P43). The stockout in Period 43 was an expected consequence of the zero-order placed in Period 39 during the crash. However, the pipeline is now fully replenished with 593 units (orders P40-P43), and the arrival of the P40 order (143 units) in Period 44 will restore service levels immediately. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (P39-P43) to focus exclusively on the stable post-crash recovery data, ignoring the older crash artifacts.

Carry-over insight: Recovery stabilization confirmed: P39-P43 demand averages ~105 units. P43 demand (92) likely represents normal volatility rather than a trend shift. Service levels expected to normalize in P44 as pipeline arrivals resume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $377.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have successfully exited the stockout crisis. Period 44 concluded with 39 units on-hand, confirming service restoration. Demand has stabilized in the P39-P44 window, averaging ~105 units with low volatility, marking a clear recovery from the P36-P38 crash. The variance (sigma) is also significantly lower than the crash/spike periods. We select 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand and volatility to capture this specific post-recovery stable regime. The current inventory position (39 on-hand + 450 in-transit = 489) is slightly below the target base stock (~530-540 for 105 demand rate), so a moderate replenishment order occurs naturally to maintain coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed: P39-P44 average 104.8 units. High pipeline inventory (450) and restored on-hand (39) confirm the end of the stockout crisis.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
P45 demand spiked to 137, breaking the stable ~105 average. Using recent_N=7 (P39-P45) captures this volatility (avg ~109) without overreacting. Critical pipeline gaps in P48-P49 (due to prior zero-orders) will deplete inventory; this P46 order arrives in P50 and must fully support final period demand. High profit margin justifies prioritizing service level over end-of-game holding cost risks.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand spike (137) breaks the stable recovery trend (~105), signaling potential volatility near the horizon end. Pipeline gaps for P48-P49 confirm unavoidable stockout risks before the final P50 arrival.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 47. Demand in P45-P46 (137, 145) confirms a new high-volume surge, significantly breaking the stable recovery baseline (~105). This late-game volatility mimics the P29-P33 shock key. While immediate arrivals (P47) are strong, severe pipeline gaps exist for P48 (arrival 0) and P49 (arrival 49), making stockouts unavoidable in those future periods given the L=4 lag. We switch to recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high consumption rate (~129 avg) for any final inventory balancing.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P45-P46 avg 141 is significantly above the prior recovery baseline (~105), indicating a late-horizon high-demand volatility phase similar to P30-P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 48/50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods (observed in all recent conclude messages including P47), an order placed today would arrive in Period 52 (48+4). Since this arrival occurs after the simulation horizon (Period 50), it cannot contribute to sales. To prevent unnecessary pipeline accumulation or potential post-horizon holding costs, we explicitly set demand parameters to 0 to force the backend to stop ordering. Contextually, demand has entered a high-volume surge (P45-P47 avg ~144.3), but this insight is only relevant for historical tracking as no new orders can satisfy this demand.

Carry-over insight: End-of-horizon demand surge confirmed: P45-P47 avg 144.3 units (+37% vs P39-P44 recovery baseline), signaling unexpected late-game consumption spike.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 of 50. Demand has surged aggressively at the end of the horizon, reaching an all-time high of 165 in Period 48. This confirms the 'end-of-horizon surge' identified in previous periods. With only 1 period remaining after this one, and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 53 (outside the simulation horizon). However, to truthfully represent the demand environment to the OR controller, we utilize strict recent-N estimators (N=3) to capture the sharp upward trend (avg ~154). We currently face unavoidable stockouts in P49 and P50 as incoming pipeline (49 and 132 units respectively) is insufficient to cover the new demand levels (~165).

Carry-over insight: End-of-horizon demand surge intensifies: Period 48 demand (165) sets a new record, pulling the P45-P48 average to 149.5 (+42% vs the P39-P44 recovery baseline). This confirms a sustained, high-intensity deviation to close out the horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50/50 (Final Decision). We are in a confirmed 'End-of-horizon surge' regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P45-P49) has averaged 147.8 units, significantly above the historical ~100 baseline, peaking at 165. Although orders placed now arrive in Period 54 (outside the horizon), we maintain a consistent policy reflecting the high demand state. An expected arrival of 132 units (ordered P46) will likely be consumed entirely by the expected demand (~148), resulting in a final stockout or near-zero inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: End-of-horizon demand surge sustained through the finale. P45-P49 demand averaged ~148 units (peaks at 165), approximately +50% over the mid-game recovery baseline. The horizon closes in a high-volatility, high-demand regime.
