Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1: Initial setup. We have 5 historical data points provided in the context (141, 118, 67, 94, 89). The mean demand is 101.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, we have no observed lead time data to update L, so we rely on the promised lead time (4). We will use the 'default' methods for mu and sigma which utilize the full historical dataset provided to establish a baseline. We need to cover demand for current period + lead time (1+4=5 periods). With zero inventory, the system will order significantly to reach the target base stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision. Promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive valid for demand in Period 7 (visible start P7). Current pipeline inventory (149) is insufficient for L+1=5 periods of demand. Observed Period 1 demand (91) is slightly lower than the provided historical sample average (~102, derived from Periods 1-5 context). Given the high critical ratio (0.8), stocking out is costly. Adopting a robust forecast based on the combined history (~100/period) to bring base stock up immediately. Sigma estimated at ~30 based on historical volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders placed in Period 1 will arrive in Period 5 and be visible in Period 6. No shipments have arrived yet, so we maintain the default lead time. Demand in Period 2 (130) showed a significant increase over Period 1 (91) and the pre-game history average (~102). To account for this volatility while utilizing the broader historical context, we calculate explicit parameters based on the combined dataset (pre-game + P1/P2). The combined mean is approx. 104.4 units/period, and standard deviation is ~26 units/period. Over the protection interval of 5 periods (L+1), this yields mu_hat = 522 and sigma_hat = 58. This ensures we cover the higher variance observed in P2 without overreacting to a single point.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 4. Game History shows observed demands for P1-P3 (91, 130, 114) averaging ~112 units. This contradicts the provided static historical data block, so I am prioritizing the actual Game History logs. No orders have arrived yet (Promised Lead Time is 4 periods, so P1 order arrives in P5), thus no lead time deviation is observed. With zero on-hand and 447 units in transit (expected to cover arrivals in P5, P6, P7), I will use 'recent_N=3' to parameterize the OR model based on the actual observed demands of this session.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 active. First order (placed P1) is expected to arrive during this period (L=4), visible in P6 start. In-transit inventory (591) exactly matches cumulative orders P1-P4, confirming no pipeline losses yet. Perceived demand P1-P4 (91, 130, 114, 118) averages ~113. Using recent_N=4 to parameterize the OR model based on the full observed history of this run. Pipeline is currently heavy relative to demand, so the system may curb ordering to balance holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. Reviewing history: P1 order arrived in P5 (visible in P5 conclude), confirming the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods. All outstanding orders (P2, P3, P4, P5) sum to 448, matching the 'in-transit' count, so no orders are lost. Observed in-game demand (periods 1-5) averages ~112 units, distinct from preamble samples. I will use 'recent_N=5' for demand parameters to rely on the actual game history outcomes rather than pre-game estimates. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as observed data aligns with promise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). In-game demand stabilized ~112 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand (46 units) dropped significantly below the prior average (~112), breaking the previous stable trend. Actual lead time remains consistent with promised (4 periods), confirmed by Period 2 order arriving in Period 6. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to use the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to calculate observed mean (~101) and volatility based on actual game history, rather than pre-game priors, to account for the P6 dip while maintaining coverage for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, P3 arrived exactly on schedule in P5, P6, P7). Demand has shown significant volatility recently (P6 dropped to 46, P7 recovered to only 86), bringing the recent average down significantly from the initial ~112 level. Given the high standard deviation in the last few periods, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the lower average demand (~94 over last 5) and the increased variance, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the recent instability. Current inventory position (209 + 266 = 475) is getting tight against the 5-period exposure (~470 demand + safety stock), so a replenishment order is anticipated.

Carry-over insight: Demand average shift: recent 4-period avg declined to ~89 (from historical ~112) with increased volatility. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Orders from P5-P8 account for the 173 in-transit units exactly, confirming no lost orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 4 consecutive observed arrivals. Demand in P8 (103) suggests stabilization after the P6 dip (46). We use 'recent_N=5' for demand parameters to capture this recent volatility (std dev ~28) and the shifted mean (~92), which is lower than the initial historical average but recovering from the P6 low. 'calculate' is used for L as observed history is perfectly consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 10. Demand has stabilized/recovered in the last 3 periods (avg ~96) following a significant dip in Period 6 (46 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (promised matched actual for all observations P1-P5). 

Strategy: 
1. mu_hat: Use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent stabilized demand level (~96) while excluding the Period 6 outlier which would artificially depress the forecast. 
2. sigma_hat: Use 'recent_N' with N=5 to deliberately INCLUDE the Period 6 volatility in the variance calculation. This increases safety stock to protect against potential recurrent drops or spikes, aligning with the high 0.8 critical fractile. 
3. L: Default (promised) matches actuals perfectly.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilizing: avg of last 3 periods (P7-P9) is ~96, recovering from P6 dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $431.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Demand in P10 spiked to 137, rebounding from the generic dip in P6-P7. I am using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this range (low of 46, high of 137) without over-indexing on the single high data point from P10. This ensures the safety stock accounts for the renewed volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (matches promised). Demand shows high volatility (recent range 86-137) with a 5-period average of ~102 units. Current inventory (51) plus expected arrival (P8 order of 51) provides ~102 units for P12, which is borderline compared to average demand, risking stockout. In-transit inventory (395) fully reconciles with past open orders (P8-P11). To maintain adequate service levels given the volatility and high shortage cost ($4 profit vs $1 holding), we use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (capturing the trend around 102) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat (capturing the full volatility range including outlier P6 and P10).

Carry-over insight: Demand average over last 5 periods (P7-P11) is ~102, with significant volatility (std dev ~21). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by P12 arrival of P8 order). Demand in recent periods (P11=86, P12=87) has softened compared to the P10 spike (137), but the 5-period average remains robust at ~102 units. Given the short on-hand inventory (15 units), it is critical to maintain responsive replenishment. I am using 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu and sigma to capture the volatility of the recent window (P8-P12) while filtering out older, less relevant data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (P13 arrival confirmed P9 order). Demand shows high volatility (swinging between 86 and 137 in last 5 periods) but averages ~105 units/period recently. Inventory stocked out in Period 13 due to a demand spike (118 units). To recover service levels and account for observed volatility, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both demand mean and variability, ensuring the replenishment target reacts to the recent high-demand signals (P10, P13).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile with no single stabilized mean; recent 5-period average is ~105 with std dev ~22. Lead time solid at 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is critical at 0 units after stockouts/depletion in P13 and P14. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P13 and P14 matching P9 and P10 orders). Demand in the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has been volatile and trending higher (avg ~107.8, with P10 at 137 and recent P13/14 > 110), compared to the longer-term trend. To recover inventory and buffer against this volatility, we select N=5 for both mean and variance estimation, ensuring the P10 spike and recent high demand are factored into the replenishment logic.

Carry-over insight: Recent 5-period demand average (P10-P14) increased to ~108, with high volatility causing stockouts in P13/P14. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 16. Lead time reliably confirmed at 4 periods (P11 order arrived P15). Demand over the last 5 periods averages ~96 with a std dev of ~18. The recent P15 demand (77) lowered the moving average from the previous high of ~108. I will use recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture this mix of volatility and slight cooling, ensuring the base stock covers the 5-period risk horizon (Review+Lead) adequately considering the critical ratio of 0.8.

Carry-over insight: Demand average (last 5 periods) moderated to ~96 following a dip in P15. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $720.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 saw a massive, unexpected demand spike to 273 units (approx 2.7x the recent average), resulting in a stockout. This outlier drastically increases demand volatility and raises the short-term average. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) relative to holding ($1), we must react to protect service levels. I am switching to a recent_N=5 forecast for both mean and standard deviation; this incorporates the spike into the safety stock calculation (~133 mean, ~80 std dev) while still grounding the estimate in the prior 'normal' periods (P12-P15). Lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Alert: Massive demand spike in Period 16 (273 units vs ~100 historical avg) significantly impacts volatility estimates. Stockout occurred. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand (170) confirms the spike in Period 16 (273) was not an isolated outlier but part of a new high-demand regime, significantly exceeding the historical average of ~100. P17 ending inventory is 0, indicating a stockout. To recover service levels and adapt to this surge, I am switching to a very responsive estimation using 'recent_N' with N=3. This captures the high values of P16 and P17 while discarding older, lower data. Current actual lead time consistently matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: P16 (273) and P17 (170) indicate a major shift from historical average (~100). Immediate responsiveness required.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 observations confirm a massive, sustained demand regime shift. Demand in P18 was 232, following P17 (170) and P16 (273). This 3-period average is ~225 units, which is more than double the historical average of ~100 observed in P1-P15. We have been stocking out consistently for 3 periods (P16, P17, P18) because our inventory was calibrated for the 100-unit regime. The previous 'carry_over_insight' correctly identified the 'High demand regime'. We must aggressively increase our base stock targets to match this new reality. The promised lead time L=4 holds true (P14 order arrived P18), so the review horizon is 5 periods. I will switch to a 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu and sigma to tightly track this new high-volume explosion and discard the irrelevant low-demand history. With 0 on-hand and high pipeline (733 units), we need the target to be high enough to justify maintaining or increasing that pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime CONSOLIDATED: Average demand over P16-P18 is ~225 units (vs ~100 previously). Volatility is also extreme. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand eased in P19 (116) but the 4-period average (P16-P19) remains high (~198) and volatile due to the P16-P18 spike. To protect against stockouts (critical ratio 0.8) without severely overstocking if the spike is ending, I use recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma. This averages the recent spike with the latest drop.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~200+) observed P16-P18 showed signs of cooling in P19 (116), but 4-period average remains elevated (~198) with high volatility. Monitoring for return to baseline. Lead time stable at 4.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: 0 on-hand, 1102 in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived P20). The high-demand regime starting P16 persists; P20 demand (164) indicates P19 (116) was likely volatility rather than a return to baseline (~100). The 5-period average (P16-P20) is ~191 units with high standard deviation (~62). Given the massive in-transit inventory (1102 units), the system is well-buffered. I am setting N=5 for both mean and sigma to accurately reflect the current high-mean, high-volatility cluster. This will likely result in a small or zero order, preventing overstocking while maintaining safety stocks for potential spikes like P16.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed sustained but volatile: P16-P20 average is ~191 (vs ~100 historical). P20 (164) shows P19 (116) was a volatility swing, not a regime end. Pipeline inventory is now saturated (1102 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $635.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand (180) confirms the high-demand regime starting in Period 16 is substantial and sustained, despite the dip in Period 19. The average over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 189 units, significantly higher than the historical baseline of ~100. Using 'recent_N' with N=6 captures this elevated mean and the associated high volatility (standard deviation ~55). The pipeline inventory (837 units) plus on-hand (85 units) is 922. The target stock (approx 945 mean demand over 5 periods + safety stock) suggests a top-up order is needed. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: Period 16-21 average is ~189 units (vs ~100 historical). P21 demand (180) validates the shift. Lead time consistently stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are deep into the high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 189 units, significantly higher than the historical baseline of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P18 order arriving in P22). To ensure adequate service levels, I am setting N=7 for both demand and volatility parameters. This window captures the full extent of the new regime, including the initial spike (273) and the subsequent stabilization, ensuring the safety stock calculation accounts for the high variance (~50 units std dev) inherent in this new pattern.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime firmly established: Average over P16-P22 (7 periods) is ~189 units with significant volatility. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High demand regime (avg ~189) is now fully established over the last 8 periods. P21-P23 show stabilization around this new mean. Using recent_N=8 for both mu and sigma entirely excludes pre-shift data to prevent under-ordering. Lead time remains consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime stabilized: Average demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is ~189 units, nearly double the pre-P16 baseline (~101). Volatility has decreased in the last 3 periods (180, 189, 187).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains fully active. Demand in Period 24 (203 units) was strong, confirming a baseline near ~190 units/period (avg of P16-P24 is ~190.4). While recent volatility (P21-P23) appeared to stabilize, P24's increase suggests we should retain a wider variance estimate to protect against spikes like P16/P18. Therefore, I am using recent_N=9 for both mean and volatility to capture the entire distribution of this new regime (Period 16 to Period 24), ensuring the order quantity covers the ~190 mean plus sufficient safety stock for the high-margin SKU relative to holding costs ($4 profit vs $1 holding). Lead time remains reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: High demand regime persists with P24 demand (203) slightly elevating the recent trend. The mean since regime start (P16) remains steady at ~190 units/period. The tight clustering in P21-P23 (180-189) has widened slightly, reinforcing the need to consider the full regime's variance.

While volatility has decreased significantly in the last 5 periods (P21-P25 mean ~188, std~9), the regime's earlier history includes sharp spikes (up to 273). Given the favorable critical ratio ($4 margin / $1 holding), it is safer to base parameters on the full regime length (N=10) to maintain a safety stock buffer against potential recurrent volatility. Pipeline inventory (693 units) equals the sum of the last 4 orders, confirming no lost shipments. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order of 0 resulted in P25 arrival of 0).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: High demand regime stable continuously P16-P25 (avg ~189 units). P21 order of 0 confirmed arrived in P25, reinforcing 4-period lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 continues to hold steady. Over the full regime duration (P16-P26, 11 periods), the average demand is ~189 units/period, significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~100). Recent specific demand in Periods 21-26 has clustered tightly (180, 189, 187, 203, 180, 187), indicating the mean has stabilized near 190. Lead time consistency is confirmed: the Period 22 order arrived in Period 26 (4 periods), and the zero arrival in Period 25 was expected as Period 21's order was 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for both demand and volatility parameters to capture the full statistics of this active high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime robust and stable: Period 16-26 average remains at ~189 units/period. The volatility has noticeably decreased in the last 6 periods (P21-P26 range: 180-203), clustering tightly around the 190 mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand (122) dropped significantly below the recent high-regime average (~189), mirroring the temporary dip seen in Period 19 (116). Given the critical ratio favors service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), it is risky to react eagerly to a single low point which might be volatility. We maintain the assumption of the 'High Demand' regime (started P16). We set N=12 for demand parameters to average the entire high-volume period (P16-P27), resulting in a mean of ~183 and capturing the high standard deviation to buffer against rebounds. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime volatility check: P27 demand dropped to 122 compared to the ~190 regime average. This resembles the P19 dip (116) rather than a confirmed reversion to low demand. Lead time remains confirmed steady at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 29. Lead time is consistently identifying as 4 periods (validated again by P28 conclude showing P24 order arrival). The high demand regime (previously avg ~190) is showing signs of softening or increased instability. After a dip in P27 (122), P28 recovered only to 147, bringing the 5-period average down to ~168. This suggests the robust ~190 level may be fading or volatility is increasing. I am switching to 'recent_N=5' for both mu and sigma to capture this recent downward trend and volatility without overreacting to a single data point. The current inventory position (194 on-hand + 657 in-transit = 851) is close to the expected demand for the protection interval (~168 * 5 = 840), so ordering should naturally throttle down, preventing overstock if the regime is indeed ending.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime softening: P27 (122) and P28 (147) are well below the ~190 peak average, dragging the recent 5-period mean to ~168. Volatility has increased. Lead time remains confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $695.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 demand (219 units) reversed the downward trend of P27-P28, confirming that the high-demand regime (active since P16) is still in effect and simply highly volatile. The historical average for this regime (P16-P29) is ~184 units/period. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must protect against these recurring spikes. I set N=14 for demand and volatility to encompass the entire high-demand period, smoothing the recent dip while respecting the variance. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime validated: P29 demand (219) confirms P27-P28 dip was volatility, not a regime change. Average demand since P16 remains ~184 units/period with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $674.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High demand regime persists. P30 demand (205) and P29 (219) confirm that the P27/P28 dip was temporary volatility, not a regime change. The average demand since the shift in P16 remains ~186 units/period with significant variance (range 116-273). To ensure safety stock covers this volatility, we utilize the full regime history (N=15) for demand and variance estimation. Lead time continues to be confirmed at 4 periods (P26 order arrived P30).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: P29 (219) and P30 (205) demonstrate strong rebound from P27/P28 dip, confirming continued high-volatility regime (avg ~186). Lead time stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $807.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 32. Key observation: Demand in P31 was 227 and P30 was 205, strongly re-confirming the high-demand regime after the P27-P28 dip. The average demand since the regime shift (P16 onwards) is ~189 units. The most recent 3-period average (P29-P31) is ~217 units, suggesting the regime might be intensifying or just showing high variance. Pipeline inventory is 653 units. Expected arrivals: P28 order (99) arrives P32, P29 order (50) arrives P33, P30 order (252) arrives P34. On-hand is 101. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. I will continue using a `recent_N` method for demand to capture this high regime, focusing on the post-shift window (N=16 to capture P16-P31 history). Pipeline calculation: 101 + 653 = 754. Expected demand over L+1 (5 periods) @ ~190 is 950. We are understocked relative to L+1 demand.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime intensifying: Recent 3-period average (P29-P31) is ~217, significantly higher than the regime average of ~189. Volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $685.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 is facing an unavoidable stockout; on-hand (23) plus arriving Order P29 (50) = 73 units, while recent demand averages ~195. This is a delayed consequence of the dip in orders during the P27-28 demand lull. However, the pipeline for subsequent periods is healthy with orders of ~250 units arriving in P34, P35, and P36. The demand regime remains high and volatile (avg last 5 periods ~195). We continue to steer using recent averages to capture this high baseline without over-reacting to single-period noise like P32's 177.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists: Last 5 periods (P28-P32) average ~195 units, consistent with the post-P16 baseline of ~190. P29 low order (50 units) results in stockout in P33, demonstrating the sensitivity of this high-volume regime to single-period underestimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 start. Stockout occurred in Period 33 due to high demand (160) consuming the remaining inventory despite a timely arrival. The high-demand regime (active since P16) continues to display significant volatility. While P32 (177) and P33 (160) are lower than the peak in P31 (227), the 5-period average remains high at ~198 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 order arrived P33). To address the stockout and persistent volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5 periods (reflecting current volume ~198) and sigma_hat using the recent 10 periods (capturing the full swing of dips and peaks like P27's 122 vs P31's 227) to ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists with volatility: Recent moderation in P32 (177) and P33 (160) keeps the 5-period average (~198) consistent with the regime mean (~189), confirming no downward structural shift despite fluctuations.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High-demand regime persists with P34 (219) confirming the rebound. Low ending inventory (33) requires maintaining robust safety stock. Using recent_N=5 for mu/sigma (~198 avg, ~27 std) to reflect the sustained high volume and volatility since P30, ensuring coverage for spikes against the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime steady: 5-period average remains ~198 units, consistent with post-P16 shift. P34 demand (219) confirms P32/P33 were fluctuations, not a downtrend. Lead time stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $820.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High demand regime (avg ~190-200) persists through Period 35 (demand 221). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by P31 order arriving in P35. On-hand inventory (64) is low, but the incoming P32 order (254) arriving during Period 36 ensures availability (Total ~318 available vs Mean Demand ~200). Using N=10 for demand parameters effectively captures the regime's characteristic high volatility (ranging 122-227 over the last 10 periods) while validating the stable mean (~188).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed stable: 10-period average (P26-P35) is ~188 units, continuing the structural shift observed since P16. Volatility remains characteristic of this regime with single-period swings between 122 and 227.

Daily Reward (R_t): $742.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: The high demand regime (active since P16) continues with strong momentum. The last 3 observation periods (P34-P36) have all exceeded 210 units (219, 221, 212), suggesting the mean is stabilizing near the upper bound of the regime rather than reverting. The 5-period average is ~198 units, and standard deviation is ~28. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). With current inventory at 106 and a full pipeline, we face potential stockout risk if demand stays >210. I am using 'recent_N=5' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated recent mean (~198) and its variance, ensuring the base stock covers the 5-period lead+review horizon adequately.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime solidifies: P34-P36 demand consistently >210 units (avg ~217), suggesting stabilization at the upper end of the ~190 regime. 5-period avg remains ~198. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High demand regime persists. Lead time is confirmed 4 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~199) to capture the sustained high volume, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for regime volatility. Pipeline is catching up but demands aggressive replenishment.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime stable: P34-P37 demand averaged ~209 units, reinforcing the structural shift from P16. Volatility persists but lead time is confirmed reliable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 39. Demand in P38 was 203, consistent with the high-demand regime established since P16. The most recent 5-period average (P34-P38) is ~207 units, while the 10-period average is ~202, indicating a stable high plateau. Current on-hand inventory is critically low (13 units), but the arrival of P35's order (211 units) in P39 will provide ~224 units total availability, which barely covers the expected demand of ~207. Pipeline inventory is healthy (832 units). I am using 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat to responsively capture the recent sustained intensity (~207), and 'recent_N' (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the broader volatility profile of this regime. Lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime consolidated: 5-period average (P34-P38) is ~207 units, slightly exceeding the broader regime average of ~190. P38 demand (203) reinforces stability. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $896.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 Analysis: We are currently in Period 40. The 'Period 39 conclude' message shows demand at 228 units, resulting in a stockout (Supply 224, Demand 228). This continues the high-demand regime established around Period 16, which has now persisted for nearly 25 periods. 

Demand Analysis: The last 5 periods (P35-P39) have demands of [221, 212, 182, 203, 228]. The 5-period average is ~209.2 units, with a standard deviation of ~17.8. The longer-term post-shift average (since P16) is ~195 units. The recent trend is consistently above 200 units, suggesting we are at the higher end of the regime's variance. Stockouts have occurred in P33 and P39, indicating our safety stock is slightly too lean for the current volatility.

Lead Time: The 'Period 39 conclude' message confirms the arrival of 211 units ordered in Period 35. The actual lead time was 39 - 35 = 4 periods. This matches the promised lead time perfectly. There are no signs of lead time drift or lost orders.

Param Selection: I will maintain the use of 'recent_N' for demand estimation but set N=5 to capture the robust high-demand behavior (avg ~209) rather than diluting it with the slacker periods (P27/28) seen earlier. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=5 to reflect the current tightness and variance. Lead time (L) remains default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists and intensifies: 5-period average (P35-P39) increased to ~209 units, surpassing the broader regime average. Stockouts in P39 highlight the need for robust safety stock. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 41/50. Context: The high demand regime (average ~200+) continues, with the last 5 periods averaging ~204 units. Stockouts occurred in Period 39 and Period 40 due to demand (228, 195) exceeding available inventory/arrivals. The pipeline is robust with 890 units arriving over the next 4 periods, but margins are tight (e.g., P42 arrival is only 189). Method: Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility ensures the forecast adapts to the sustained high volume (~204) and recent variance, aiming to build sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, so 'default' is used.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists: 5-period average (P36-P40) is ~204 units, with stockouts in P39 and P40 underscoring the tight supply/demand balance. Lead time remains confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $968.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 ended with a stockout (demand 260, sales 242), continuing a sequence of three consecutive stockouts (P39-P41). The observation from Period 41 (260 units) is extremely high, pushing the 5-period average (P37-P41) to ~214 units, well above the previous regime baseline of ~190. Demand over the last 3 periods alone (P39-P41) averages ~228. This signals an intensification of the high-demand regime, possibly a late-season peak. The lead time remains reliably 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41). To address the persistent stockouts and this surging demand, I am aggressively updating the forecast to the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this peaks' magnitude immediately, rather than diluting it with the 'cooler' P37-P38 data. Given the stockouts, a rapid response is necessary to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime surging: Demand in P41 (260) pushed the recent 3-period average to ~228 units/period, significantly exceeding the stable ~190 regime mean. Stockouts have occurred in 3 consecutive periods (P39-P41).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 43. Reviewing Period 42 conclude, actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (order from P38 arrived in P42). Demand in P42 (178) was lower than the P41 spike (260), but the regime remains high and volatile. The 5-period average (P38-P42) is approximately 213 units, significantly above the long-term stable mean of ~190, largely driven by the P41 surge. Given recent stockouts (P39-P41), maintaining a responsive 'recent_N' parameter set (N=5) allows the system to budget for this higher recent mean (~213) and volatility without over-anchoring on the single P42 dip. Pipeline orders match expectations perfectly, confirming no logistical losses.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists: P42 (178) tempered the surge from P41 (260), but the recent 5-period average remains robust at ~213 units/period (regime baseline ~190). Volatility is high. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $845.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 44. The high demand regime (begun P16) persists. Recent demands (P38-P43): 203, 228, 195, 260, 178, 218. The 5-period moving average is approximately 216 units, significantly higher than the long-term regime average (~190). Volatility remains high, with frequent stockouts in P39-P41. The arrival of 234 units in P43 helped recover inventory slightly (ending on-hand 27), but the buffer is thin. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P39 order arrived P43). Given the consistent high demand and recent surge (avg ~216), I will continue using a short-term recent_N estimate for both mean and variance to capture the current intensity and prevent further stockouts. No lost shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustains intensity: 5-period average (P39-P43) is ~216 units, exceeding the broader regime mean (~190). Volatility remains a key risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $598.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Lead time confirmed stable (P40 order arrived P44 -> 4 periods). Demand in P44 (170) was lower than the recent spike of P41 (260), causing the 5-period average to moderate from ~216 down to ~204. Despite the dip, the overall regime remains high-volume and volatile (Range P40-P44: 170-260). Given recent stockouts (P39-P41) and the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding), maintaining a robust forecast is prudent. Using recent_N=5 captures the high volatility and the elevated mean (~204) without over-reacting to the single P44 dip.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists with volatility: P44 demand (170) softened the immediate trend, reducing the 5-period average to ~204 (from ~216). Lead time remains confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $885.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation (Period 46 start): Lead time is stable at 4 periods (order placed P41 arrived P45). Demand remains in a high-intensity regime; Period 45 demand (226) indicates that the dip in P44 was a fluctuation, not a trend. The 5-period average (P41-P45) is ~210 units with high standard deviation (~37). On-hand inventory is critically low (19 units) against a pipeline of 845 units. I will use 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand parameters to reflect the sustained high mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation covers appropriate safety stock for the 80% service level target (based on margin).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained with oscillating intensity: P45 demand (226) reversed the brief dip, pushing the 5-period average back up to ~210 units/period (vs ~204 previously). Volatility remains high, requiring robust safety stock.

Daily Profit: $916.00, Daily Holding Cost: $72.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $844.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stretch of the game (Period 47/50). The high demand regime (beginning Period 16) remains dominant and stable. Demand in Period 46 was 229, consistent with the regime average of ~200-210. The 5-period average (P42-P46) is ~204.2, and the 10-period average (P37-P46) is ~210.6. Volatility remains high (recent std dev ~33), necessitating robust safety stock settings. 

Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P42 order arrived in P46). 

Inventory reconciliation:
- On-hand: 72 units.
- In-transit: 821 units.
- Expected Arrivals: 
  - Period 47: P43 order (210) should arrive.
  - Period 48: P44 order (232) should arrive.
  - Period 49: P45 order (121) should arrive.
  - Period 50: P46 order (258) should arrive.

Total pipeline (72 + 821 = 893) covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand (at ~205 avg). Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need coverage for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 205 = 1025. We are slightly understocked relative to the ideal pipeline for full coverage, especially given the volatility. I will maintain a recent_N strategy for mean and sigma to capture the current high-demand volatility without reacting too slowly. N=10 provides a stable estimate of the 'new normal' regime.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime steady: 10-period average (P37-P46) is ~210 units, confirming the structural shift is permanent for the game duration. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48/50. The high demand regime detected since Period 16 remains active and stable in its intensity. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), demand has averaged approx. 211 units/period, with the most recent 5 periods also averaging ~209 units. Volatility remains high (P45=226, P44=170), requiring robust safety stock settings. Actual lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). Given the approaching game end (Period 50), orders placed now (arriving P52) will not serve demand within the standard horizon, but we maintain the regime-consistent parameters to ensure protocol stability. P49 inventory is tight (projected available ~225 vs ~210 demand), highlighting the importance of the high base stock maintained previously.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime steady: 10-period average (P38-P47) is ~211 units/period, solidifying the ~210 baseline. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=207, arrived=232 units (ordered on Period 44, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=314, demand=203, sold=203, ending on-hand inventory=111
Daily Profit: $812.00, Daily Holding Cost: $111.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $701.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The high demand regime (active since P16) remains stable with a 10-period average of ~211 units and substantial volatility (std dev ~25). Lead time is consistently verified at 4 periods (P44 order arrived P48). Current on-hand (111) plus incoming P45 order (121) gives ~232 units available to meet expected demand of ~211, providing a slim buffer. We use recent_N=10 for demand parameters to capture the stable mean while accounting for recent volatility (including the P41 spike and P44 dip).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 50. The high demand regime (active since P16) continues to intensify. Demand in P49 was 237 units, causing a stockout as previous inventory coverage was insufficient. The 5-period moving average (P45-P49) has risen to ~219 units/period, while the 10-period average is ~212. To address the recent stockout and the upward trend, we set mu_hat using N=5 (responsive). However, volatility remains high (range 170-260 in last 10 periods), so we set sigma_hat using N=10 to capture a wider range of variance and ensure adequate safety stock. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (P45 order arrived P49).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime intensifying: P49 demand (237) caused a stockout. 5-period average (P45-P49) rose to ~219 units, exceeding the broader regime baseline (~210). Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.
