Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No prior history or concluded orders to analyze. Initializing parameters based on the full provided historical sample set (Periods 1-5 data provided in context). Product is 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) have a mean of 182 and a standard deviation of roughly 30. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). With a high critical ratio (0.8), we aim to act conservatively. Since we have no lead time history yet, we use the default promised lead time. For demand and uncertainty, we use the provided 5-period history as our initial baseline via 'default', which uses all available samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. No orders have arrived yet (Period 1 order will arrive in Period 5). Because I am in the early game, I rely on the provided historical demand samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) to establish my baseline. The mean of these 5 samples is 182, and the standard deviation is approx 33. Demand in Period 1 (observed 217) is consistent with the higher end of this history but not an outlier. I will use 'default' methods to utilize the full historical dataset provided in the prompt instructions, as there are too few in-game observations (only Period 1) to form a specialized trend. I will stick to the promised lead time of 4 until I have concrete arrival evidence.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 start. Current on-hand is 0 with 482 units in transit (due periods 5-6). Recent realized demand (217, 213) is slightly higher than the historical sample average (approx. 182), but historical samples indicate a potential drop in demand for Periods 3 and 4 (samples 170, 131). To avoid overreacting to the initial high demand and creating excess inventory as demand potentially softens, we utilize the 'default' method for demand parameters, which considers the full distribution including lower historical values. We maintain the default lead time (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decisions. Promised lead time is 4 periods, so Period 1 orders are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6 observe); zero arrivals so far is normal. Observed demand (217, 213, 163) shows a downward trend, averaging ~198. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 727, total inventory covers approx 3.6 periods of demand, which is below the target coverage of 5 periods (L+1). Using recent_N=3 for demand parameters to adapt to the recent drop in demand while managing the 4-period lead time risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5. Observed demand (P1-P4) averages ~193.5 units (217, 213, 163, 181). The first order placed in Period 1 (with promised L=4) is expected to arrive during the current Period 5 execution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Seeing 'arrived=0' in Period 4 conclude is consistent with L=4, as the first shipment is not due until now. With 975 units in transit (covering ~5 periods of demand), the pipeline is well-stocked. We use recent history (N=4) to parameterize the base stock policy, ensuring we react to actual realized volatility.

Daily Profit: $708.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $647.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 6. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5. This matches the promised lead time, so we use the default method for L. Actual demand history [217, 213, 163, 181, 177] shows a mean of ~190.2 and moderate volatility. The early periods (1-2) had slightly higher demand than recent periods (3-5), so using the full history (N=5) via 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable forecast that accounts for the observed range. On-hand plus imminent arrivals (Period 2 order expected now) are sufficient for immediate demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $660.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods (promised). Demand remains stable around ~190 units/period (avg of observed history). Using recent_N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full observed history of this session, while keeping default L=4. In-transit inventory aligns with expected arrivals for P7-P10, though P9 arrival will be low; current parameters ensure robust ordering to compensate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $653.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: Consistent observed lead time of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 163, 181, 177, 193, 202) averages ~183.2 units with a slight upward trend in the last 3 periods. Current on-hand inventory (155) plus in-transit (637) creates an inventory position of 792. The in-transit amount precisely matches the sum of pending orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7, indicating no lost orders. Since the order from P4 (248 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 8), stockout risk is minimal. I will use 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the recent demand levels (~183 mean) while smoothing volatility. Lead time remains 'default' as reliable history supports the promised value.

Daily Profit: $728.00, Daily Holding Cost: $221.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $507.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand remains stable with a recent average of ~187 units/period (last 5 periods). Lead time has been perfectly consistent at the promised 4 periods throughout the history (Period 1-4 orders arrived in periods 5-8). Inventory is healthy (221 units on hand). We continue with recent_N=5 for demand to maintain responsiveness to the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1-P4 orders arriving P5-P8).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed again by the Period 9 arrival of the Period 5 order. Demand shows recent volatility with a dip in P9 (158) compared to P7 (202), bringing the recent 5-period average to ~182. Given the variation, I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to align the forecast with the current fluctuation levels rather than the entire history. The service level target is 80% (profit 4 / (4+1)).

LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 10 arrival). Demand is stationary with a mean around 187; using full history (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most stable estimate. Inventory is adequate but slightly below the ideal 5-period cover, warranting a replenishment.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Demand is relatively stable, fluctuating between 158 and 217 (avg ~187). Current net inventory (788 units) covers ~4.2 periods of demand, slightly below the target for the L+1=5 period protection interval. Choosing recent_N=11 for demand parameters to utilize the full session history for a robust estimate, ensuring sufficient base stock to cover the review period plus lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 analysis: Pipeline inventory (741 units) matches exactly the sum of open orders from P9-P12 (192+147+218+184), confirming no lost shipments. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P8 order arrived P12). Demand over the last 6 periods (avg ~179, std ~18) shows a slight decrease compared to early game highs, but remains fairly stable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu and sigma to weight this recent demand level appropriately, ensuring the base stock reflects the current ~180 unit/period rate rather than the higher initial history. L is set to default as promised matches actual.

Current Period 14. Reviewing history, lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (Order P9 arrived in P13 with L=4). In-transit inventory (664) perfectly matches the sum of open orders P10 through P13 (147+218+184+115), confirming no lost shipments. Demand has stabilized after the initial high of periods 1-2, averaging ~178 over the last 11 periods with moderate volatility. We select 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand and volatility to capture this stable regime while filtering out the initial transients. Lead time set to default as actual matches promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand stable around ~178 avg (P4-P13) excluding initial startup noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 Analysis: The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate, with the most recent arrival (ordered P10, arrived P14) confirming L=4. Demand is exceptionally stable. The last 10 periods (P5-P14) show a mean of ~178 with relatively low volatility. Using 'recent_N' (N=10) for demand captures this stable regime effectively, smoothing out the minor fluctuations. Lead time is set to 'default' as the observed average matches the promised 4 periods exactly. With on-hand inventory at 74 and a healthy pipeline (691 units in-transit), the capped order policy will balance replenishment against holding costs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised matching actual). Demand has shown a slight softening trend in the last 4 periods (P12-P15 avg ~165 vs prior P6-P11 avg ~185), but this fluctuation is within one standard deviation and not yet a confirmed regime shift. Given this, I will use a 10-period rolling window (recent_N=10) to smooth out the volatility while excluding the initial P1-P2 startup noise. This balances responsiveness to the recent dip with robustness against potential mean-reversion. On-hand plus in-transit inventory is 757, covering approx 4.5 periods of demand, requiring a new order to cover the full review+lead horizon (5 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 17. Lead time remains perfectly consistent at 4 periods (order from P12 arrived P16). In-transit inventory (601) matches exactly the sum of outstanding orders (P13-P16), confirming no lost shipments. Demand in Sensitivity: P16 saw a significant drop to 125 units, the lowest recorded. To prevent overreaction to a single low data point\u2014especially given the high critical ratio (0.8) favoring service level\u2014I am using a 10-period window for demand estimation (average ~170). This captures the recent softening trend (down from ~178) without aggressively cutting inventory based on potentially noisy volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend: 10-period average has declined to ~170 (previously ~178), driven by recent lows (P16=125).

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead time remains perfectly stable at 4 periods (promised). Demand has shown a sharp, sustained drop in the last two periods (P16=125, P17=124) compared to the historical average (~175). To adapt to this potential new lower demand regime without overreacting to noise, we switch to 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mean and volatility. This reduces the forecast baseline to ~150, mitigating holding costs if the low demand persists, while retaining some memory of the ~160-170 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: P16-P17 avg ~125, significantly below prior P1-P15 avg ~178.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted lower (avg ~131 over last 3 periods vs historical ~178), but Period 18 (145) suggests it might not be free-falling. I am switching to recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to adapt to this lower regime while smoothing the variance between 124 and 145. Lead time is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at lower level: P16-P18 avg ~131, distinct from historical ~178. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 demand rebounded to 172, significantly higher than the low-demand trough observed in P16-P18 (avg ~131). This suggests the dip might have been temporary or is stabilizing back to historical norms (~178). To balance the risk of overreacting to the dip while acknowledging the recent volatility, I am using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both demand mean and variability. This naturally increases safety stock (via higher sigma from the V-shaped demand pattern) while keeping the mean conservative (~146) as we confirm the recovery. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P15 order arrived P19).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected: P19 demand (172) breaks the low-demand trend of P16-P18, increasing recent volatility; Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand has recovered from the mid-teens dip (P16-17) back to historical norms (P19=172, P20=182). To balance the recent volatility with the return to normal levels, we use 'recent_10' for mu_hat (avg ~163, bridging the dip and recovery) and 'recent_5' for sigma_hat to capture the widened variance (low 120s to high 180s) for robust safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P19-P20 avg ~177 represents a return to historical norms after the P16-P18 transient dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $542.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: Demand has successfully stabilized following the dip in periods 16-18. The last 3 periods (P19-P21) show an average demand of ~172 (172, 182, 162), which is consistent with the long-term historical average prior to the dip. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory position (On-hand 106 + In-transit 519 = 625) is significantly below the target base stock required for 5 periods of demand (~860+), necessitating a large replenishment order. I am selecting 'recent_N=3' for mu_hat to focus strictly on the post-recovery demand levels and exclude the dip. For sigma_hat, I am using 'default' (all history) because the recent 3 samples show unusually low volatility (SD~10), and it is safer to buffer against the higher volatility seen in the full history (SD~20-25) given the holding/shortage cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P19-P21 average ~172, signaling a complete recovery from the P16-P18 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 Context: Current on-hand inventory is critically low (23 units), with dependence on the incoming P19 order (104 units) to meet P23 demand. Demand in P22 dropped sharply to 112, contradicting the recovery trend seen in P19-P21 (avg ~172). This confirms a pattern of high volatility rather than a stable regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Decision: Given the fluctuating demand (oscillating between ~125 lows and ~180 highs), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full recent cycle (the P16-18 dip, the P19-21 recovery, and the P22 drop), resulting in a forecast that balances the high and low periods (~152 avg) while increasing safety stock to account for the significant variance. The OR controller's high critical ratio (0.8) justifies carrying this safety buffer against stockout risks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified: Period 22 dropped to 112, breaking the recovery trend (P19-P21 avg ~172) and confirming an unstable regime alternating between ~120s and ~170s.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 decision. Faced a stockout in Period 23 due to a demand dip (130) combined with low prior inventory; however, the penalty for missed sales is 4x holding cost, necessitating a service-oriented recovery. Observed demand pattern is volatile, alternating between stable (~165) and dip (~120) phases (e.g., P16-P17 and P22-P23). Acknowledging this instability, I select a longer accumulation horizon (N=20) for mu_hat to anchor the forecast on the robust long-term average (~164) rather than over-reacting to the recent short-term dip. This aims to rebuild buffer stock. For sigma, I use a shorter horizon (N=10) to reflect the recently increased volatility in safety stock calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical demand volatility confirmed: P22-P23 drop (avg 121) replicates P16-P17 pattern, suggesting intermittent dips within a broader ~160-170 regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P24 matching P1-P20 orders). Pipeline inventory (683 units) matches the sum of outstanding orders, confirming no lost shipments. Demand exhibits a strong cyclical 'wave' pattern: a high phase (P19-P21 avg ~172) followed by the current low phase (P22-P24 avg ~117). Given the high cost of understocking (profit margin ~80%), relying solely on the recent low phase (N=3) risks stockouts if the cycle rebounds as expected. I select N=10 for both mean and volatility estimation to smooth across the full high-low cycle (~142 avg) and capture the significant variance (range 108-182), ensuring the safety stock buffer is robust against a potential upward demand swing.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical demand wave pattern identified: Alternating phases of ~3 periods high (~175, e.g. P19-P21) and ~3 periods low (~115, e.g. P22-P24). Current low phase appears mature; anticipating potential rebound.

Daily Reward (R_t): $547.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 demand (165 units) broke the recent low trend (P22-P24 avg ~116), signaling a return to the 'High' demand phase and supporting the cyclical 3-High/3-Low hypothesis. This rebound makes short-term averages (e.g., last 10 periods avg ~143) risky, as they are heavily weighted by the recent dip. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 ratio), using the full historical average (~164) provides a safer buffer to cover the anticipated 'High' demand and mitigate the vulnerability created by the minimal order in P25. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Rebound confirmed (165 units) ending 3-period low phase; supports 3-High/3-Low cycle pattern. The minimal order in Period 25 (4 units) creates a projected inventory vulnerability in Period 29.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (112) defied the expected 'High' phase of the 3-period cycle hypothesis, dropping immediately after P25's 165. This confirms that while the regime (P16-present) is volatile (ranging 108-182), it lacks strict periodicity. A strictly reactive strategy (low N) caused the dangerous 4-unit order in P25 (which creates a risk in P29) followed by a panic 218-unit order in P26. To mitigate this bullwhip effect and ensure coverage for the unpredictable 170+ peaks, I am switching to a longer smoothing window (N=11) covering the entire volatile regime since P16. This sets the forecast mean ~140, balancing the lows (110s) and highs (180s) rather than chasing the most recent datapoint. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical pattern disrupted: P26 (112 units) broke the '3-High/3-Low' expectation. The demand regime from P16-P26 is characterized by high, irregular volatility (108-182 units) rather than predictable waves.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current analysis shows demand has crashed significantly, with Period 27 hitting a historical low of 79, breaking the 'cycle' pattern and lowering the 5-period average to ~119. Volatility remains high (last 3 periods: 165, 112, 79). While the Critical Ratio (0.8) favors service, the current pipeline (670 units) is robust given the reduced demand (covering >5 periods). The small order in P25 (4 units) and P27 (47 units) creates lumpiness, but strong arrivals in P24 and P26 buffer the risk. I am setting parameters to reflect the recent downturn (N=5) to avoid overstocking, while capturing the high recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed: Period 27 hit historical low of 79, significantly below previous floor of ~108. Volatility range has expanded (79-165 in last 3 periods), invalidating the stable cycle hypothesis.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 decision. We are observing a significant demand crash ('Valley') that continues to deepen. The last two periods (P27=79, P28=90) are historically low, well below the previous 'Low' regime average of ~115-120. This confirms the volatility has expanded downward significantly. The '3-High/3-Low' cycle pattern has broken down into a more chaotic, high-variance regime. On-hand inventory is very high (311 units) due to the sudden demand drop against previous orders arriving. In-transit is 269. Total supply line is ~580. Even with a conservative 5-period demand coverage estimate (using recent low avg ~95 * 5 = 475), we are overstocked. We must aggressively cut ordering to burn down this excess inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. We will switch to a short-memory 'recent_N' estimator (N=3) to capture this new 'Crash' regime (avg ~94) and avoid overestimating based on older data.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash deepens: P27-P28 average ~85, defining a new 'Deep Low' volatility floor significantly below previous lows. Cycle pattern invalid; regime is now high-volatility/unstable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has effectively flatlined in a 'Deep Low' regime with P27-P29 average ~86 (range 79-90), replacing the previous volatility. I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=3) to tightly align the forecast with this new low baseline and burn down excess inventory (current position 491 vs ~430 need). However, I will maintain sigma_hat at 'recent_N' (N=5) to include the P25 spike (165 units) in the variance calculation; this keeps a safety buffer in case the low demand is transient or cyclical, protecting the 80% service level target against sudden rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Low demand stability confirmed: P27-P29 demand flatlined (avg ~86, range 79-90), validating the transition to a sustained Deep Low regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (149 units) surged +67% compared to the 'Deep Low' average of ~86 observed in Periods 27-29, signaling a break from that trend and a potential return to normal volatility. However, the system ordered nearly zero units during the dip (P28, P29, P30 orders were 0, 0, 5), leaving the pipeline critically dry (only 52 units in-transit total). With 295 on-hand and minimal arrivals, stockouts are likely in P33-P34 if demand persists above 100. To ensure recovery stock arrives by P35, we shift to 'recent_N=10' for mu/sigma (~120 forecast), which blends the recent lows with the prior normal range, prompting a larger replenishment order than a short-term average would.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled: Period 30 demand (149) broke the 'Deep Low' regime (P27-P29 avg ~86), indicating high volatility rather than a permanent crash. Pipeline vulnerability detected due to minimal ordering during the dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Period 31 demand (108) reinforces that the system has exited the 'Deep Low' regime (P27-P29 avg ~86), although it fell back from the Period 30 spike (149). The 5-period average is now ~103, characterized by high volatility (range 79-149). Critical Alert: There is a severe supply gap incoming. Orders placed in P28 (0 units), P29 (0 units), and P30 (5 units) will arrive in P32, P33, and P34 respectively, providing almost zero replenishment. Current on-hand (234) must stretch to cover demand until the P31 order arrives in P35. Stockouts are highly probable in P34/P35. Decision: We must aggressively restock the pipeline for Period 36 onwards. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma captures the current volatile recovery phase and ensures the safety stock calculation accounts for the high variance observed in the post-crash bounce.

Carry-over insight: Supply gap confirmed for P32-P34 due to zero/low ordering in P28-P30; stockout risk high. Demand recovery pattern confirmed: P30-P31 avg ~128 breaks P27-P29 deep low (<90), validating a shift to a volatile recovering regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand context: P32 demand (89) reverted to the 'Deep Low' range seen in P27-P29, contradicting the recovery signal from P30 (149). This confirms the current regime is defined by high instability and volatility (range 79-165) rather than a stable trend. A critical supply gap exists now: arrivals for P33 (0 units) and P34 (5 units) are negligible, making a stockout in P34 highly probable given current on-hand (145). To address the P37 horizon (L=4), I am setting parameters based on the last 10 periods (`recent_N=10`). This window averages ~112 units/period, balancing the deep lows with the recovery spikes, and captures the high standard deviation needed to buffer against future volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Volatility regime confirmed; P32 demand (89) reverted to lows after P30 spike, invalidating immediate stable recovery. 10-period average (~112) effectively smooths the 79-165 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 is facing an unavoidable stockout due to the supply gap from zero orders in P28-P29; the incoming Period 30 order (5 units) plus on-hand (24) totals only 29 units against expected demand of ~117. Demand analysis shows the 'Deep Low' (P27-P29, avg ~86) has definitively ended, with P30-P33 averaging ~117 units. While volatility remains high (range 89-149 in last 4 periods), the process has shifted to a recovery regime. I am switching to 'recent_N=4' for demand parameters to focus strictly on this post-crash recovery phase (P30-P33) and exclude the crash data, ensuring the replenishment target (~117 avg) is robust for when stock levels recover in Period 35 (when P31's 171 units arrive).

Carry-over insight: Volatile Recovery confirmed: P30-P33 demand averages ~117 (range 89-149), establishing a new active regime significantly above the P27-P29 crash floor (~85). Stockout in P34 is confirmed unavoidable due to prior order gaps.

Stockout confirmed in P34 due to prior low ordering. Order from P31 (171 units) expected to arrive in current period P35 to replenish stock. Demand has stabilized in a 'Volatile Moderate' regime (avg ~113 over last 5 periods). Switching to recent_N=5 for forecast to align with this new level (113) rather than the inflated historical mean. Lead time stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime refined: 'Volatile Moderate' phase confirmed (P30-P34 avg ~113), distinct from historical highs (>170) and crash lows (~86).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 conclude confirms lead time remains stable at 4 periods (order P31 arrived P35). Demand for Period 35 was 83, continuing the 'Volatile Moderate' phase (averaging ~108 over P30-P35: [149, 108, 89, 121, 98, 83]). This recent average is significantly lower than the historical mean of ~150-160, and volatility is high. The stockout in P34 was resolved by the arrival in P35, leaving 88 units on hand. There is a healthy pipeline (438 units in transit), consisting of orders from P32 (149), P33 (143), and P34 (140), expected to arrive in P36, P37, and P38 respectively. These incoming orders are quite large compared to the recent demand average of ~108, suggesting potential overstocking unless demand spikes. We will stick to 'recent_N' with a short window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current moderate regime (~108) rather than the older high regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 'Volatile Moderate' persists: P30-P35 avg ~108 (range 83-149), well below historical highs.

This level is distinct from both the historical high (~178) and the crash low (~86). Strategies adapt to this new normal by focusing on the last 7 periods (approx period 30 onwards), which excludes the outlier crash data of P27-P29 while capturing current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Volatile Moderate regime stability: P30-P36 average 109 remains consistent, effectively replacing historical norms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. The 'Volatile Moderate' regime identified in Period 30 persists through Period 37. Demand in Period 37 (101) aligns with the regime average. The 8-period mean (P30-P37) is approximately 108 units, distinct from the prior crash (~86) and historical highs (~170). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (P33 order arrived P37). We select N=8 for demand parameters to capture the full extent of this active regime, smoothing the high variance (range 83-149) while excluding the pre-recovery crash data. High in-transit inventory (319) and current on-hand (166) provide a strong buffer against the documented volatility.

Carry-over insight: Volatile Moderate regime continues: P30-P37 average ~108 (range 83-149) reinforces the stability of this intermediate phase.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived P38). Demand in P38 dropped to 69, the lowest point in the current 'Volatile Moderate' regime, pulling the 5-period average down to ~92.8 units. The long-term historical high of ~170 is no longer relevant. Current pipeline + on-hand (509 units) provides decent coverage for a 5-period horizon at ~100 units/period demand, but volatility remains a risk. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the post-crash volatility (avg ~98) without over-weighting the single low data point of P38.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening within volatility: Period 38 demand of 69 is a new local low, pulling the 6-period moving average down to ~97.5 (from previous ~108). This suggests the 'Volatile Moderate' regime is trending downward.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand rebounded to 111 in Period 39 after a dip to 69 in P38, confirming the 'Volatile Moderate' regime is active and noisy. The 10-period average (P30-P39) is approx 104 units. With pipeline (410) slightly below 5-period coverage (~525), I am maintaining a recent-10 forecast to stabilize ordering against this moderate mean while holding sufficient safety stock for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P30-P39 average ~104 units (range 69-149) cements the 'Volatile Moderate' regime, replacing historical highs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 demand dropped to a historical low of 54, significantly dragging down the short-term average. The last 6 periods (P35-P40) now average ~88.5 units, a sharp decline from the previous 'Volatile Moderate' average of ~108. With a total pipeline of 497 units, inventory is currently sufficient to cover over 5 periods of demand at this deeper low level (expected ~450 units). I am switching to shorter-term parameters (N=6) to rapidly adjust the forecast downward and prevent overstocking during this slump, while maintaining the default lead time of 4 periods which remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Regime shift to 'Volatile Low' confirmed: Period 40 hit a historical low of 54 units. The 6-period average has dropped to ~88.5 (down from ~108), signaling a sustained downward trend in the volatility floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 demand (110 units) rebounded from the Period 40 low (54 units), confirming that the regime remains volatile rather than crashing completely. The 10-period average is approximately 95 units, significantly below the historical average of >170. We currently face a pipeline vulnerability for Period 45 due to a zero order in Period 41. To ensure service levels against this volatility and cover the incoming gap, I am using a 10-period moving average (recent_N=10) for both demand mean and variance. This smooths out the extreme single-period swings (54 to 110) while respecting the overall lower demand tier.

Carry-over insight: Regime 'Volatile Low' entrenched: P32-P41 avg ~95 (range 54-121 excluding outliers), replacing historical highs. High period-to-period volatility (sawtooth pattern) persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Current pipeline is 415 units (133 on-hand + 281 in-transit), with a small order (12) arriving this period and a larger replenishment (141) in Period 44. Demand analysis reveals a continued downward trend within the volatile regime: the P37-P42 average has dropped to ~91 units, compared to the P30-P36 average of ~108. Notably, both the volatility 'ceiling' (recent peaks declining 149 -> 121 -> 113 -> 110) and 'floor' (recent lows declining 89 -> 69 -> 54) are trending downward. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower average (~91) and the specific recent volatility profile (range 54-111). Default lead time (4) remains accurate.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed within Volatile Low regime: 6-period average dropped to ~91 (from ~108). Systematic decline observed in both local highs (149->110) and local lows (89->54 over P32-P42).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 44. Promised lead time is 4 periods, which is consistently observed in recent conclude messages (e.g., P39 order arrived P43). Demand has settled into a 'Volatile Low' regime (P38-P43) with an average of ~85 units and significant sawtooth volatility (alternating between ~60s and ~110s). The P43 demand of 63 reinforces this downward trend compared to the earlier ~100-120 range. Pipeline inventory is healthy: a large order (141 units from P40) arrives in P44, boosting on-hand (82) to safely cover immediate demand. We use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand estimates to capture this lower mean (~85) and current volatility without dragging in older high-demand data. Lead time remains set to default.

Carry-over insight: Volatile Low regime entrenched: P38-P43 average ~85 units (range 54-111). Pattern exhibits a sawtooth behavior, alternating between lows (~60s) and local highs (~100s), invalidating previous higher stable averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 analysis: The 'Volatile Low' regime persists (P38-P44 avg ~81 units, min 54, max 111). A 'sawtooth' pattern continues where low demands (<70) are often followed by rebounds (e.g., 54->110, 69->111). Period 44 demand (61) was low, and Period 43 (63) was also low, suggesting a potential rebound risk or sustained weakness. The historical high-demand context is long gone. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P40 order arrived P44). Given the holding cost ratio (0.8 critical ratio), we must avoid overstocking while covering the volatility. On-hand (162) + In-transit (249) = 411 total pipeline. With avg demand ~85, coverage is ~4.8 periods, which is close to the L+1 target (5 periods). I will set parameters based on the recent N=7 volatility to capture the full range of the current low but erratic regime (54-111).

Carry-over insight: Volatile Low regime persists: P38-P44 demand averages ~81 units with a range of 54-111, confirming a sustained departure from historical >100 norms.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46/50. Demand has exhibited a distinct stabilization at a lower level over the last 3 periods (P43-P45 range: 60-63 units), which is significantly below the local highs seen in P41-P42 (~100-110). This creates a 'Deep Stable Low' signal comparable to P28-P29, but sustained for longer. The 6-period average has dropped to ~75. Given the remaining horizon and the risk that this is a temporary lull before another volatility spike (as seen historically), I am using a 6-period window for parameters. This captures the recent low stability (weighting the forecast down) while retaining the memory of the ~100-unit spikes in the variance calculation to maintain an adequate safety stock buffer against potential resurgence.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized Low regime detected: P43-P45 demand consistent at ~61 average (range 60-63), marking a shift from the erratic 'Volatile Low' sawtooth pattern to a flat baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand has entered a highly stable 'Deep Low' regime over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), averaging ~61 units with minimal variance (range 60-63). This is distinct from the volatile sawtooth pattern seen in P30-P42. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to tightly track this new baseline (approx 61). However, acknowledging the recent history of spikes (e.g., P41=110, P42=101), I am setting sigma_hat with a slightly longer window (N=6) to retain awareness of that volatility risk, ensuring safety stock isn't eliminated entirely if the regime shifts back up. Current inventory position (169 on-hand + 190 in-transit) is robust against this low demand level.

Carry-over insight: Deep Low stability confirmed: P43-P46 demand averaged ~61 units with negligible variance, marking a distinct, stable floor below the previous volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized into a predictable 'Deep Low' regime (avg ~62, range 60-64) over the last 5 periods (P43-P47). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (191) and the end of the horizon approaching (Period 48/50), we adopt recent_N=5 parameters to tightly align supply with this low consumption rate and minimize ending inventory holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Deep Low regime fully stabilized: P43-P47 demand average ~62 units with minimal variance (range 60-64). This represents a highly predictable floor, significantly below the prior 'Volatile Low' average of ~85.

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 demand (75 units) significantly exceeded the previous stable range of 60-64 seen in Periods 43-47, signaling a potential end to the 'Deep Low' stability and a return of volatility or an upward trend. While on-hand inventory (151) is currently sufficient, the pipeline is relatively thin (87 units). I am switching parameters to use a 6-period recent history (N=6) for both demand and volatility. This incorporates the recent spike (increasing the baseline mean slightly to ~64 and widening the confidence interval) without completely discarding the established low baseline, ensuring a balanced reaction to the new signal. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Deep Low stability broken: Period 48 demand (75) exceeded the P43-P47 range (60-64), indicating a return of volatility or an upward trend.

chips(Regular): ordered=74, arrived=43 units (ordered on Period 45, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=194, demand=54, sold=54, ending on-hand inventory=140
Daily Profit: $216.00, Daily Holding Cost: $140.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 demand dropped back to 54 units, cancelling the potential upward trend signaled in Period 48 (75 units) and re-confirming the 'Volatile Low' regime or 'Deep Low' floor. The average over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is ~70 units, with a range of 54-110. The sustained low demand regime (P43-P49 avg ~62.5) suggests that holding too much stock is now a greater risk than stockouts, especially with 140 on-hand and 118 in-transit (Total = 258). This total covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the average rate of 62.5. We will stick to the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this stable low-demand shelf (P43-P49), ensuring the system doesn't over-order based on the distant past. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to P49 conclude (P45 order arrived P49).

Carry-over insight: Deep Low regime reaffirmed: After a brief spike in P48 (75), P49 demand (54) returned to the stable low baseline (P43-P49 avg ~62.5).
