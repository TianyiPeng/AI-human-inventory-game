Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No prior history or concluded periods exist yet. Product 'chips(Regular)' shows initial demand of 130 in the historical data (though this period's actual demand is yet to be realized in the simulation flow, I must plan based on available expected demand). The historical samples provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) show a downward trend. Given the high cost of stockouts relative to holding (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, ratio 4:1), I need to establish a safety stock. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since no actual lead time data exists, I will use the default promised lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will rely on the initial 5-period history provided in the constraints. The mean of the provided history (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) is 107.4. However, the last period dropped significantly to 71. Given this potential downward trend, a full average might overestimate, but 'recent_N' with a small N is safer than a long average. I will use recent_N=5 (the full history) for now to stabilize the start, noting the variance. OR logic will handle the standard deviation calculation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Current inventory is 0 with 145 units in transit (ordered P1). Demand in P1 was 107, which aligns closely with the historical average of ~107.4 derived from provided samples. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, accurate coverage requires accounting for L+1=5 periods of demand. The current pipeline (145) is insufficient to cover the 4-period lead time, implying inevitable stockouts in periods 2-4. I am using 'explicit' parameters derived from the historical mean (107) and standard deviation (~23) to rapidly correct the pipeline inventory deficit for future arrivals (targeting Period 6). Order quantity will be substantial to bridge the gap between current pipeline (145) and target base stock (~580).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 3. Observations show demand periods 1-2 were 107 and 149, while historical data (periods 1-5) shows 130, 122, 106, 108, 71. There is significant noise (range 71-149) but no confirmed trend yet. Promised lead time is 4. Since we are in Period 3, no orders have arrived yet (earliest possible arrival for a P1 order with L=4 is Period 5), so we cannot infer actual lead time; we default to promised (L=4). For demand, recent samples (P1:107, P2:149) are slightly higher/volatile than the provided historical mean, but 'recent_N' with N=5 (using history + current observed) provides a stable estimate without overhyping the small sample size of 2 observed periods. We use the last 5 available data points from the provided 'history' block as the most reliable baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4. No inventory is on hand, and sales have been lost in periods 1-3. Total in-transit (444 units) covers ~3.8 periods of average demand (117.3), which is below the target coverage for L+1=5 periods. Observed demand (107, 149, 96) is volatile but averages similarly to the provided historical samples (avg ~119). Since promised lead time is 4, the first order from P1 is expected to arrive in P5; no arrivals are expected yet, so L remains default. We use recent_N=3 for demand parameters to align with the erratic but established current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 5. Pipeline inventory is 608 units, which is substantial. Promised lead time is 4 periods; orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (observable in Period 6 conclude), so 'arrived=0' in history is normal and consistent. Demand has been volatile (107 -> 149 -> 96 -> 92). The recent dip in periods 3 and 4 suggests a cooling trend, but with only 2 periods of evidence, it is not yet a confirmed regime shift. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the average of the full available history (N=4) to smooth the Period 2 spike while acknowledging the recent lower demand, rather than reacting aggressively to the dip. This ensures sufficient safety stock against volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. First shipment arrived in Period 5, confirming actual lead time matches promised lead time (4 periods). Current Net Inventory Position is 20 (on-hand) + 463 (in-transit) = 483. Observed demand average over 5 periods is ~113.8 with high volatility (std dev ~23.5). Target inventory for 5 periods (L+1) should be approx 114 * 5 + safety stock, roughly 615+. The current position (483) is below target, necessitating a replenishment order. Using recent_N=5 for demand parameters to rely strictly on the observed Game History rather than pre-game priors.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7. Confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 2 order arriving in Period 6 verified this). In-transit inventory (449 units) perfectly matches the sum of outstanding orders from periods 3, 4, 5, and 6 (154+164+0+131=449), indicating no lost shipments. Demand shows high variance (ranging from 92 to 149) with no clear trend or seasoning yet; average is approx 112. Given current volatility and high profit margin (critical fractile 0.8), using the full historical dataset ('default') allows the backend to calculate a robust safety stock based on the true observed standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 8. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7), matching the promised lead time. I am setting L using recent_N=3 to reflect these specific confirmed arrivals. Demand over P1-P7 averages 111 units but exhibits volatility (Period 2 spike to 149), with a standard deviation approx 20. Given the high critical ratio (0.8) from favorable margins ($4 profit vs $1 holding), service level protection is priority. I am using recent_N=7 for demand parameters to include the full history\u2014specifically the variance from Period 2\u2014to ensure the safety stock buffer is sufficient for the 5-period risk horizon (Review+Lead). Current inventory position of 482 (111 on-hand + 371 in-transit) is below the estimated target (~590), triggering a replenishment order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (orders placed P1-P4 arrived exactly on time in P5-P8). Demand remains volatile (range 86-149) but stable around a mean of ~108 over the last 8 periods. With current pipeline (507) vs target (~540+safety), system should restock. Using recent_N=8 for demand parameters incorporates the full realized history to smooth the variance while capturing the P2 and P5 spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Current Period 10. Demand in P8 and P9 has trended downward (86, 76). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on all observed arrivals (P5 through P8 conclusions). Order from Period 5 was 0, explaining the 0 arrivals in Period 9. We use 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the recent mean of approx 99 units, which is slightly lower than the all-time average, reflecting the recent cooling trend while smoothing out the noise of the last two very low periods.

Period 11. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 10 arrival from Period 6 order). All pipeline orders are accounted for; in-transit of 287 matches orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. Demand averages ~107 over the last 10 periods but is highly volatile (ranging 76-149). Current on-hand (108) plus expected arrival from P7 order (76) provides ~184 units coverage, sufficient for max observed demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision. Reviewing history: Lead time is consistently delivering at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12). Note that the order from Period 5 (quantity 0) did arrive in Period 9 effectively, but since size was 0, it doesn't show as 'arrived=X'. The gap between arriving orders (P4->P8 arrived, then gap in P9, then P6->P10 arrived) aligns with the fact that Period 5 order was 0. Demand history shows relatively stable oscillation around 100-110 units (Recent samples: 125, 101, 107, 86, 76, 136, 123, 104). Mean of all valid historical demand samples (approx 107) is a good estimator. No strong trend or changepoint is detected recently requiring a short memory window, so using a broader averaging window ('default' which uses all samples) provides stability against noise like the spike to 136 or dip to 76. Lead time remains stable at L=4. We will stick to 'default' parameters to maintain the current effective service level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 14. Analyzing demand history (P4-P13), the average is approx. 101 units, though volatility is high (ranging from 63 to 136 recently). The dip in P13 (63 units) pulls a short average down, so I will likely use N=10 to maintain a robust forecast of ~100 units/period and avoid under-stocking. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by P9 order arriving P13). On-hand (76) plus in-transit (442) = 518, which covers the expected demand for the review horizon (L+1=5 periods -> ~500 units) plus safety stock. OR parameters are set to stabilize ordering.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Lead time consistently stable at 4 periods in recent history. Demand is noisy but stationary around mean ~103. Current IP (463) is slightly low for a 5-period horizon (L+1=5). Using recent_N=10 for demand to capture recent volatility without overreacting to single period noise.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Inventory is 61, Pipeline is 384 (matches pending orders from P12-P15: 147+120+32+85=384). No explicit lost orders detected. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (promised), as confirmed by arrivals up to Period 15. Demand history shows high volatility (range 63-149) with a recent slight softening, though Period 15 rebounded to 103. I will use 'recent_N' (N=10) for mu_hat to average out the noise while staying responsive to the broader trend (~99 units). I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to include the full history of high volatility in the safety stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $682.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. The system continues to show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods, confirmed consistently in recent conclusions (P12 order arriving P16, P11 arriving P15). Demand has shown significant volatility recently, with a sharp spike to 178 in Period 16, which is well above the previous range (60-130). Previous demand was relatively stable or slightly declining (63 in P13, 87 in P14, 103 in P15). This sudden jump to 178 suggests a possible new high-demand regime or a one-off outlier. Given the cost ratio (Profit $4/Holding $1 => 0.8 critical ratio), we want to avoid stockouts. A purely 'default' average (calculated over all 16 periods) would dampen this recent signal too much. A 'recent_N' approach with a small N (e.g., 5) captures the recent volatility better without overreacting to a single point. I will use recent_5 for demand parameters to stay responsive to the apparent upward shift while waiting to see if it sustains. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16: 178 units vs prior avg ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $600.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 demand (222) confirms the spike seen in Period 16 (178) is a sustained regime shift, doubling the historical baseline of ~100. We are significantly understocked (0 on-hand) with demand far exceeding supply. Switching Mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=2 to rapidly align the forecast with the new ~200 unit/period level. Setting Sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the transition volatility and increase safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed P16-P17: avg surged to 200 vs historical ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19. Demand in Period 18 was 146 units, confirming the high-demand regime (P16-P18 avg ~182) relative to the historical baseline of ~100, despite a drop from the P17 peak. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P18 conclude confirmed 4). In-transit inventory (652 units) matches exactly the sum of orders from P15-P18, so no shipments are lost. To maintain service levels in this elevated, volatile regime, we switch parameters to rely strictly on the last 3 periods of data.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists: P16-P18 avg ~182 units (vs pre-spike ~100). Volatility is high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: Demand regime shift identified in Period 16 is now sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19 avg ~175 units vs historic ~100). Recent demand values (178, 222, 146, 155) indicate a higher mean and volatility. To adapt, we switch estimators to 'recent_N' with N=4, discarding pre-shift data to avoid under-forecasting. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory is 0 with significant pipeline, so accurate forecasting is critical to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained (4 periods, avg ~175 units). Volatility increased.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Demand in Period 20 dropped significantly to 98, deviating from the 'high regime' average of ~175 observed in Periods 16-19. This could signal a reversion to the historical baseline (~100), or simply high volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, critical fractile 0.8), avoiding stockouts is prioritized over holding cost minimization. We use 'recent_N=5' for demand and volatility to blend the recent spike with the new lower observation, resulting in a forecast of ~160. This provides a buffer if the drop is an outlier, while acknowledging the downward signal. The pipeline (851 units) is robust due to previous reactive ordering, likely covering demand for the full lead time (average coverage ~5.3 periods at 160/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $682.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand (172) signals a return to the high-demand regime, confirming that Period 20 (98) was likely a transient dip rather than a reversion to historical means. The new regime (Period 16 onwards) has an average demand of ~162 units and high volatility, significantly above the pre-P16 average of ~100. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (Period 17 order arrived in Period 21). Current inventory position (713 units) covers roughly 4.4 periods of demand, which is tight given the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I am setting demand parameters using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to exclusively capture the characteristics of this high-volatility post-shift regime.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed persistent by Period 21 (172 units) following Period 20 dip; P16-P21 average is ~162 units with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand (146) reinforces the high-demand regime established since Period 16. While there is significant volatility (ranging from 98 to 222), the 7-period average (P16-P22) remains approximately 160 units, significantly above the historical ~100 baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods with no missing shipments. We select N=7 for both mean and volatility to capture the full extent of this new regime, smoothing out the dip in P20 while retaining the high peaks of P16/P17 to ensure adequate safety stock given the high profit margin.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P22: Average ~160 units with high volatility (range 98-222). Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. A high-demand regime has been active since Period 16. Demand in Period 23 (164 units) aligns with the regime average of ~160 units (P16-P23). Volatility remains high, with demand fluctuating between 98 and 222 in this window. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (promised = observed). In-transit inventory (465 units) matches the sum of pending orders from P20-P23 exactly, confirming no lost shipments. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we maintain a robust service level by using 'recent_N' with N=8 for both demand mean and volatility. This window (P16-P23) captures the entire high-demand regime history, ensuring the forecast reflects the true elevated average (~160) rather than recent fluctuations, maximizing protection against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P23: Avg ~160 units (range 98-222). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 continues. Using the full history of this regime (last 9 periods, P16-P24), the average demand is ~156 units with high volatility (range 98-222). Although the last 5 periods show a slightly lower average (~141), we select N=9 to maintain a robust buffer against the high variance and the high cost of stockouts (CR=0.8). Lead time performance remains strictly consistent with the promised 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P24: Avg ~156 units with significant volatility. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High demand regime persists since Period 16 (avg ~152), though recent periods (P24-P25) show slight cooling to ~118. Given the high volatility (range 98-222), we stick to a 10-period rolling window to capture the full regime profile and avoid under-reacting to a potential resurgence. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P25: Avg ~152 units, though cooling slightly in P24-P25. Volatility remains relevant. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27. Pipeline integrity confirmed: expected in-transit (P23-P26 orders: 128+162+104+91=485) matches actual (485). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Demand in Period 26 (144) rebounded from the slight dip in P25 (112), confirming the high-demand regime is still active but moderating slightly. The 5-period (P22-P26) average is ~138 units, while the 10-period (P17-P26) average is ~148 units. Given the high cost of understocking (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I select N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the broader volatility and higher average of the post-shift regime to maintain a safer buffer stock, rather than reacting too sharply to the recent cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P26: 10-period avg ~148 units (moderating from peak but well above historical ~100). Volatility remains high.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: The high demand regime (initiated at Period 16) continues, with Period 27 showing a strong rebound to 181 units after a brief lull. This confirms the volatility inherent in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (orders consistently arrive on time). We select 'recent_N' with N=12 for both mu and sigma to utilize the full history of this high-demand regime (Periods 16-27). This window captures both the peaks (222) and troughs (98), ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the true volatility to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P27: Average ~154 units with high volatility (range 98-222). P27 demand (181) confirms regime persistence. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 30. We are in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand has recently intensified again (P27-P29 avg ~189) after a brief dip in P24-P26 (avg ~127). Promised lead time (4 periods) matches actual observed lead times (e.g., P25 order arrived P29). With current on-hand inventory critically low (23 units) and incoming orders for P30/P31 likely insufficient to cover the ~165-189 unit demand, stockouts are imminent. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent upward trend (avg ~165) rather than the lower 10-period average. This aggressively raises the base stock target to replenish the pipeline and stabilize service levels for future periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16+) sustained. Recent demand surge P27-P29 (avg ~189) suggests an intensification within the regime compared to P24-P26 (avg ~127). Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 Observation: Demand in Period 30 was 127 units, resulting in a stockout (114 units sold, 0 ending on-hand). The previous surge (P27-P29) averaged ~189 units, indicating high volatility within this elevated regime. The overall regime (P16-P30) shows a mean demand of ~157 units, significantly higher than the early history (~107). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 26 order arrived P30). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a critical need to cover demand variability, I will continue using the recent_N method to capture the elevated mean and high standard deviation from this specific high-demand regime (last 15 periods cover the start of the spike at P16 to present).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P30: Avg ~157 units (peaks >200, lows ~98). Volatility remains high, causing stockouts despite high ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $500.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. We are in a stockout position (0 on-hand) following consecutive stockouts in P30 and P31, though a large volume (726 units) is in transit. The high-demand regime starting Period 16 persists, characterized by a mean around 157 and high volatility. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (Order from P27 arrived in P31). For mu_hat, we use a shorter window (N=6, avg ~164) to capture the elevated demand in recent periods (P27-P29 spikes) compared to the long-term regime average (~156), aiming to recover inventory levels. For sigma_hat, we use the full regime history (N=16) to ensure safety stock accounts for the maximum volatility observed (peaks up to 222) since the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P31: Avg ~157 units. Variance remains high (range 98-222), causing recent stockouts in P30-P31.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. The high demand regime (begun P16) continues with significant volatility. P33 demand rebounded to 198 units after a brief lull, reconfirming that the demand distribution is wide (range 98-222) with an average of ~157 units over the regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P29 order of 218 units arrived fully in P33). We maintain parameters based on the post-shift history (N=18 samples from P16-P33) to ensure the Base Stock and Cap calculations reflect the true 157-unit average and high standard deviation, which is critical to preventing stockouts given the 0.8 critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained P16-P33: Avg ~157 units. P33 demand (198) confirms persistent high volatility (range 98-222) requiring robust safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 saw a massive outlier drop in demand to 46 units (lowest on record), contrasting with the sustained high regime (avg ~160). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. While P36 could be an anomaly, prudence dictates incorporating it into the forecast without overreacting. I am switching to recent_N=5 for demand and volatility. This lowers the mean forecast to ~141 (from ~160) but significantly increases volatility/safety stock, balancing the risk of a demand crash against the risk of stockouts if usage rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Extreme demand drop to 46 units observed, breaking the consistent high-volume pattern (avg ~160) seen since P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: Demand in P36 (46) and P37 (95) indicates a sharp departure from the previous high-volume regime (avg ~160). This suggests the high season (P16-P35) has ended or entered a volatile cooling phase. Given the high underage cost (profit $4 vs holding $1), we avoid reacting too aggressively to the drop by using a 5-period window. This blends recent lows with the tail of the high season (avg ~131) to 'soft land' the inventory target rather than crashing it, while the high standard deviation from recent volatility maintains a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift observed P36-P37: Avg ~70 units vs prior ~160. High-volume season likely ending.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand (111 units) confirms the end of the high-demand regime (which averaged ~160 units). The most recent 3 periods (P36-P38) average 84 units, significantly lower than the peak season, though recovering slightly from the P36 low (46 units) towards historical normals (~110). Current system inventory (On-hand 282 + In-transit 379 = 661) is very high relative to this reduced demand. I am switching to N=3 for both mu and sigma to rapidly adapt the base stock downwards and prevent further over-ordering while working through excess inventory. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand normalization confirmed P36-P38: Avg ~84 units, suggesting return to historical levels (~100-110) after peak season. System currently overstocked.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has effectively returned to historical baseline levels (~100 units/period) following the high-demand season. The last 4 periods (P36-P39) show an average demand of ~86 units, fluctuating around the 90-110 range after the P36 dip. With a total inventory position of 568 units (331 on-hand + 237 in-transit) against a 5-period expected demand of roughly 500 units, the system is overstocked. I am using recent_N=4 to tightly align the base stock parameters with this lower, stabilized demand regime and minimize holding costs while the excess inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P37-P39 average is ~100 units, solidly replacing the previous high-demand regime (~160+).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: We are in a confirmed low-demand regime (post-peak) with demand stabilizing around 100 units (P37-P40 avg ~100). The current on-hand inventory (428 units) is excessive relative to this demand level, providing over 4 periods of coverage. The priority is to deplete this excess deeply to reduce holding costs. Applying 'recent_N' with N=5 (P36-P40) captures the drop and the current stability (avg ~89 due to P36 outlier), yielding a lower Base Stock that discourages ordering and facilitates destocking. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 Observation: Demand in Period 41 was 84 units, reinforcing the lower demand regime observed since Period 36. The average demand for the post-peak regime (P36-P41) is approximately 88 units. This is a significant drop from the peak season average (~160). As confirmed in Period 40, the system is currently overstocked (On-hand 344 + In-transit 65 = 409) against this lower demand level (expected demand ~90 * 5 periods = 450). We are gradually burning down inventory. I will maintain parameters aligned with this normalized regime (P36-present) to prevent over-ordering while ensuring we don't stock out as inventory normalizes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by P36 order arriving P40).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed P36-P41: Avg ~88 units, consistent with pre-peak historical levels. High inventory burn-down phase active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. The high-demand season (Period 16-35) is definitively over. Current demand has stabilized back to pre-peak levels, averaging ~85 units over the last 6 periods (P37-P42: 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66). This confirms a return to the historical baseline of ~100 or slightly lower. We are currently significantly overstocked (On-hand: 318) due to late arrivals of peak-season orders combining with the sudden demand drop. The pipeline (100 in-transit) plus on-hand (318) totals 418 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand (at ~85/period). We need to burn down this inventory. I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to reflect the stabilized low demand (approx avg 91.5). I will use default sigma calculation to account for recent variance but keep it grounded. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed P37-P42: Avg ~91.5 units, significantly lower than peak regime (~160). Inventory burn-down is the priority.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: We are firmly in a post-peak, low-demand regime. Since the crash in Period 36, average demand (P36-P43) has dropped to ~82 units, with the most recent two periods (P42, P43) averaging even lower (~63.5 units). This is a stark contrast to the prior peak of ~160. Inventory is being burned down, though the system placed a significant order in P43. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 472 units. With a 5-period horizon (L=4 + 1), expected demand is ~410 units. The current position is sufficient. I will set parameters using the last 8 observations (since the regime shift at P36) to align the base stock with this lower demand reality and prevent overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime sustained P36-P43: Avg ~82 units. Recent periods P42-P43 show further softening to ~63.5 avg, well below historical norms.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. We are now 9 periods into the post-peak regime (P36-P44), with an average demand of ~83 units and moderate volatility. This is significantly lower than the peak season (~160) and slightly below the early historical baseline (~100-110). Inventory burn-down has been successful; total pipeline plus on-hand (167+215=382) is now aligning with the 5-period coverage needed (approx 5 * 83 = 415). We resume regular ordering parameters based solely on this recent 'low/normal' regime to prevent undershooting as the burn-down completes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed sustained P36-P44: Average ~83 units. The market has fully stabilized at this lower level following the mid-year peak, with recent volatility (P42-P44) showing a range of 61-90 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 represents the final opportunity to order stock that will arrive within the simulation horizon (arriving in Period 50). The 'low' demand regime initiated in Period 36 has stabilized over the last 10 periods with an average of ~85 units, though recent periods P44-P45 show a recovery trend (avg 95) closer to the historical norm of 100. Inventory (92 units) is low, and the pipeline (262 units) must cover demand until the current order arrives. Given the Profit/Holding ratio (4:1), avoiding stockouts in the final periods is critical. I am using recent_N=10 to capture the full statistics of the post-crash regime (P36-P45) to set the final target level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed P36-P45: avg ~85 units. Recent uptick P44-P45 (avg 95) suggests possible return to initial historical norms (~100). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
High-demand season has ended. Current demand P37-P46 averages ~85 units, with recent dip to 53 in P46. Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods (P42 order arrived P46). Using recent_N=10 for demand parameters to reflect this stabilized post-peak baseline (avg ~85) and discard the irrelevant high volume data from before P37.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed P37-P46: Avg ~85.3 units. Recent dip to 53 in P46 highlights ongoing volatility even in lower volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 Context: Demand remains in the low/stabilized regime (P36-P47 avg ~83.5), significantly below the mid-year peak (~160). Recent periods show volatility within this lower range (P46: 53, P47: 81), but the overall trend is consistent with historical off-peak levels (~100). 

Inventory Status: On-hand is 148 units, with 234 units in-transit. Total pipeline = 382. 
Expected coverage: With average demand ~85-90, 382 units covers approx 4+ periods. The system is recovering from overstock but still has healthy coverage.

Lead Time Analysis: Orders consistently arrive in 4 periods (confirmed again in P47 conclude: order from P43 arrived). No evidence of drift or loss.

Parameter Strategy: 
1. Lead Time: Keep default (4 periods) as performance is stable.
2. Demand (mu_hat): Use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the sustained lower regime (P38-P47) while smoothing out the extreme dip in P46 and P36. The average of last 10 periods is approx 84, which aligns well with the stabilized state.
3. Volatility (sigma_hat): Use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the volatility of this specific low-demand period (range 53-111).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed sustained P36-P47: Avg ~83.5 units. Volatility persists (low of 53 in P46), but levels remain distinct from the peak season (~160).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 49. The low demand regime marked by the end of the peak season (post-P36) continues. Over the last 12 periods (P37-P48), demand has averaged approximately 84.5 units with moderate volatility (range 53-111). While the most recent 5 periods average slightly lower (~81 units), utilizing a 12-period window provides a robust estimate that smooths out short-term fluctuations like the dip in P46 (53) and minimizes stockout risk given the high service level target (critical ratio 0.8). Lead times remain stable at the promised 4 periods. With pipeline inventory at 375 and expected lead-time demand around 425 (5 periods * 85), parameters are set to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime sustained P36-P48: Avg ~84 units. Demand appears stable in the 80-85 range, significantly below the mid-year peak (~160).

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 observation confirms the low-demand regime (avg ~83 units since P36) is stable, with P49 demand at 89 units. The most recent lead time confirmation (P45 order arrived P49) confirms a stable 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently low (51 units), but significant pipeline inventory exists (316 units). With a service level target of ~80% (Profit 4/Holding 1), we continue to order based on the stabilized post-peak demand. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire low-demand period (P40-P49) while excluding the previous high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime sustained P36-P49: Avg ~83 units. Regime remains stable with volatility (53-100 range). Lead time consistent at 4 periods.
