  "rationale": "We are in Period 1/50 for 'chips(Regular)'. \n\n1. **Demand Analysis**: No live usage history exists yet. We have a list of historical samples: [122, 121, 60, 83, 105]. The average of these samples is 98.2. The max is 122. There is significant variance (from 60 to 122). Given the 4:1 Profit-to-Holding cost ratio ($4 profit, $1 holding), the cost of stocking out is much higher than holding inventory, justifying a target closer to the maximum historical demand rather than the mean.\n\n2. **Lead Time & Pipeline**: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is Period 1, we haven't placed any orders yet, so the pipeline (In-transit) is 0. With a lead time of 4, an order placed now will arrive in Period 5 (Period 1 + 4 = 5) to satisfy demand. However, we also need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, Period 3, Period 4, and Period 5 (start). Wait, lead time logic: Order P1 -> Arrives during P5. That means we need coverage for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. Actually, usually logic is focusing on strict coverage. Let's aim to fill the pipeline to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods).\n\n3. **Inventory State**: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 0.\n\n4. **Order Calculation**: Target Stock Level for approximately 5 periods (Lead Time 4 + Current Period 1). Choosing a safety-conscious daily demand estimate of ~115 (biased towards upper end of history due to stockout cost). \nTarget Inventory = 115 units/period * 5 periods = 575 units.\nCurrent Inventory Position (On-hand + In-transit) = 0.\nOrder Quantity = 575 - 0 = 575.\n\nGiven the variability in history (low of 60), 575 is aggressive but necessary to kickstart the pipeline given the 0 starting stock and long lead time.",

  "rationale": "We are in Period 2. The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. \n\n**Demand Analysis:** \nHistorical samples provided in the prompt show Period 1=122, Period 2=121, Period 3=60. The actual game history for Period 1 shows demand=118. This aligns closely with the sample Period 1 (122). Demand seems stable around ~120 units initially but samples suggest a potential drop in Period 3. Let's assume a baseline demand of roughly 120 for now, but be cautious of the drop seen in the samples. \n\n**Inventory & Pipeline:** \n- On-hand: 0\n- In-transit: 575 (Ordered in P1).\n- Promised Lead Time: 4. \n- Order placed in P1 arrives in P1+4=P5. Visible in P6 report. \n- Order placed in P2 arrives in P2+4=P6. Visible in P7 report.\n\n**Pipeline Coverage:** \nThe pipeline of 575 units is expected to arrive in Period 5. Until then, we have 0 stock. This means we will stock out for Periods 2, 3, and 4. \nWe need to cover demand for the period *after* my P1 order arrives to maintain continuity. \n\nTarget Position Calculation (Standard Base Stock Policy): \nTarget Level = Demand_Avg * (Lead_Time + 1 + Safety_Stock_Factor)\nWith L=4, we need coverage for current Period 2 + 4 future periods = 5 periods total. \nHowever, since my P1 order (575) covers roughly 575/120 \u2248 4.8 periods of demand, it effectively covers P5, P6, P7, P8, and most of P9 (assuming it arrives on time). \nWait, if I order now (P2), it arrives in P6. The P1 order arrives in P5. \nSo, P1 order covers demand for P5, P6, P7... \n575 units / 120 demand/period \u2248 4.8 periods. \nThis single order is massive. It covers almost 5 periods of demand. \nThe P1 order (575) will replenish stock in Period 5. \nI need stock for Period 6 onwards (when the P2 order would arrive). \n\nLet's re-evaluate coverage: \nExpected Arrival P5: 575. \nIf demand is ~120: \nP5 demand = 120 (remaining 455) \nP6 demand = 120 (remaining 335) \nP7 demand = 120 (remaining 215) \nP8 demand = 120 (remaining 95) \nP9 demand = 120 (stockout) \n\nMy order today (P2) arrives in Period 6. It needs to pick up where P1 left off? No, P1 order covers P5 onwards. \nActually, the P1 order is exceptionally large (nearly 5x average demand). \nWe have 575 units coming in P5. \nIf I order today (P2), it arrives in P6. \nAt start of P6, expected inventory from P1 order = 575 - (Demand P5). \nApprox 455 units. \nThis is plenty to cover P6 and several periods after. \n\nGiven the massive holding cost risk ($1/unit) and the large initial order relative to demand (575 vs ~120), placing another order now would likely result in overstocking when the pipeline eventually clears. The P1 order seems designed to cover the 'startup' pipeline fill. \n\nI will place a small order or 0 to avoid holding costs, as 575 in transit covers almost 5 periods of demand once it arrives. Actually, to be safe against lead time variability or higher demand, maybe a small top-up, but 575 is huge. It's nearly equal to the sum of demand for P1-P5 in the sample data (122+121+60+83+105 = 491). \nWait, the sample data sums to 491 for 5 periods. 575 is enough to cover the entire sample duration if it arrived instantly. Since it arrives in P5, it covers P5 onwards for a long time. \nIt is safer to order 0 and wait for the pipeline to resolve closer to arrival.",

  "rationale": "We are in Period 3. \n\n1. **Demand Analysis**: Historical samples showed periods 1-5 demand as [122, 121, 60, 83, 105] (avg ~98). However, actual game history shows demand in Period 1 was 118 and Period 2 was 155. This average (136.5) is higher than the historical samples provided in the setup instructions. The high holding cost ($1.00) vs profit ($4.00) suggests we should avoid huge overstock, but the stockouts in P1 and P2 represent significant lost profit. Forecast: Conservative estimate around 135-140 based on recent actuals.\n\n2. **Lead Time & Pipeline**: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Order made in P1 (575 units) should arrive during P5 (P1+4) and be usable in P6, or perhaps during P4 if L=3? Standard logic: Order P1 -> Arrives P5 -> Visible P6. The instructions say 'Order arrives during Period (N+L)'s arrival resolution'. So if L=4, P1 order arrives in P5. Until then, we have 0 stock. Wait, if L=4, P1 order arrives in P5. P2 order arrives P6. P3 order (now) arrives P7. We are in a deep hole. Total In-transit is 575. We have 0 on hand.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand: 0. In-transit: 575. The 575 ordered in P1 covers roughly 4 periods of demand (575/140 \u2248 4.1). This covers demand until roughly Period 5 or 6 once it arrives. \n\n4. **Order Decision**: We need to cover demand for the period when the *current* order arrives. Order placed in P3 arrives in P7 (assuming L=4). We need to cover P7, plus perhaps a buffer for P8. \n\nThe P1 order (575) covers the backlog if it arrived earlier, but since stock is non-backlogged (lost sales), it will simply become inventory. Since we stocked out P1 and P2, the 575 will arrive in P5 (or P4?) and provide ~4 periods of coverage (P5, P6, P7, P8). \n\nLet's re-evaluate coverage:\n- P1 order (575) arrives P5. Available on hand for P5 demand.\n- Coverage of P1 order: P5 (140), P6 (140), P7 (140), P8 (140) = 560. So the 575 covers us through P8 roughly.\n- Therefore, for the P3 order (arriving P7), we might be double-ordering if the P1 order covers P7. The P1 order arrives P5. It covers P5, P6, P7, and part of P8. \n- An order placed NOW (P3) arrives P7. If P1 order covers P7 demand, we only need to order enough to top up P8 or start covering P8.\n\nWait, 'Arrives during Period N+L'. If L=4:\n- P1 order arrives P5.\n- P3 order arrives P7.\n\nInventory logic:\n- P5 Start: 575 arrives. Demand P5 (~140). End P5: 435.\n- P6 Start: 435. Demand P6 (~140). End P6: 295.\n- P7 Start: 295 + (P3 order arrives). Demand P7 (~140). End P7: 155 + Order.\n\nWe don't need the P3 order to arrive for P7 satisfaction, as we still have ~295 units from the P1 order entering P7. We likely have stock through P8 (End P8: 155 - 140 = 15). \n\nHowever, standard base stock for L=4 usually targets covering L+1 periods. Target inventory = (4+1) * 140 = 700. Current IP = 0 + 575 = 575. Gap = 125. \nGiven the high holding cost and the potential that the historical samples (with lower vals 60, 83) might manifest, sticking closer to the conservative side is wise. But we are currently stocking out. Let's add a small amount to bridge the gap and ensure coverage into P8/P9.\n\nLet's order to bring IP closer to 700. 700 - 575 = 125. This covers roughly one period of demand.",

  "rationale": "World Knowledge & Product: 'chips(Regular)' is a non-perishable snack. No specific date or seasonality is provided beyond generic 'Period 5'.\n\nDemand Analysis: Historical sample means were around 98 (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). Observed demand in P1-P4: 118, 155, 128, 117. The average over P1-P4 is ~129.5, which is significantly higher than the provided historical samples. This confirms a sustained higher demand regime compared to the sample data. P2 was particularly high (155), but P3 and P4 settled back near 120-130 range. I will forecast around 130 for future demand.\n\nLead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 4. An order placed in P1 should arrive during P5 (concluded/visible in P6). Currently, no orders have arrived yet (P1-P4 conclude messages show arrived=0). The total in-transit is 700 (575 from P1 + 125 from P3). The P1 order of 575 is expected to arrive *during* this period (Period 5). We are operating blindly until P6 starts and we see P5's conclude message.\n\nInventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 700. We expect the 575 to arrive this period (P5). If it arrives, on-hand becomes 575. Demand for P5 is ~130. Ending P5 inventory would be ~445. The P3 order (125) arrives in P7 (P3 + 4). \n\nTarget Inventory Calculation: We need coverage for Lead Time + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 periods. \nTarget Level = Forecast * (5) + Safety Stock. \nReview period: 1 period. Lead time: 4 periods. Exposure: 5 periods.\nAvg Demand ~ 130.\nTarget = 130 * 5 = 650.\nMaybe slight safety stock due to P2 spike (155). Let's aim for ~700 coverage.\n\nCurrent Position: On-hand (0) + In-transit (700) = 700.\nThis theoretically covers demand for P5, P6, P7, P8, P9. \nWait, let's trace exactly:\nP5 consumption: ~130 (Remaining Pipeline: 570)\nP6 consumption: ~130 (Remaining Pipeline: 440)\nP7 consumption: ~130 (Remaining Pipeline: 310)\nP8 consumption: ~130 (Remaining Pipeline: 180)\nP9 consumption: ~130 (Remaining Pipeline: 50)\n\nThe current pipeline of 700 covers roughly 5.4 periods of demand (700/130). Since the lead time is long (4 periods), we are making decisions for arrival in P9 (Order P5 -> Arrive P9). \nWe need to ensure we have stock for P9. P5, P6, P7, P8 demand = ~520. Remaining from current 700 would be 180. That covers P9. However, we want to maintain a buffer.\n\nLet's re-calculate more strictly:\nTarget Position (Base Stock) = (L+1) * AvgDemand + SafetyStock\nL=4. Review=1. L+R = 5 periods.\nDemand ~ 130.\nStdDev of P1-P4 is approx 16. Service Level ~95% (Profit 4 vs Cost 1 is high ratio, favoring stock).\nz=1.65. Safety Stock = 1.65 * 16 * sqrt(5) \u2248 60.\nTarget = 5 * 130 + 60 = 650 + 60 = 710.\nCurrent Position = 700. \nDeficit = 710 - 700 = 10 units.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider that the P1 order (575) was a huge bulk order intended to seed the pipeline. P3 order was small (125). We skipped ordering in P2 and P4. The pipeline is effectively draining relative to the initial seed. To maintain the flow, we should start placing regular replacement orders closer to the mean demand.\nIf I order 130 (replacement) now, my position goes to 830, which is plenty secure (6.3 periods). \nIf I order 0, I stay at 700, which is just at the target. \nGiven the high holding cost ($1 per unit is 25% of profit margin) relative to margin, we should be careful not to overstock. The optimal service level is Critical Ratio = 4 / (4+1) = 0.80. This suggests we don't need excessive safety stock. \nA target of roughly average demand coverage is sufficient. 700 units covers >5 periods. No order needed, or a very small one to top up.\nI will place a small order to smooth the pipeline arrivals for P9, rather than relying on the large chunks, but since inventory is costly, I'll stick to 0 or very low. Actually, looking at the gaps: P1(575) arrives P5. P3(125) arrives P7. P6 will rely on the P1 leftovers. P8 will rely on leftovers. P9 needs stock. \nThe 575 arriving now covers P5, P6, P7, P8 roughly (4 * 130 = 520). By P9 (when today's order arrives), we will run out if demand is slightly higher. \nLet's order close to mean demand to fill the P9 bucket. Forecast 130. Position 700. Expected usage over next 4 periods (P5,6,7,8) is 520. 700 - 520 + Order_P5 = Stock_P9_start. 180 + Order_P5. 180 is enough for P9. So strictly, no order is mandatory. \nHowever, a small top-up prevents a stock out if demand spikes to 155 again multiple times. I'll order 50 to maintain a buffer without bloating holding costs.",

P1-P4 averaged ~129.5. P5-P6 stabilized at 98 (matching historical average). \n    - **Critical Observation:** Period 7 demand dropped sharply to 47. This is significantly lower than even the 'low' historical sample of 60. It suggests either a new low regime, a one-off outlier, or a stockout (though we had plenty of stock, so it was genuine low demand).\n    - Forecast strategy: Given P5-P6 were 98 and P7 was 47, I will be conservative. I will weight recent observations heavily. A blend of P5-P7 (98, 98, 47) suggests an average around ~81. To be safe, I'll forecast around ~95 (assuming 47 was an anomaly, but respecting the softening trend).\n\n2.  **Lead Time & Pipeline:** \n    - Promised lead time: 4 periods.\n    - Verified lead time: P1 order arrived P5 (4 periods). P3 order arrived P7 (4 periods). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.\n    - Pipeline: \n        - P4 order (0) arrives P8.\n        - P5 order (50) arrives P9.\n        - P6 order (100) arrives P10.\n        - P7 order (35) arrives P11.\n    - Total In-transit: 185 units.\n\n3.  **Inventory Position:** \n    - Current On-hand: 457 units.\n    - Total Inventory Position (On-hand + In-transit) = 642 units.\n    - Coverage needs (target L+1 = 5 periods). \n    - Target Level: With a forecast of ~95, 5 periods demand = 475 units. Plus safety stock (for variance like P2's 155), perhaps target ~550-600.\n\n4.  **Order Decision:** \n    - Current position (642) > Target (approx 550-600).\n    - We are significantly overstocked due to the sudden demand drop in P7 and the heavy initial ordering.

Based on the current observation and history for Period 14:

### Rationale

**1. Demand Analysis & Volatility**
- **Recent Rhythm:** We see a distinct "sawtooth" or alternating volatility pattern recently:
  - Period 9: 123 (High)
  - Period 10: 92 (Med-Low)
  - Period 11: 119 (High)
  - Period 12: 84 (Low)
  - Period 13: 102 (Medium)
- **Moving Averages:**
  - Last 5 periods (P9-P13): Avg ~104 units.
  - Last 10 periods (P4-P13): Avg ~106 units.
  - The mean is stabilizing around 105-110, but the standard deviation is significant (~15-20 units).
- **Forecast:** We will use a target demand of **110** (slightly above mean to capture sales) but remain cautious about holding inventory due to the high $1 holding cost.

**2. Supply Chain & Lead Time**
- **Lead Time:** 4 periods (consistent).
- **On-Hand:** 39 units. Critically low.
- **Immediate Risk:** Period 14 demand will happen *after* arrivals.
- **Pipeline Arrivals (In-Transit = 490):**
  - **Period 14 arrival** (ordered P10): 125 units.
    - *Avail for P14 Demand:* 39 (on-hand) + 125 (arrival) = 164.
    - This is sufficient for P14 demand (forecast 110).
  - **Period 15 arrival** (ordered P11): 125 units.
  - **Period 16 arrival** (ordered P12): 130 units.
  - **Period 17 arrival** (ordered P13): 110 units.

**3. Coverage Calculation (Target: L+1 = 5 periods)**
We need to cover periods P14 through P18.
- **Projected Demand (P14-P18):** 5 periods * 110 units/period = 550 units.
- **Current Total Inventory (On-Hand + In-Transit):** 39 + 490 = 529 units.
- **Net Position:** 529 - 550 = **-21** (Shortfall).

**4. Safety Stock & Ordering Logic**
- The total inventory (529) almost exactly matches the mean demand for the 5-period horizon (525 @ 105 avg, or 550 @ 110 avg).
- Given the $1 holding cost, carrying large buffers is expensive. However, with only 39 units starting stock and a potentially volatile demand, we are slightly exposed if a demand spike >125 occurs repeatedly, though our pipeline flow (125, 125, 130, 110) is robust and matches our target well.
- The shortfall is minor (~21 units).
- To maintain the pipeline rhythm of keeping arrivals near the ~110-120 range (covering P18 demand with the order placed today), we should place an order.
- **Order Calculation:** Target P18 coverage.
  - We want arrival in P18 (from today's P14 order) to be ~110-120.
  - Since our net position is slightly negative (-21) relative to a 110 forecast, we should order a full period's supply plus a small buffer to close that gap.
  - Recommended Order: 120 units. This keeps the incoming flow consistent with demand.

{
  "rationale": "Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~105-110 (Last 5 avg 104) with moderate volatility. Current on-hand is critical (39) but a strong pipeline arrival (125) in P14 covers immediate risk. Total inventory (529) is slightly below the 5-period target coverage (550 @ 110/period). To maintain service levels for Period 18 without overstocking (given $1 holding cost), an order of 120 is placed to replenish the pipeline and close the slight coverage gap.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand volatility continues to oscillate (High/Low pattern broken slightly by P13's medium 102), with 5-period mean holding steady at ~104. Pipeline flow is now synchronized with mean demand, reducing stockout risk despite low on-hand inventory.",

Period 27 (Period_27) VM Action:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current state, here is the rationale and decision for Period 27.

**Rationale**
1.  **Demand Analysis:** The "Oscillating" pattern (Low ~120, High ~180) was disrupted in Period 26. Demand was 154, which is significantly higher than previous "Low" periods (121, 122). This suggests the demand regime has shifted to a consistently "High Volatility, High Mean" state. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is ~152 units, with peaks reaching 182.
2.  **Inventory Status:** We are in a critical stockout crisis. Ending inventory has been 0 for P25 and P26, and likely will be 0 in P27 due to insufficient arrivals (only 100 units arriving vs expected demand >150).
3.  **Pipeline Assessment:** The pipeline orders for P28 (155), P29 (155), and P30 (175) are barely sufficient to cover the mean demand (~152). They do *not* provide enough volume to rebuild a safety buffer or cover peak demands (180+).
4.  **Profitability:** With a Profit margin of $4 and Holding Cost of $1 (4:1 ratio), the cost of a stockout is 4x the cost of holding inventory. We should prioritize service level aggressively.
5.  **Order Calculation:** We are ordering for P31 arrival.
    *   Projected carryover into P31 is minimal (likely <20 units given the tight pipeline).
    *   To ensure coverage of a potential peak demand (182) and begin establishing a safety stock buffer (~40 units), we need ~220 units available in P31.
    *   Net Order = Target (220) - Projected Carryover (~20) = 200 units.
    *   This aggressive order helps break the "hand-to-mouth" cycle where supply just matches mean demand.

**Carry-over Insights**
Period 27: Oscillation pattern disrupted (P26=154 broke the low-sequence trend); new regime is High Volatility/High Mean (Avg ~152, Peak 182). Current pipeline (avg ~160) merely matches mean demand but fails to rebuild safety stock after P25-P27 stockouts. Aggressive ordering (200+) required to restore buffer and cover peaks.

{
  "rationale": "Inventory is 0. Demand regime confirmed as High Volatility (~152 avg, 182 peak). Current pipeline orders (155-175) only match average demand and do not allow for backlog recovery or safety stock accumulation. To break the stockout cycle and cover potential P31 peaks (182) plus buffer, an aggressive order of 200 is placed.",

Period 28 (Period_28) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Current state analysis: Period 28 opens with 0 inventory following three consecutive stockouts (P25-P27), indicating the pipeline has been trailing the surge in demand. Demand analysis: The last 3 periods (P25-P27) averaged ~169 units/period, with peaks reaching 179-182. The previous oscillation pattern is dampening into a sustained high-demand regime (Cycle: 179, 154, 174). Pipeline assessment: Incoming orders for P28 (155) and P29 (155) are likely below the projected mean demand of ~165-170, suggesting stockouts will persist or inventory will remain at zero until P30/P31 when larger orders (175, 200) arrive. Forecast & Logic: To break the stockout cycle and sustain a high service level against profitable demand ($4 margin vs $1 holding), we must target the upper range of the demand distribution. Assuming demand ~170 for P32, and factoring in slight buffer accumulation from the P31 arrival, an order of 175 is required to match consumption and secure a modest safety stock (~40-50 units). Under-ordering risk outweighs over-ordering due to high stockout costs.",

The 'High Regime' generally averages ~155-160 units/period (e.g., P23-P27 avg ~162). P31's 134 suggests some volatility/moderation but stays well above the crash levels.\n\n2.  **Supply Chain Gap**: We face a critical supply gap because orders in P29 and P30 were 0.

Based on the current observation and historical patterns, here is the decision for Period 43.

**Rationale**
(a) **Demand Analysis**: Demand exhibits extreme volatility (recent samples: 177, 88, 70), indicating a bimodal distribution with peaks near ~180 and troughs <90. The 5-period rolling average is ~86, but the "High Regime" average is ~140.
(b) **Supply Valley**: We are entering the "Supply Valley" previously identified: P43 and P44 will have zero arrivals (due to P39/P40 orders). Current on-hand inventory (293 units) must cover demand for both periods.
(c) **Stockout Risk**: If demand averages >146 over P43-P44, a stockout will occur in P44. Inventory will likely degrade significantly before the P45 replenishment (130 units) arrives.
(d) **Pipeline Logic**: Current In-transit (270 units) covers P45-P46. Total Supply (On-hand 293 + In-transit 270 = 563) covers P43-P46 (~140 unit/period coverage). 
(e) **Order**: To maintain this ~140 unit/period throughput (protecting against the 4x penalty of lost sales vs holding costs), and to refill the buffer for Period 47 after the expected depletion in P43-46, an order of 135 is placed. This balances the risk of high-demand stockouts against low-demand inventory bloat.

The supply gap from previous zero-orders hits fully in P44 (0 arrivals), meaning P44 sales rely entirely on the 143 starting inventory; if demand matches recent highs (~150+), a stockout will occur.

Current pipeline (P45-P48 arrivals ~136/period) is healthy against average demand (~105-115) and will likely build a moderate buffer (~70-150 units) by start of P49. However, covering P49 and P50 demand (approx 230-300 units total) requires extending the supply chain. Current carryover projections show a deficit of 50-180 units for the final two periods depending on volatility. Since stockout cost ($4 lost margin) exceeds holding risk ($1/period for max 2 periods -> $2 max cost), it is profitable to bias towards coverage. Ordering 100 units now secures P49 supply and leaves flexibility for a final P46 top-up order.",

  "rationale": "Step-by-step analysis for Period 46:\n\n1.  **Demand Analysis**: Demand remains extremely volatile with no predictable mean. Recent sequence: P40=177, P41=88, P42=70, P43=150, P44=115, P45=8. The shocking drop to 8 in P45 (similar to P38=0) confirms a 'bimodal' pattern where demand either crashes (<20) or surges (>100). The 4-period average is ~85, but the 'surviving' average (excluding crashes) is ~125.\n\n2.  **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current On-hand is 150. Total Pipeline (In-transit) is 515. The pipeline consists of: P42 order (140, arrives P46), P43 (135, arrives P47), P44 (140, arrives P48), P45 (100, arrives P49). \n\n3.  **Balances**: \n   - P46 Supply: 150 (on-hand) + 140 (arriving) = 290. Even if demand spikes to historical max (~187), we are safe.\n   - P47 Supply: Leftover from P46 + 135 (arriving). Likely safe.\n   - P48 Supply: Leftover + 140 (arriving). Likely safe.\n   - P49 Supply: Leftover + 100 (arriving).\n\n4.  **Forecast & Strategy**: The primary risk is now overstock due to the P45 crash (demand=8). We have ~665 units available/arriving for the next 4 periods (avg ~166/period), which covers even the *highest* sustained demand. However, the order placed now (P46) arrives in P50. Since the horizon is typically 50 periods, an order arriving in P50 has very limited utility (likely 0 sales opportunity before game end or truncated horizon). Given the high existing inventory coverage (~290 available immediately) and the pattern of demand crashes, adding more stock for the very end of the game is financially risky. To maximize final profit, we should burn down existing inventory and avoid holding costs on units that may arrive too late to sell.",
