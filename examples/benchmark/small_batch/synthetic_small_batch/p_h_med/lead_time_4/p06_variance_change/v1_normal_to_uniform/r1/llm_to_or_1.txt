Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, the system must place a large initial order to fill the pipeline for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods total). Historical data (mean ~98 units) suggests high variance. I am using default parameters to establish a baseline safety stock and pipeline coverage based on the full available history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2. Current on-hand is 0 with 142 units in transit (ordered P1). Observed P1 demand (118) aligns heavily with the high-demand samples in the provided history (122, 121), though the history also contains lower values (60, 83). I will use an explicit forecast that averages the 5 provided historical samples plus the 1 actual observation to form a robust prior. Mean = ~101.5 per period. With current lead time L=4, the protection interval is 5 periods. Target covers 5 periods of demand plus safety stock.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 3 decision phase. Observed history covers Period 1 and 2. 

1. **Demand Analysis**: History shows P1=118, P2=155. Though the historical data provided in the prompt context (P1=122, P2=121, P3=60...) differs from the game enactment history (P1=118, P2=155). The enactment history is the ground truth for this session. The provided historical samples in the preamble likely represent broader historical context or a different dataset. I will weigh the recent enacted demand heavily but incorporate the provided sample mean as a stabilizer if needed. Average enactment demand = (118+155)/2 = 136.5. This is fairly high volatility. Given the limited enacted history (only 2 data points), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the broader historical samples provided in the context (P1-P5) combined with recent observations if the backend implementation merges them, or simply rely on the provided sample data if that's how 'default' behaves. Actually, standard practice here is to look at the 'Historical Demand Data' section provided in the prompt (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). The average of those 5 samples is ~98. The enacted demand (118, 155) is significantly higher than that average. This suggests a demand surge or regime change. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 based on enacted history to capture this higher demand, but since I can't calculate N=2 on just the provided 5 samples (which end at P5?), I have to be careful. The prompt says 'Use these samples (P1-P5=122,121,60,83,105) to inform your forecast'. But the 'Game History' shows P1=118, P2=155. This is a conflict. I will trust the Game History (enacted reality) over the static samples. Since I only have 2 enacted points, I will use an explicit forecast roughly averaging the recent enacted values (136.5) to avoid understocking. Let's start with a conservative explicit forecast closer to the enacted average. 

Calculated mu: (1+L) * AvgDemand. L=4. AvgDemand approx 137. Total = 5 * 137 = 685.
Calculated sigma: sqrt(1+L) * StdDev. StdDev of (118, 155) is approx 26. Total = 2.23 * 26 = 58.

2. **Lead Time**: Promised L=4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order arrives in P5). No evidence to deviate from default.

3. **Inventory**: On-hand 0. In-transit 285 (142 from P1 + 143 from P2). We are stocked out and losing sales ($4 profit/unit). It is critical to order enough to cover the lead time gap.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant amount in-transit (465 units) from orders in Periods 1, 2, and 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we haven't reached Period 5 yet (when the Period 1 order is expected to arrive: 1 ordered + 4 lead = arrive Period 5), no orders have concluded. We have no evidence to contradict the promised lead time of 4 periods. Demand history (observed samples: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 - note: the prompt provided explicit samples in the instructions which differ slightly from the game history logs. I will prioritize the explicit historical samples provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section of the prompt as the ground truth for parameter estimation, while noting the discrepancies in the logs might be due to unfilled demand or noise. The samples are: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105). The average of these 5 samples is 98.2. There is high variance. Given the short history and no lead time data, I will stick to default methods (all history) for demand and the default promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 5. The first order, placed in Period 1, had a promised lead time of 4 periods and is expected to arrive during this period (confirmation will appear in the Period 6 conclude message). The absence of arrivals so far is consistent with the promised lead time (L=4). Demand over Periods 1-4 (118, 155, 128, 117) averages ~129.5 units, which is significantly higher and more stable than the provided historical samples. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical ratio), we utilize the full recent history (N=4) to establish a robust base stock that protects against stockouts while waiting for the pipeline to start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand consistently higher than historical profile; observed avg ~130 over P1-P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on Period 5 conclusion (Period 1 order arrived). Actual realized demand (Periods 1-5) averages ~123.2, which is higher than the pre-game historical samples. P5 demand (98) was lower than P2 peak (155), suggesting volatility. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility parameters to capture the full realized game history rather than pre-game data. Current inventory (44) plus expected arrival (P2 order: 143) covers projected demand for this period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5 in Period 5 conclude message).

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods per concluded history (P2 order arrived P6). Demand in P5 and P6 dropped to 98, significantly lower than the P1-P4 average (~130). While this suggests a potential downward shift, the critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (4+1)) favors service level over inventory reduction. Consequently, I am using the full observed history (N=6) for demand parameters to avoid understocking if the dip is temporary noise. On-hand (89) plus In-transit (469) totals 558, covering roughly 4.7 periods at current avg demand (~119), necessitating a replenishment order to cover the full Protection Interval (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand dip in P5-P6 (avg 98) contrasts with P1-P4 (avg ~130); monitoring if this 25% drop is a sustained new regime.

Daily Profit: $188.00, Daily Holding Cost: $222.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 8. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P3 order arrived P7). Demand has shown a sharp downward trend: P1-P4 averaged ~130, P5-P6 averaged 98, and P7 dropped to 47. This 47 is a significant low point. To avoid overstocking (current inventory position is high at 589 units vs declining demand), I am switching to 'recent_N=3' for the demand forecast, which gives an average of ~81 (mean of 98, 98, 47). This is responsive to the drop without solely relying on the single low point of P7. Sigma is set to 'recent_N=5' to capture volatility across both the recent dip and the preceding moderate period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely: Period 7 observed demand 47, dragging 3-period avg to ~81, significantly below early game avg of ~130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals for P1-P4 orders). Demand analysis clearly indicates a regime shift starting around Period 5. Early demand (P1-P4) averaged ~130, while recent demand (P5-P8) averages ~81.5, a drop of ~37%. Given the current high inventory position (IP=506) relative to this reduced demand forecast (~407 for 5 periods), the priority is correcting the overstock. I am setting N=4 for demand estimators to focus strictly on this lower demand regime and exclude the earlier high values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P5-P8 avg ~81.5 vs P1-P4 avg ~130, a sustained ~37% drop over 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $492.00, Daily Holding Cost: $232.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 demand rebounded to 123 units, effectively reverting to early-game levels and contradicting the hypothesis of a sustained drop to ~81 units seen in P7-P8. The demand pattern is now characterized by high volatility (P7=47 vs P9=123) rather than a stable low mean. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), stockouts are costly. Therefore, we switch to using the full history (N=9) for demand estimation to incorporate the higher early-game values and the high variance, ensuring a robust safety stock buffer against potential high demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed P5-P9 (range 47-123, avg ~90) vs stable P1-P4 (avg ~130). P9 rebound (123) invalidates the stable low-regime hypothesis.

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 decision. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by Period 10 conclude). Demand analysis shows a clear structural break: the initial high demand of Periods 1-4 (avg ~130) has been replaced by a lower, more volatile regime in Periods 5-10 (avg ~90). Using full history would inflate forecasts and cause overstocking. Therefore, we switch to 'recent_N' (N=6) for demand mean and variance to focus solely on this new P5-P10 regime. Current inventory position (213 on-hand + 237 in-transit = 450) exactly covers the expected mean demand during the protection interval (5 * 90 = 450), relying on the safety stock calculation to handle the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Structural break confirmed: Demand shifted from early high regime (P1-P4 avg ~130) to sustained lower regime (P5-P10 avg ~90).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand has settled into a lower, volatile regime (avg ~93 over last 5 periods vs initial ~130). We implement 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to filter out irrelevant early-game high demand and focus on the current volatile pattern (ranging from 47 to 123). Current inventory+transit (379) is below the 5-period target (~465), necessitating an order.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 demand (84) is consistent with the lower-but-volatile regime established since Period 5 (avg ~93, range 47-123). While Periods 9-11 showed signs of recovery (avg ~111), the drop in Period 12 suggests continued volatility rather than a return to the early high stable mean (~130). I select N=8 for demand parameters to capture the full extent of this volatility (from the low 47 to the high 123) which defines the current post-break regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P12 arrival of 0 matches P8 order of 0).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 stock is 0 after a stockout in P13 (demand 102 vs 88 stock). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised). Demand analysis shows a partial recovery/stabilization in recent periods (P9-P13 avg ~104) compared to the deep dip seen in P7-P8. Using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility appropriately captures this recent stabilization around ~100-105 units without being dragged down by the outlier low in Period 7 (47 units) or overly influenced by the initial high regime. This responsive setting aims to recover service levels given the current 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed P9-P13: Average demand recovered to ~104 (range 84-123), up from the temporary depressed average of ~81 observed in P5-P8.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P10 order arrived P14). Demand in P14 (130) reinforces a recovery trend; the P9-P14 average is ~108, distinct from the P5-P8 dip (~81). Inventory is tight (29 on-hand), with a net position (422) below the expected 5-period demand (~540). Using recent_N=6 for demand parameters to capture this stabilized 'recovery' regime and trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P9-P14 average demand is ~108 (ranging 84-130), stabilizing significantly above the depressed P5-P8 trough (~81.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 decision based on Period 15 conclusion. Demand recovery is confirmed and stabilizing: the average demand over the recovery phase (Periods 9-15) is ~110 units, with recent peaks of 130 (P14) and 123 (P15) suggesting a potential return to the early high-demand regime. The depressed demand period (P5-P8, avg ~81) is now firmly in the past, but its legacy affects current inventory, causing stockouts in P13 and P15 due to insufficient pipeline orders from that era. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (Period 15 arrival matched Period 11 order exactly). To address the recent stockouts and service the higher demand level, I am using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility parameters. This captures the upward trend (samples: 119, 84, 102, 130, 123; mean ~111.6) while smoothing the volatility, effectively raising the base stock target to prevent further lost sales given the high Cost of Underage ($4 profit vs $1 holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P9-P15 average stabilizers ~110 units, with recent highs (130, 123) aligning with the early game high-demand regime (~130). Previous low regime (P5-P8) is invalidated.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 17. The system is critically low on inventory (4 units on hand) after stockouts in P13 and P15, and near-stockouts in P16. Demand in the last 3 periods (P14-P16) has surged to an average of ~131 units (130, 123, 139), effectively returning to the high-demand regime seen in early history (P1-P4). The mid-game dip is decisively over. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P12 order arrived P16). To address the shortage and the reinstated high demand, I am using a short N=3 for mu_hat to closely track the recent surge (~131 avg) and a slightly longer N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility of the recovery ramp-up (including the dip in P12). This combination aims to maximize the order quantity up to the cap to rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime sustained: P14-P16 average ~131 matches early peaks, confirming recovery from mid-game dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 18. On-hand is 0, indicating recent parameters have been tight relative to demand. Lead time remains stable at observed 4 periods (P13 order arrived P17), and in-transit inventory (546) matches the sum of open orders (P14-P17), so no shipments are lost. Demand analysis for P14-P17 shows a strong sustained high-demand regime (avg ~125 units), similar to the early game, despite a variance in P17 (107 units). To address recurring stockouts (0 ending inventory in P13, P15, P17), we use a short N=4 for mu_hat to aggressively target this recent high mean (~125). We use a longer N=9 for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility (std dev ~18) observed during the P9-P17 recovery period, ensuring adequate safety stock given the high cost of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime stabilized: P14-P17 average demand is ~125, confirming a return to early-game levels (P1-P4 avg ~130) after the mid-game dip.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (observed in P6, P14, P18 concludes). Demand shows increased volatility: after a high-demand streak in P14-P16 (avg ~130), P17 (107) and P18 (78) dropped significantly. Despite the low P18 observation, the Critical Ratio (0.8) favors maintaining service levels over aggressive inventory reduction. We select N=5 for forecast parameters to capture this full volatile range (78-139), averaging ~115, which smooths the recent drop while respecting the high upside potential. Current inventory position (52 on-hand + 528 in-transit = 580) is tight against nearly 5 periods of expected demand (5 * 115 = 575), justifying continued ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike: P14-P18 shows a wide range (78-139), destabilizing the previous high-regime hypothesis (avg ~130). Recent average (P14-P18) settles around 115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 report: Demand in P19 dropped significantly to 66 units, following a low P18 (78), contrasting sharply with the P14-P17 high-demand period (avg ~112). This suggests a return to a lower or more volatile demand regime similar to the mid-game dip (P5-P8). The 6-period moving average (P14-P19) is approximately 107 units/period, but the most recent 2 periods averaged only 72. Given the high volatility (range 66-139 recently) and the recent downward trend, a conservative forecast using a wider recent window is prudent to smooth out the noise while respecting the potential downward shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position (125 on-hand + 432 in-transit = 557) covers ~5 periods of moderate demand, so the system is relatively safe, but parameters should reflect the lower recent observed mean to avoid overstocking if the dip persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P18-P19 localized dip (avg 72) contrasts with P16-P17 peak (avg 123), keeping overall P14-P19 average near 107.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 observation confirms a sustained downward shift in demand over the last 3 periods (P18-P20 avg 64.3 vs P14-P17 avg 124.7). Demand dropped from 78 -> 66 -> 49. This recent low-demand cluster significantly impacts the optimal stocking level. I will switch to a 'recent_N' estimator with N=3 to quickly adapt to this low-volume regime and prevent inventory bloating (current on-hand 185 is high relative to recent demand of ~50-60). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P18, P19, P20).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand contraction P18-P20: Average demand dropped to ~64 units, compared to ~124 units in P14-P17. This 48% drop suggests a new low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 Analysis:

1. **Demand Context**: We are in a confirmed low-demand regime. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 67 units (78, 66, 49, 75), which is a 46% drop from the prior high regime of ~125 (P14-P17). This dip is sustained and significant, resembling the dip seen earlier in P5-P8.

2. **Inventory Situation**: 
   - On-hand: 278 units (very high due to ordering during the transition from high to low demand).
   - Pipeline (In-transit): 190 units (P18: 112, P19: 43, P20: 35). 
   - Total Supply: 468 units.
   - Expected Demand over L+1 (5 periods): 5 * 67 = 335. 
   - We are currently overstocked relative to the new low demand. The system will naturally stop ordering, but we must align the forecast parameters to the new reality to prevent future overstocking once inventory burns down.

3. **Lead Time**: Consistent 4 periods observed in almost every concluded shipment.

4. **Parameter Selection**:
   - **L**: Default (4 periods). Stable.
   - **mu_hat**: 'recent_N' with N=4. This captures the P18-P21 low regime (avg ~67), ensuring the base stock level drops reflecting the contraction. Using a larger N would dilute this signal with the outdated high demand from P17.
   - **sigma_hat**: 'recent_N' with N=4. Volatility in the low regime (std dev ~13) is much lower than the transition period.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed P18-P21: avg demand ~67, down 46% from prior peak (avg ~124).

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand (121) represents a sharp departure (+80%) from the P18-P21 low-demand average (~67), strongly suggesting a return to the high-demand regime observed in P14-P17 (~125 avg). With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the cost of understocking during a high-demand resurgence is severe. Therefore, we pivot aggressively away from the recent low average. We set mu_hat explicitly based on a forecast of ~120 units/period (total 600 over 5 periods) to ensure coverage. We use recent_N=5 for sigma to capture the high volatility introduced by this sudden jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound in Period 22 (121 units) breaks the low-demand trend of P18-P21 (avg ~67), signaling a likely return to the high-demand regime (avg ~125) typically seen in this item's history.

With a profit margin of 4:1 (Service Level 80%), avoiding stockouts is critical. Given the recent volatility (49 in P20 to 182 in P23), we use a short memory (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This sets the forecast average around 126 (realigning with the historical high regime of ~130) and captures recent volatility in the safety stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 23 reached historical max 182, breaking the recent low trend (P18-P21 avg ~67). Last 3 periods average 126, realigning with the early game high-demand regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. Assessment: Demand has definitively exited the low-volume dip (P18-P21, avg ~67) and surged into a high-volume regime (P22-P24 avg ~142). The recent spike in Period 23 (182 units) drives the 3-period average significantly higher than the long-term historical mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position (43 on-hand + 379 in-transit = 422) is dangerously low against a protection interval demand of approximately 710 units (5 periods * ~142). Action: Switch to 'recent_N' (N=3) for both mu and sigma to aggressively capture the new high demand level and increased volatility, ensuring sufficient replenishment for the lead time horizon.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: P22-P24 average demand is ~142 units (range 121-182), sharply reversing the P18-P21 dip (~67). Volatility has increased with the P23 spike to 182.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has surged to a new peak regime (avg ~151 over last 4 periods), significantly exceeding historical averages. We are stocking out due to this surge. We switch to recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to capture this aggressive new mean and high volatility (range 121-182). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Demand remains in the 'Super-High' regime identified in Period 26, with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaging ~152 units (range 121-182). This is significantly higher than the long-term history. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P23/P24). Despite a large pipeline (787 units), we have faced stockouts in P25 and P26 due to the surge. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5. This focuses the forecast strictly on the current high-demand regime, excluding the lower demand data from P18-P21, ensuring the base stock level rises sufficiently to cover the new mean (~152) plus volatility buffer.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 28. The 'Super-High' demand regime identified in P22-P25 has sustained and intensified through P27, with the last 3 periods (P25-P27) averaging ~169 units (peaks of 179, 174). This is significantly above the historical high average of ~130. We have experienced 3 consecutive stockouts (P25-P27) as inventory lags behind these surges. Although a large arrival (215 units from P24) is expected in P28, the low order quantity in P27 (27 units) creates a risk of future stockouts when it arrives. To compensate and ensure service levels (target 0.80) are met in this volatile high-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat to the very recent N=3 average (~169) to drive a higher base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Super-High demand regime intensification: P25-P27 average demand is ~169 units, exhibiting high volatility and causing consecutive stockouts. This exceeds the initial P22-P25 shift (avg ~151) and necessitates aggressive parametrization.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation: Period 28 demand crashed to 26 units, effectively zeroing out the 'Super-High' regime (P22-P27 avg ~162). This signals a massive structural break or a one-off outlier. However, looking at the history, this product oscillates violently between regimes (Low ~70, High ~130, Super-High ~160). The crash to 26 is unprecedentedly low. 

Inventory status: On-hand is 189. In-transit is high (646). Total pipeline = 835. Even if demand recovers to 'High' levels (~130), 5 periods of demand is 650, so we are currently overstocked relative to a reverted mean. 

Strategy: 
1. Lead Time: Confirmed stable at 4 periods (P24 order arrived P28). Use Recent_N=5 or Default.
2. Demand (Mu): The drop to 26 is dangerous to ignore, but reacting fully to it might cause a stockout if it's a single outlier. However, combined with the ending of the super-high run, we must pivot. I will shift to a 'recent' estimate including the drop to dampen the forecast without assuming 26 is the new permanent mean. Previous low regime was ~70-80. I'll use a weighted view (EWMA) or short recent N to capture the downtrend quickly. Let's use `recent_N = 3` (P26:154, P27:174, P28:26 -> avg ~118). This bridges the gap between the super-high peaks and the crash, providing a safer buffer than assuming 26, while backing off from the aggressive 170+ forecast. 
3. Sigma: Volatility is extreme (174 to 26). I will increase safety stock responsiveness using `recent_N = 3` to capture this massive variance spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash P28: Demand dropped to 26 units (historical min), shattering the 'Super-High' regime (P22-P27 avg ~162). Structural break or extreme outlier suspected.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: Demand has crashed dramatically and sustained that crash for a second period (P28: 26, P29: 46; avg 36), decisively ending the 'Super-High' regime. This crash leaves the system massively overstocked with 343 units on-hand and 446 in-transit (Total Pipeline: 789), against a 5-period forecast of roughly 180 units at current rates. The priority is to halt ordering completely to burn down inventory and avoid excessive holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting forecast parameters to 'recent_N=2' to align strictly with the new crashed demand levels (avg 36), ensuring the base stock target drops well below the current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed: P28-P29 average is 36 units, significantly below even the prior 'Low' regime (~67) and marking a distinct structural break from the 'Super-High' regime (avg ~162).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed demand in Period 30 was 187 units, a new historical maximum, sharply reversing the low demand seen in Periods 28-29 (26 and 46 units). This suggests P28-P29 were transient volatility or outliers rather than a structural break to a low regime. Given the high cost of stockouts (critical ratio 0.8), we must protect against the return of this high demand. We select a lookback window of N=9 (Periods 22-30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full 'post-low-regime' era, averaging ~132 units, but includes the extreme volatility (26 to 187), which will appropriately inflate sigma and safety stock to buffer against future swings. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand rebound in Period 30 (187 units) invalidates the P28-P29 low-regime hypothesis. The item is confirmed to be in a high-volatility regime (P22-P30 avg ~132) with extreme range (26-187).

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Demand in P31 (134 units) helps confirm that the crash in P28-29 was a temporary volatility event/outlier, and we have returned to the higher demand levels seen prior. The last 2 periods (P30-P31) average ~160, but P31's drop to 134 suggests settling. We use a 10-period rolling window (N=10) for both mu and sigma. This window covers the high-demand streak of P22-P27, the crash of P28-29, and the recovery of P30-P31, resulting in a representative mean of ~132 units and a high standard deviation to buffer against the demonstrated extreme volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime persistence: P22-P31 avg demand is ~132 with extreme range (26-187). The P28-P29 crash is interpreted as volatility/outlier within this high-variance regime rather than a structural low shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-393.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Demand in Period 32 crashed to 15 units, following a high of 134 and a surge of 187. The pattern from P28-P32 is extremely volatile, oscillating between deep lows (26, 46, 15) and highs (187, 134). Current total inventory (453 on-hand + 302 in-transit = 755) is very high due to the recent demand crash. Given the 4:1 critical ratio favoring service, we avoid over-reacting to the lows. We use a 10-period window (avg ~122) to smooth the oscillation and maintain a robust safety stock, though the system will likely order 0 this period to burn down the excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Oscillating Demand Regime P28-P32: The demand profile has become bi-modal or extremely unstable, alternating between severe crashes (15-46 units) and high peaks (134-187 units). 5-period average is ~82 but unreliable for forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 34. Demand in P33 was 86, recovering from the P32 crash (15) but remaining volatile. The last 10 periods (P24-P33) display extreme variance, ranging from 15 to 187, effectively oscillating between demand crashes and 'super-high' peaks. The average over this volatile window is ~112, close to the long-term historical mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high cost of lost sales (ratio 0.8) and the unpredictability of the next spike (e.g., P30 jumped to 187 after P29's 46), I am selecting N=10 for both mean and volatility estimation. This incorporates the high-demand peaks (P24-P27) into the forecast, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover sudden surges, rather than reacting solely to the recent lower average of the chaotic P28-P33 block.

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility persists P28-P33: Alternating crashes (15-46) and peaks (134-187) continue, with P33 (86) landing in between. 10-period average (~112) is the most robust estimator amidst this chaos.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 decision. The system is in a sustained 'High-Variance Oscillating Regime' (P28-P34). Demand continues to swing wildly between crashes (e.g., 15 in P32) and highs (e.g., 123 in P34, 187 in P30). The 10-period average (~112) has proven stable despite individual period chaos, smoothing out the extreme outliers better than shorter windows. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P32 conclude). Given the high profit margin (crit ratio 0.8) and extreme standard deviation, using a 10-period window for both mean and sigma ensures high safety stock to cover potential spikes like P30 while anchoring the base forecast to the robust mean.

Carry-over insight: High-Variance Oscillating Regime P28-P34 continues: Demand swings wildly (range 15-187) with no clear directional trend, but the 10-period average remains robust at ~112.

Daily Reward (R_t): $233.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 observation: Demand has stabilized significantly in the last two periods (P34: 123, P35: 130), averaging ~126.5, which aligns with the historical high-demand regime (~130) and rejects the P32 crash (15) as an outlier. Although the 10-period average (~107) is robust, it is biased downward by the extreme crashes in P28, P29, and P32. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), it is safer to parametrise for the recovering 'Normal High' regime. I will use a short N=2 for mu_hat to lock onto this recent stability (avg 126.5) and a medium N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the lingering volatility risk (including the P32 crash) to buffer safety stock. Pipeline (555) covers ~111 units/period, which is below the current run rate (126-130), necessitating a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed P34-P35: Average 126.5 (range 123-130) signals a return to the 'Normal High' regime, moving away from the extreme oscillatory crashes of P28-P32. Volatility remains relevant but the mean is shifting up.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Demand crashed to 27 in P36, confirming a persistent oscillating regime (peaks ~180, crashes ~20). With 700 units in pipeline and avg demand ~104 (last 10 periods), we are well-stocked. We switch to recent_N=10 for mu/sigma to capture the full oscillation cycle and prevent over-reaction to single-period crashes while maintaining coverage for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Oscillating demand confirmed: P36 crash (27) follows stability (P34-35 avg 126), perpetuating a high-variance toggle between <30 and >130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 demand exploded to 169 units immediately following the Period 36 crash (27 units), confirming the 'High-Variance Oscillating' regime identified in carry-over insights. This regime (active since P28) is characterized by violent swings between <30 and >160 units. To manage this, we rely on a recent_N=8 moving average (P30-P37), which yields a mean of ~109 units. This window captures both the extreme peaks and the crashes, providing a representative forecast. The high resulting standard deviation will naturally boost safety stock to protect against the frequent spikes (Profit ratio 0.8 favors stocking up). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility persists P36-P37 (27 -> 169), reinforcing the bimodal nature (crashes <30, spikes >160) observed since P28. However, the moving average is recovering: P34-P37 average ~112 is significantly higher than the P28-P33 trough (~82).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-236.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand of 0 confirms the persistence of the extreme oscillating regime (range 0-187). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With a healthy pipeline (IP=662) covering >7 periods of average demand (~92), we apply N=10 smoothing to capture the full volatility profile without over-reacting to the P38 drop.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand hit 0 in Period 38, widening the volatility range to [0, 187] and confirming the bimodal boom-bust pattern established in Period 28. 10-period average (~92) remains the most robust central estimator.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-volatility oscillating regime (P28-P39) persists, with demand swinging wildly between crashes (confirmed 0 in P38) and spikes (169 in P37, 187 in P30). The 10-period rolling average (~96.5) remains the most robust estimator to smooth these bimodal extremes ([0, 187]) without overreacting to single-period noise. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. We employ 'recent_N=10' for both demand and volatility parameters to align inventory buffers with this sustained unpredictable variance.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime persists P28-P39: Range expanded to [0, 187] following zero demand in P38. 10-period average (~96.5) continues to provide a stable central tendency amidst extreme noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 demand (177 units) underscores the persistent extreme volatility regime, swinging from 0 (P38) to near-max (177) within two periods. The 10-period average (P31-P40) is ~95.5, which remains the most reliable anchor amidst these wild oscillations (range 0-187). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high cost of lost sales (ratio 0.8), I am using N=10 for both demand and volatility to capture the full extent of this variance distribution, allowing the safety stock component to buffer against the frequent spikes while the mean reflects the lower average caused by the crashes.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime persists P31-P40: Demand continues to swing unpredictably between 0 and 187, with no directional trend. 10-period average (~95.5) remains a stable central estimator.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 demand (88 units) aligns closely with the 10-period average (~91), confirming the persistence of the high-volatility oscillating regime (range 0-187) active since Period 28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P36 order arrived P40). Given the extreme variance (standard deviation >60) and high cost of stockouts (Profit ratio 0.8), I am using a moving window of N=10 for both demand and uncertainty calibration. This smooths the extreme 'boom-bust' signals (e.g., 0 vs 177) while maintaining a safety stock buffer sufficient to cover the unpredictable spikes.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Demand continues in the high-volatility regime established since Period 28. Recent observations (P39-P42: 94, 177, 88, 70) show a mix of spikes and moderate values, averaging ~107, which is slightly higher than the 10-period average of ~96.4. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P38 order arrived P42). Given the erratic swings between 0 and 177, the robust 10-period rolling window (N=10) remains the best estimator for both mean (mu) and volatility (sigma), smoothing out the extreme noise while retaining the risk profile of the peaks. Current pipeline (501 units) covers approx 5 periods of average demand, which is lean given the potential for back-to-back spikes; N=10 sigma ensures adequate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: The high-volatility oscillating regime (observed since P28) continues, with Period 43 demand hitting 150 units after recent lows (70, 88). The 10-period average (P34-P43) is ~103 units, but the range is extreme (0 to 177). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P42 arrival). Given current on-hand inventory (83) is low relative to potential spikes, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu and sigma. This window captures the full extent of the volatility (including the zero demand and the 177 spike), ensuring the safety stock calculation buffers against the high variance while the mean remains robust.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime persists P28-P43: Demand fluctuates widely (range 0-177), with a robust 10-period average of ~103 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 ended with critically low inventory (5 units), highlighting the risk of the recent demand surges (150 in P43, 177 in P40). Although the regime remains volatile, the 'floor' of the oscillations appears to be rising (recent lows 70-88 vs previous 0-27), and the 5-period average (~120) is notably higher than the 10-period average (~102). To prevent stockouts in this high-risk environment (CR=0.8), we switch mu_hat to a shorter N=5 window to capture the local upward trend, while keeping sigma_hat on a wider N=10 window to account for the full range of volatility (including the P38 crash) in the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime persists P28-P44, but the demand floor is rising (recent low 70 vs prior 0) and the 5-period average (~120) has overtaken the 10-period average (~102), indicating a local upward shift in the volatile pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-134.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 Analysis: The high-volatility oscillating regime (P28-P45) persists. The most recent demand was an extreme crash (8 units in P45), following a stable block of ~115-150. This continues the established pattern of alternating crashes (<30) and spikes (>150). 

Lead Time: P41 order arrived in P45, confirming lead time remains 4 periods. 

Parameter Selection: 
- L: 'default' (4) is stable.
- mu_hat: The 10-period average (~91 units) is the most robust estimator because shorter windows (like recent_5) fluctuate too wildly due to the extreme outliers (like 8 or 177). The recent demand of 8 pulls the short-term average down deceptively. Given the volatility, stick to a longer horizon to serve the average demand. 
- sigma_hat: Volatility is extreme. 'recent_10' captures the full range of the oscillating cycle (including 0, 8, and 177) better than shorter windows.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime continues P28-P45: Demand crashed to 8 units in P45, confirming the persistent boom-bust cycle (range 0-187). 10-period average (~91) remains the most reliable central estimator.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 of 50. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now would arrive in Period 51, after the game concludes. Furthermore, total inventory exposure (On-hand 190 + In-transit 474 = 664 units) is extremely high, easily covering the remaining ~4 periods of expected demand (historical avg ~100/period implies ~400 total need). The current high-volatility oscillating regime (peaks ~177, lows ~8) requires robust estimation, so we stick to the 10-period average to characterize the distribution, though the system will likely order 0 due to the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime continues P28-P46: Recent demand dip (8, 38) in P45-46 fits the established boom-bust pattern. 10-period average has softened to ~91 but remains the best central estimator amidst noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 48/50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods (order P48 -> arrive P52), any order placed now will arrive after the game concludes at Period 50. Current Total Pipeline (On-hand 175 + In-transit 386 = 561) is sufficient to cover maximum potential demand for the remaining 3 periods (approx max 180*3 = 540). To prevent wasteful inventory accumulation that cannot be sold, I am explicitly setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 0 to force the backend to order 0 units.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility oscillating regime persists P28-P47: Demand 103 fits pattern. 10-period average declined to ~84. End-of-horizon: Orders P48+ arrive post-game (L=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. With a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed today would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game horizon (Period 50). Therefore, no further ordering is useful. We currently have 176 units on-hand and 200 units arriving this period (ordered Period 45), giving a total sellable inventory of 376 units for the remaining 2 periods. The maximum historical demand observed is 187; covering two periods of maximum demand requires 374 units. Our inventory (376) is sufficient to cover even the worst-case scenario without stocking out. I am setting demand parameters to 0 to force the base-stock policy to order 0 units.

Carry-over insight: End-of-horizon strategy (P49): With L=4, orders placed now arrive post-game. Current inventory (376) covers worst-case demand for remaining 2 periods (max need ~374).

Daily Profit: $268.00, Daily Holding Cost: $309.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 54, which is beyond the simulation horizon (identified in P48/P49 insights). Current on-hand inventory (309 units) is sufficient to cover any remaining in-period demand. The optimal strategy is to force the order quantity to zero to prevent accumulating holding costs for useless inventory. We achieve this by explicitly setting demand parameters to 0.

Carry-over insight: Game conclusion: High-volatility oscillating regime persisted through the end (P28-P50), with demand swinging between [0-187]. Final inventory 309 covers remaining needs.
