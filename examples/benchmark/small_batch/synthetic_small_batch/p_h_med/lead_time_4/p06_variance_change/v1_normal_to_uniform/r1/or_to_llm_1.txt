  "rationale": "We are in Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive for sales in Period 6. We have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, starting completely fresh. Historical demand data provided (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) shows an average demand around 98 units, but with significant variance (ranging from 60 to 122). \n\nThe OR recommendation is 142 units. Let's analyze this. \nThe target base stock needs to cover the review period (1) + lead time (4) = 5 periods of demand. \nEstimated 5-period demand = 5 * 98.2 = ~491 units. \nSafety stock would be added on top. \nSince we have 0 inventory, the base stock calculation suggests we should order a large amount to fill the pipeline (enough for 5 periods).

However, to build up stock for Period 6 onwards, we need to order consistently. The capped amount (142) is reasonable to start filling the pipeline without overreacting to the initial zero state, as ordering the full base stock (500+) immediately might cause a bullwhip effect if demand drops later.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead Time Inference\nWe are in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (142 units) is currently In-Transit and has not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). This is expected behavior since lead time is likely greater than 0. We have no concluded lead time observations yet.\n\nStep 2: Inventory Position\n- On-hand: 0\n- In-transit: 142 (from Period 1)\n- Total Pipeline: 142\n- Unsatisfied demand last period: Demand was 118, Sold 0. We stocked out immediately.\n\nStep 3: Demand Estimation\nAvailable Historical Demand (provided in rules):\n- P1: 122\n- P2: 121\n- P3: 60\n- P4: 83\n- P5: 105\n- Period 1 actual demand (game history): 118\n\nThe historical samples suggest an average slightly above 100, though with variance (low of 60, high of 122). The most recent actual demand (118) aligns with the higher end of the historical samples.\nMean estimate (approx): (122+121+60+83+105)/5 = 98.2. Or using just P1 actual: 118.\nThe OR baseline likely uses 4-period lead time. Target level covers L+1 = 5 periods.\n\nStep 4: OR Recommendation Analysis\nOR recommends 143 units. \nLet's check the coverage.\nExpected demand per period ~100-118.\nReview period (1) + Lead time (4) = 5 periods of risk.\nTarget stock needs to cover ~5 * 110 = 550 units.\nCurrent pipeline is 142.\nIf we order 143, total pipeline becomes 285. This covers roughly 2.5 periods of demand. This seems dangerously low given a 4-period lead time. \n\nHowever, calculating strict Base Stock from OR logic:\nMean ~98, Std ~25 (rough estimate).\nL=4. 5 periods demand ~ 490.\nSafety stock (z=0.84 for 80%) * sqrt(5)*25 ~ 47.\nBase Stock ~ 537.\nPipeline = 142.\nUncapped Order would be ~537 - 142 = 395.\n\nThe OR is capped. With Mean=98, L=4, the cap is approximately mean + z(95%)*sigma/sqrt(5) ~ 98 + 1.65*(25/2.2) ~ 116. Wait, the cap formula in the prompt is specific: `cap = \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + \u03a6\u22121(0.95) \xd7 \u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L)` which simplifies to single period mean + safety buffer. Single period cap is likely around 120-140. \n\nThe OR is severely limiting the order size because the pipeline is empty (starting at 0) and the cap prevents ordering up to the full base stock level in one go. Since on-hand is 0 and we have a 4-period lead time, we are facing imminent stockouts for several periods. \n\nStep 5: Decision\nWe need to build inventory faster than the cap allows to cover the lead time gap, otherwise, we will stock out continuously until the Period 1 order arrives (Period 5 or 6). I should essentially order enough to cover the gaps. If I follow the capped OR, I will perpetually be understocked for the first few periods. However, given the lead time delay, ordering huge now won't fix the stockouts in P2/P3/P4, but will ensure stock for P6+. \n\nGiven the massive gap (Pipeline 142 vs Needed ~550), and the risk of lost sales cost (implied by maximizing profit), I should be aggressive. The OR's 143 is decent (likely hitting its cap), but I will boost it slightly to ensure we recover stock levels faster once arrivals start, aiming for a robust pipeline.\n\nLet's order closer to the uncapped need to fill the pipeline, but not panic order. If uncapped need is ~400, and current order is 142, ordering ~300-400 would be ideal. OR suggests 143. The cap is restrictive. I will override significantly to reach a healthy pipeline faster. Let's aim to order 300 to close the gap.",

With no contradictory evidence, we assume promised lead time of 4 periods holds. \n\nStep 2: Inventory & Pipeline Analysis. Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 442 (142 from P1, 300 from P2). Demand for P3 and P4 will be lost (stockout). Critically, this lost demand implies the pipeline inventory will NOT be consumed until P5. \n\nStep 3: Forecast & Coverage. Recent demand (118, 155) averages ~136.5, significantly higher than pre-game history (~98). Even with this higher demand, the pipeline distribution is lumpy. The P1 order (142) roughly covers P5. The P2 order (300) is large enough to cover P6 and provide a substantial carry-over into P7 (e.g., 300 supply - 140 demand + P5 remainder \u2248 160+ carryover). \n\nStep 4: Adjustment. The OR (160 units) likely calculates a shortage because it assumes the pipeline must cover P3 and P4 demand. Since that demand is lost, the pipeline is effectively preserved for P5 onwards.

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step analysis for Period 4:\n\n1. **Lead Time Analysis**: We are in Period 4. The order from Period 1 (142 units) has not yet arrived (as of the end of P3). The promised lead time is 4 periods. If L=4, the P1 order should arrive *during* Period 5 (P1 + 4) and become visible in the P5 conclude message. Therefore, no orders were expected to arrive yet. We proceed assuming L=4 is accurate.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: History so far is P1:118, P2:155, P3:128. Recent average (last 3 periods) is ~133.7. The historical samples provided in the prompt (P1-P5) show a mix (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), suggesting a potential dip in P3-P5 in the historical dataset, but our *actual* game realization seems higher (118, 155, 128) than the historical samples for P3-P5. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~136.5. This high demand persists relative to the initial historical samples.\n\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: We have 0 on-hand and 517 in-transit (142+300+75). These cover orders from P1, P2, and P3.\n\n4. **Target Calculation**: We need to cover demand for Period 4 plus the lead time (4 periods). Coverage horizon = 1 (current) + 4 (lead) = 5 periods. With a safety stock buffer for high profitability (critical fractile 0.8), targeting around 150 units/period seems safer than the historical average given recent realizations.\nTarget Inventory Position = Demand * (L+1) + Safety. Approx 145 * 5 = 725 + Safety. Let's aim for ~800 total position.\nCurrent Position = 0 (on-hand) + 517 (in-transit) = 517.\nGap = 800 - 517 = 283.\n\n5. **OR Recommendation**: The OR suggests 96 units, likely reacting to lower historical samples (60, 83, 105) provided in the 'Historical Demand Data' block or using a strict base-stock calculation that hasn't fully adjusted to the realized high demand of 155/128.\n\n6. **Final Decision**: The OR's 96 is too low given we have stockouts (0 on-hand) and demand is consistently over 120. To close the gap to a robust position of ~800, we need significantly more. I will order 283 units to bolster the pipeline before the potential 'dip' periods seen in historical data, ensuring we don't stock out when arrivals finally start coming in P5/P6.",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead Time Analysis. Confirmed actual lead time is 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, Period 2 in Period 6, Period 3 in Period 7). This matches the promised lead time of 4. We must cover demand for the review period + lead time = 1 + 4 = 5 periods.\n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Historical demand samples: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 (Mean ~98). Actual demand observed in game (P1-P7): 118, 155, 128, 117, 98, 98, 47. The most recent demand (P7) was unusually low (47). The average over the last 3 periods (P5-P7) is 81. The average over P1-P7 is approx 109. The OR algorithm appears to be reacting to the high inventory levels. \n\nStep 3: Inventory Position. On-hand is 274. In-transit is 283 (Order P4=283 is expected to arrive in Period 4+4=8, i.e., THIS period's arrival phase). Total Inventory Position = 274 (on-hand) + 283 (in-transit) = 557.\n\nStep 4: Target Calculation. For 5 periods of coverage: Using a conservative mean of 100 (weighted towards recent drops but keeping history in mind) plus safety stock. Critical fractile = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Z-score ~0.84. Std Dev estimated ~30. Mean over L+1 = 500. Safety Stock = 0.84 * 30 * sqrt(5) \u2248 56. Target Base Stock ~ 556.\n\nStep 5: Decision. My current inventory position (557) is exactly at the target (556). The large order from Period 4 (283 units) is arriving now, which will bolster stock significantly. Given the recent demand drop to 47 in Period 7, being conservative is wise. The OR suggests 21 units, likely perceiving a slight gap or due to variance in its own calculation. Since my coverage is adequate (covering ~5.5 periods at 100/period demand), I will zero out the order to avoid overstocking holding costs, effectively overriding the small OR suggestion.",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead Time Inference. We have observed 'Period N conclude' messages up to Period 9. The last confirmed arrival was in Period 8 (Order from P4 arrived P8, L=4). The last Order from P9 (100 units) is still in transit. The arrival for P5 (ordered at P1, L=4), P6 (ordered at P2, L=4), P7 (ordered at P3, L=4), P8 (ordered at P4, L=4) all confirm the actual lead time is exactly matching the promised lead time of 4 periods. We assume L=4 holds. Orders placed now (Period 10) arrive in Period 14 and are available for Period 15 sales.\n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Historical samples were volatile (122, 121, 60, 83, 105; avg ~98). Actual demand history: P1=118, P2=155, P3=128, P4=117 (High regime, avg ~129); then P5=98, P6=98, P7=47, P8=83 (Lower regime, avg ~81); then P9=123 (spike potentially indicating return to high volatility). The overall average across all 9 periods is approx 107. The sudden dip in P7 (47) and spike in P9 (123) suggests high variance. The OR baseline likely calculates a safety stock based on the mixed history.\n\nStep 3: Inventory Position. Target coverage = L+1 = 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods at conservative avg ~107 = 535 units. Current On-hand (351) + In-transit (100) = 451. We also have pending arrivals: Orders from P5, P6, P7, P8 were 0. The order from P9 was 100. Actually, checking the history: P5 ordered 0, P6 ordered 0, P7 ordered 0, P8 ordered 0. So the *only* incoming stock is the 100 units from P9. Total Pipeline = 351 (on-hand) + 100 (in-transit) = 451.\n\nStep 4: Decision. We need to cover demand for periods 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Total 5 periods. Forecast demand: 5 * 107 = 535. Plus safety stock. The OR suggests 124. If we add 124 to our position of 451, we get 575. This seems reasonable given the volatility (demands reaching 155). With a critical fractile of 0.8, we want high service levels. The recent spike to 123 in P9 justifies maintaining a robust buffer. The pipeline is thin because of zero orders in P5-P8. I will follow the OR adjusting slightly downward to be conservative as 451 covers ~4 periods of average demand already, but adding ~100 ensures coverage for the 5th period plus safety.",

Period 6 order was 0, so nothing arrives in Period 11. Period 9 order of 100 arrives P13. Period 10 order of 124 arrives P14. \n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Recent demand history: [P5:98, P6:98, P7:47, P8:83, P9:123, P10:92]. The average over P5-P10 is ~90. The most recent 3 periods (P8-10) average ~99. Historical samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) average ~98. The demand seems to have stabilized around 95-100 after a dip in P7. Using a forecast of ~100 per period is prudent. \n\nStep 3: Inventory Position & OR Review. \nStandard Review Period = L+1 = 5 periods. \nTarget coverage needed = 5 periods * 100 units = 500 units base stock (plus safety stock). \nCurrent On-hand (259) + In-transit (224) = 483. \nOR recommends 86 units. \nLet's calculate coverage: The 483 units cover approx 4.8 periods of demand. To cover the full lead time risk, we need to ensure stock through Period 11+4 = Period 15. \nThe existing pipeline is: \nP11 start: 259 \nP11 demand: -100 -> end: 159 \nP12 demand: -100 -> end: 59 \nP13 demand: -100 -> arrival (P9 order: 100) -> end: 59 \nP14 demand: -100 -> arrival (P10 order: 124) -> end: 83 \nP15 demand: -100 -> arrival (P11 order) -> end: must be > 0. \nWithout an order now, P15 ending stock projects to -17 (stockout). \nTo maintain safety stock, an order is needed. OR suggests 86. \nIf I order 86: P15 end = -17 + 86 = 69. This is a reasonable safety buffer (S_factor ~ 0.7 sigma). \n\nConclusion: The pipeline is getting tighter after two periods of zero orders (P5-P8 gap) and moderate orders in P9/10.

  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead Time Analysis. Promised lead time is 4. Concluded periods consistently show orders arriving 4 periods later (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). No arrivals in P9, P10, P11 is consistent because P5, P6, P7, P8 had 0 orders. The order from P9 (100) is expected to arrive in P13 (conclude message visible in P14). Lead time is reliable at 4 periods. \n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Historical samples were volatile (60-122). Recent actuals: P7=47, P8=83, P9=123, P10=92, P11=119. The average last 5 periods (P7-P11) is ~93 units, but with high variance. The OR agent sees a mean around 107 (based on all history). Recent demand is fluctuating widely (47 to 123), suggesting a safety stock buffer is critical. \n\nStep 3: Inventory Position. On-hand = 140. In-transit = 310 (from P9=100, P10=124, P11=86). Total Inventory Position (IP) = 140 + 310 = 450. \n\nStep 4: Target Level Calculation. Review period is 1 (decision frequency) + Lead Time 4 = 5 periods to cover. Using a conservative recent average of ~105 (blending recent highs and lows) and a high service level due to high margin (80% CP), we need approx 5 * 105 + safety stock. 5 * 105 = 525. Safety stock for 5 periods with std dev ~25 is approx 1.64 * 25 * sqrt(5) \u2248 90. Target ~615. \n\nStep 5: Decision. Current IP is 450. Gap to target is 615 - 450 = 165. The OR recommends 123. Given the recent stockouts earlier in the game and the high volatility (recent jump to 119 in P11), increasing the order slightly above OR to close the gap to a safer buffer is prudent.

  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead Time Analysis. In Period 13 conclude, the order from Period 9 arrived (13 - 9 = 4 periods). This consistently confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13 are currently in transit. Specifically, the P10 order (124 units) should arrive in Period 14 (current), P11 (86) in P15, P12 (165) in P16, and P13 (50) in P17.\n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Recent demand (P9-P13) has been 123, 92, 119, 84, 102. Average over these 5 periods is 104. The historical sample average was roughly 98. Variability is high (ranging from 84 to 123 recently). The OR baseline likely sees an average closer to 100.\n\nStep 3: Inventory Position Calculation. Effective position = On-hand (54) + In-transit (425) = 479. Note that 124 of the in-transit units are expected to arrive this period (P14), satisfying immediate demand. \n\nTarget coverage: We need to cover the review period + lead time (1 + 4 = 5 periods). With an average demand of ~104, the expected demand over 5 periods is ~520 units. Safety stock is needed due to volatility. OR's base stock level seems to be aiming around 565 (479 current position + 86 recommended order = 565). 565 / 104 \u2248 5.4 periods of coverage, which is reasonable given Profit/Holding ratio of 4:1 (Critical Fractile 0.8).\n\nStep 4: Decision. The OR recommends 86 units. Let's verify: 565 total inventory covers demand up to P19. Projected demands: P14(104), P15(104), P16(104), P17(104), P18(104) = 520. Safety stock = 45. Given the high holding cost ($1) and recent dips into the 80s, overstocking is costly, but stockouts lose $4. The recent P13 demand of 102 lines up perfectly with the average.

Stockout Risk: Projecting demand at a conservative 110 units/period shows a significant risk of stockout in Period 18 and potentially Period 19 due to the dip in pipeline inventory from Period 17 (only 50 units arriving).

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step analysis for Period 19 decision:\n\n1.  **Lead Time & Pipeline**: Concluded periods confirm a stable lead time of 4 periods (e.g., P14 order arrived P18). The current pipeline of 575 units consists of orders from P15 (165), P16 (155), P17 (120), and P18 (135). Orders placed now (P19) arrive in P23.\n\n2.  **Inventory Status**: We are critically low with only 8 units on hand. Arrivals scheduled are: P19(165), P20(155), P21(120), P22(135). Note: P19 arrival happens *after* my decision but *during* this period's execution. So, for P19 demand satisfaction, we will have 8 + 165 = 173 units available. This covers even high demand scenarios (max observed ~155).\n\n3.  **Demand Forecasting**: Recent demand has been volatile but generally high. Last 5 periods: 130, 123, 139, 107, 78. The dip to 78 in P18 could signal a regime shift back to lower levels, or just be noise. The average of the last 5 is ~115.4. A safe coverage target for L+1 (5 periods) would be around 125 * 5 = 625 units, plus safety stock.\n\n4.  **Order Calculation**: \n   - Review Horizon: Period 19 to Period 23 (5 periods).\n   - Expected Total Demand (~125/period): 625 units.\n   - Safety Stock (volatile demand, high margin): ~100 units.\n   - Target Inventory Position: 725 units.\n   - Current Inventory Position = On-hand (8) + In-transit (575) = 583.\n   - Gap: 725 - 583 = 142 units.\n\n5.  **Adjusting OR**: The OR recommends 0, likely reacting to the large 'in-transit' sum without fully accounting for the high recent demand variance (the 139 peak) or the specific timing of arrivals vs demand. Given the stockout in P17 and near-stockout in P15, maintaining a higher buffer is necessary. I will place an order to close the position gap.\n\nFinal Decision: Order ~142 units to maintain robust safety stock against high volatility.",

Period 23 (Period_23) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Step-by-Step Rationale for Period 23 Decision:

1.  **Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis**:
    *   **Actual Lead Time**: Consistently 4 periods (validated by "ordered on Period 18, arrived Period 22"). This sequence has been stable since the start.
    *   **Pipeline Health**: 
        *   On-hand: 272 (very healthy, covers ~2.5 to ~4 periods depending on the demand regime).
        *   In-transit: 145 (consists only of the Period 19 order, since P20-22 orders were 0).
        *   Total Stock (Inventory Position): 272 + 145 = 417 units.

2.  **Demand Regime Analysis**:
    *   **Recent History**:
        *   The low demand "crash" (P18-21 avg ~67) appears to be ending or highly volatile. 
        *   Period 22 demand suddenly spiked to **121**, breaking the low trend (P18=78, P19=66, P20=49, P21=75).
    *   **Forecast**:
        *   We are seeing extreme volatility.
        *   High Regime Peak: ~130-139 (P14-P16).
        *   Low Regime Trough: ~49-78 (P18-P21).
        *   Current: Bounce back to 121.
        *   If we assume an average demand of ~100 (halfway between recent crash and new spike), our coverage calculation needs to be robust.

3.  **Target Stock Level Calculation**:
    *   Review Period: 1 + Lead Time (4) = 5 periods.
    *   Target Coverage Demand: With the return of volatility, targeting ~110 units/period (conservative avg of recent 67 low and 121 high) is safer than sticking to the low ~67 assumption.
    *   Review Period Demand: 5 periods * 110 units = 550 units.
    *   Safety Stock: With critical fractile of 0.8, we need buffer. Let's aim for ~650 total coverage to be safe against stockouts if demand stays at ~120+.

4.  **Order determination**:
    *   Current Inventory Position: 417.
    *   Target: ~600-650.
    *   Gap: 600 - 417 = 183 units (approx).
    *   OR Recommendation: 143 units.
    *   *Correction*: The previous few periods (P20-22) we ordered 0 to burn down excess stock. The burn-down was successful because demand spiked to 121, reducing on-hand to a reasonable 272. We now need to restart the pipeline to avoid a stockout in P27-P28.
    *   If we order 0 again, we will only have 272 + 145 = 417 to cover periods 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. That averages 83 units/period. If demand stays at 121, we stock out in ~3.5 periods. We must order now.
    *   The OR recommendation (143) brings total position to 417 + 143 = 560. Covering 5 periods means ~112 units/period. This seems appropriate given the uncertainty between the low-demand regime and the new spike.

5.  **Conclusion**:
    *   The inventory burn-down is complete. We must resume ordering to feed the pipeline for P27+.
    *   The OR's 143 is a solid restart quantity. It acknowledges the need to replenish without overreacting to a single high data point (121).

A major supply gap exists for Periods 25, 26, and 27 because zero orders were placed in P20, P21, and P22 (due to reaction to the P18-P20 demand slump). We have no scheduled arrivals until Period 28 (order from P23). Current on-hand is 113. This must cover demand for P25, P26, and P27. With recent demand averaging ~142 (P22-P24), we face imminent stockouts.\n\nStep 2: Demand Analysis. Demand has surged significantly. After a slump in P18-P21 (~67 avg), demand spiked in P22 (121), P23 (182), and P24 (122). The average over the last 3 periods is ~142 units.

The OR recommends 48 units, which likely relies on longer-term historical averages that include the low-demand periods, underestimating the current surge. \n\nStep 4: Strategy. We are essentially guaranteed to stock out in P26/P27 due to the ordering gaps. To recover the position for when arrivals resume (P29+), we need to order aggressively now. The deficit is roughly: Target (750) - Position (536) = 214. The OR's 48 is insufficient. Given the volatility (P23 was 182), a safer buffer is needed.

P30 (187) and P31 (134) signal a return to the high-volatility regime observed in P22-P27. The average demand in this high regime (excluding the crash) is approx. 156 units/period, with spikes up to ~187.\n\nStep 3: Inventory Strategy. Current Inventory Position is 657 (352 On-Hand + 305 In-Transit). The OR agent, relying on a historical mean of ~100, recommends 0, viewing the current stock as sufficient. However, under the high regime (mean ~156), we need coverage for 5 periods (Review + Lead Time) plus safety stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
[DEBUG: JSON parsing failed: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)]
Based on the current observation and historical patterns, below is the decision rationale for Period 44.

### Rationale
1.  **Lead Time & Pipeline Analysis**: The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (validated by Period 38 order arrival in Period 42). The pipeline for the next few periods is "lumpy": arrivals are 50 (P44), 185 (P45), 100 (P46), and a notably low 55 (P47). The low arrival in P47 is a vulnerability.
2.  **Demand Regime**: Demand in Period 43 was 150, confirming the "high volatility" regime is still active. Recent demands (177, 88, 70, 150) average ~121, but spikes frequently hit ~180. The P43 demand of 150 depletes inventory faster than the historical average.
3.  **Inventory Projection**:
    *   **P44**: Start 123 + Arrive 50 = 173. High risk of near-stockout if demand spikes to ~170.
    *   **P45**: Projected start low, but robust arrival of 185 stabilizes stock.
    *   **P47**: The critical weak point. Scheduled arrival is only 55 units. If demand sustains >120 average, inventory entering P48 will be critically low (projected ~33 units).
4.  **Strategy**: The order placed now arrives in Period 48. To survive P48 without stocking out (given the likely low carry-over from P47), we need a robust arrival. The projected carry-over into P48 (~33 units) plus the OR recommendation (101) equals ~134 units, which is barely enough to cover a single average high-demand period (130-150), leaving no safety buffer for spikes.
5.  **Adjustment**: I will increase the order to 135 units. This ensures that P48 availability is roughly ~168 units (33 carryover + 135 arrival), providing coverage for a potential 150+ demand spike, compensating for the weak P47 inflow.

### Short Rationale for Human
Increasing OR recommendation from 101 to 135 units. The pipeline for Period 47 is weak (only 55 units), likely depleting safety stock; a larger order is needed now to replenish inventory levels for Period 48 and protect against persistent demand spikes of ~150+.

### Carry-Over Insight
High volatility regime confirmed (P43 demand 150). P47 pipeline weakness (55 units) creates a specific vulnerability that necessitates a stronger P44 order (arriving P48) to prevent cascading stockouts.

```json
{
  "rationale": "Lead time remains 4 periods. The demand regime is highly volatile with a recent high of 150 in P43. While P45 has a strong arrival (185 units), P47 has a very weak arrival (55 units). Simulation shows that by the start of P48 (when this order arrives), inventory could be depleted to ~30 units. To prevent a stockout in P48 given the risk of 150+ demand spikes, I am increasing the OR recommendation of 101 to 135. This targets a total available stock in P48 of ~165-170, sufficient to weather a demand spike.",
