Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No history is available yet for lead times or demand in this session, so I must rely on the provided historical samples (P1-P5) from the preprompt. The samples are [118, 124, 116, 96, 91]. The trend appears slightly downward, but with only 5 samples, a simple average of the last few is safest or using the provided full history. Average of these 5 samples is (118+124+116+96+91)/5 = 545/5 = 109. Since I am in Period 1, I have no internal observation history yet, so I will select 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the provided sample average to bootstrap the process. For L, I must stick to the promised lead time (4 periods) as there are no concluded orders to calculate from. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of the provided samples is approx 13.9, so I will use that.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 2. The observation shows Period 1 demand was 102, which is close to the historical mean. The historical samples provided (Period_1=118, Period_2=124, Period_3=116, Period_4=96, Period_5=91) suggest a downward trend in the simulated history, but the actual realized demand in Period 1 (102) aligns loosely with this. The in-transit inventory is 132 (ordered in P1). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals are expected until Period 5 (arriving at end of P5, visible start of P6). We have no actual lead time observations yet, so we trust the promised lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, we will use the most recent 5 historical samples provided in the prompt context plus the 1 realized period to get a balanced view, or simply stick to the historical average given the small sample size of realized data. Given the historical samples show a trend, 'recent_N' with N=5 covering the provided history is a safe baseline. However, the realized P1 demand (102) is centered within the historical range. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat as we lack sufficient realized history to justify a deviation from the overall historical statistics provided in the prompt.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 3. We have observed 2 periods of demand (102, 87), averaging 94.5, which is lower than the provided pre-game historical average of ~109. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (0.8), we maintain a slightly conservative forecast above recent actulas but below historical peaks to prevent stockouts while acknowledging the lower trend. We estimate mean demand ~100/period. With a lead time of 4 periods (horizon R+L=5), the target protection level is calculated explicitly. No arrivals are expected yet, so default lead time is used.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 4. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (Period 1 order expected to arrive in Period 5). In-transit inventory matches sum of orders (132+130+124=386). Observed demand (102, 87, 126) averages ~105, which is consistent with the provided historical samples but reflects live volatility. I will use 'recent_N' (N=3) for demand parameters to capture the current fluctuation and set base stock levels. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as no capability to observe arrivals or deviations exists yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 5. No arrivals observed yet, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (Period 1 order arrives in Period 5, visible in P5 conclude). Realized demand over periods 1-4 (avg ~101, sigma ~18) is lower and more volatile than the provided historical samples (avg ~109). Given the high Critical Ratio of 0.8 ($4 profit vs $1 holding), stockouts are costly. I am selecting 'recent_N=4' for demand parameters to calibrate to the actual game realizations and volatility while ensuring the base stock calculation covers the variance observed in the last 4 periods. The pipeline (524 units) covers the expected mean demand over the review+lead time horizon (approx 500 units), so the replenished order will primarily build safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 6. We have 5 periods of observed game history. Demand is volatile (range 87-126) with an average of ~103.6. I am using the most recent 5 periods (observed game history) for demand estimation rather than the pre-game samples, as the game realization differs. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the Period 1 order arriving in Period 5. Pipeline inventory (406 units) matches the sum of outstanding orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5, indicating no lost orders. I will use N=5 to capture the full observed history for demand mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Realized demand (P1-P6) averages ~101 units with sigma ~16, slightly lower than pre-game historical samples (~109). We use recent_N=6 to align forecast with the active game regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P2 order arrived in P6, confirming LT=4). Pipeline inventory (403) exactly matches sum of orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6, confirming no lost orders. Current on-hand (59) + in-transit (403) = 462 IP. With 5-period protection interval (L=4), target base stock is ~530 (505 demand + SS), so a top-up order is expected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P3 order arrived P7), matching the promised lead time, so L='default' is used. Demand over the last 7 periods (avg ~97.4) is slightly lower than the initial historical seed data (~109) but exhibits volatility (std dev ~17.7). To reflect the actual game dynamics rather than the seed data, I am using 'recent_N' (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This sets a base stock covering the (L+1)=5 period risk horizon based on the full observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of concluded periods confirms consistent 4-period lead time behavior (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4 arrived in P5, P6, P7, P8 respectively). This stability allows us to rely on default lead time settings. Demand history shows recent fluctuation: P4=88, P5=115, P6=88, P7=76, P8=95. The average demand across all periods (approx 97) is reasonable, but recent signals lean slightly lower (avg last 3 = 86.3). However, given the volatility (76 to 115 recently), a broader average is safer than reacting too quickly to the dip in P7. I will stick to 'default' parameters for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, which utilize the full history to smooth out noise, as there is no strong evidence of a permanent regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 10. Actual lead time has consistently been confirmed as 4 periods (promised: 4) in all conclude messages (P5 to P9), so I will maintain L='default'. Demand analysis reveals a downward trend: the average demand for the first 5 periods (P1-P5) was ~103, while the most recent 4 periods (P6-P9) averaged ~84. To avoid overstocking in this lower-demand regime while maintaining a high service level (critical ratio ~0.8), I will switch to using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent range (avg ~90.2) rather than the higher global average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Avg demand P6-P9 (84) is ~18% lower than P1-P5 (103)

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 11. Lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (Order from Period 6 arrived in Period 10 start). Demand remains in the lower regime defined since Period 6, with the average over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) being approx 86.4 units, compared to the initial average of ~103. Current on-hand (118) plus in-transit (268) totals 386. To cover the 5-period risk horizon (4 lead + 1 review) at the current lower demand rate, I will use recent_N=5 adjustments for demand parameters. This ensures the target stock level reflects the recent consumption drop (~86/period) rather than the older high average, optimizing holding costs.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (promised = actual), so we use 'default' for L. The demand regime shift observed starting in Period 6 continues to hold; demand for Periods 6-11 averages ~85 units, significantly below the early game average (>100). Period 11 demand (78) confirms this lower trend. We select 'recent_N' with N=6 for both estimated mean and volatility to base forecasts strictly on this ongoing lower-demand regime (P6-P11) and avoid overstocking based on outdated high demand. All in-transit orders are accounted for.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P12). Demand in P12 (90) aligns with the lower regime observed since P6 (average ~86 units, compared to >100 in early periods). We continue to use recent history (N=7) for demand parameters to filter out the early high-demand noise and accurately reflect the current lower mean and volatility. Lead time parameter set to recent_N to maintain adaptivity.

LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~91 avg) since Period 6 compared to the early game (~103), though P13 showed a slight spike (110). Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat filters out the high-demand early regime to prevent over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the 0.8 critical ratio.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 decision. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (observed consistently from P5 to P14 arrivals). Demand analysis confirms the regime shift detected earlier (starting P6) persists: average demand from P6-P14 is ~88 units, which is significantly lower than the P1-P5 average of ~103 units, despite a solitary spike in P13 (110). Using recent_N=9 (periods 6-14) for demand parameters isolates this stable lower-demand regime and excludes the initialization high-demand noise. Current inventory position (OH=26, IT=336, Total=362) is below the target base stock (approx ~440+), prompting a replenishment order to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 resulted in a stockout (112 demand vs 90 avail). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand in the last 5 periods (avg 94.4) has risen compared to the prev dip (avg 86.4), with spikes of 110 and 112. Switching to recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this rebound and buffer against the recent high variance to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebounding: Avg demand P11-P15 (94.4) increased from P6-P10 (86.4), approaching initial levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 for the second consecutive period, indicating under-stocking amidst a recovering demand signal. While lead time remains stable at 4 periods, demand volatility has increased significantly in the last 6 periods (ranging from 78 to 112), averaging ~91.6. This confirms the rebound from the previous low regime (avg 86.4). To recover service levels and cover the L+1 risk period, I am using recent_N=6 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the higher average and increased variance of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility high in rebound phase: P11-P16 ranges 78-112 (std dev ~15.6), destabilizing forecast accuracy compared to prior smooth regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: On-hand inventory is 39, with a healthy pipeline of 396 units arriving over the next 4 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 53 (a historic low), sharply contradicting the 'rebound' trend observed in previous periods. This high volatility (swinging from 112 in P15 to 53 in P17) suggests determining a stable mean is difficult. We switch to a recent_N=5 approach for both mean and standard deviation to responsibly weight this new low observation while maintaining the higher context of periods 13-15. This naturally increases safety stock (via sigma) to buffer against the unpredictability, which is vital given the high stockout cost relative to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash in P17 (53 units, historic low) invalidates simple rebound theory; high volatility is now the dominant regime (P13-P17 range: 53-112).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 demand plummeted to 30 units, a new historic low following the Period 17 crash (53 units). This confirms a steep downward trend rather than mere volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory (118) and a large pipeline (334) far exceeding the new low demand levels (approx 54 avg over last 3 periods), the priority is to halt ordering and reduce stock. I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to rapidly incorporate this lower demand signal (avg ~54) and prevent overstocking. Sigma_hat captures the recent instability with N=5.

Carry-over insight: Demand free-fall verified: Period 18 dropped to 30 units (lowest ever), confirming the crash trend started in P17 (53). Regime has shifted to extreme low demand (avg last 3 periods: ~54).

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has crashed and appears to be stabilizing at a new, much lower level (P17: 53, P18: 30, P19: 50). The average over the last 3 periods is ~44.3 units, significantly down from the historical average of ~100. 

Inventory status: We have a massive overstock situation. On-hand (168) + In-transit (234) = 402 total units. With a lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5 periods coverage needed), and demand ~45, we only need ~225 units. We have nearly double what is required.

Parameters: 
1. L='default' (4) as lead times remain stable.
2. mu_hat='recent_N' (N=3) to aggressively align the forecast with the new 'extreme low' regime (~44 units), ensuring the base stock calculation drops low enough to trigger zero orders.
3. sigma_hat='recent_N' (N=5) to retain some volatility awareness from the crash transition, although the primary goal is inventory reduction.

Carry-over insight: Demand low floor detected: P17-P19 avg is 44.3 units, stabilizing after P18 low (30). High inventory levels (402 total pipeline) necessitate continued zero orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $141.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21. Promised lead time remains reliable at 4 periods (validated by P20 conclude message). Inventory position is 316 (203 on-hand + 113 in-transit). Demand history shows extreme volatility: a crash from P16 (78) down to P18 (30), followed by a sharp rebound in P20 (86). The recent demand pattern (30, 50, 86) suggests the 'low floor' hypothesis was premature or demand is highly unstable. Given the high cost of stockout ($4) vs holding ($1), relying on the crash average (~45) is risky if demand sustains the recovery to ~86. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma. This window (P16-P20: 78, 53, 30, 50, 86; Avg ~59.4) captures the full volatility cycle\u2014the descent and the recovery\u2014resulting in a conservative mean but a high variance estimate. This high variance increases safety stock, hedging against the stockout risk without aggressively overcommitting if the crash resumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signal in P20 (86 units) challenges previous low-demand trend (P17-P19 avg ~44). Volatility confirmed as dominant regime (P16-P20 range: 30-86).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current pipeline (274 units) covers approx. 3.6 periods of recent average demand (~76), which is below the L+1=5 period coverage target, indicating a risk of future stockout as we move away from the demand crash. Observed demand in P21 (66) confirms the recovery trend started in P20 (86), creating a new 'post-crash' demand context averaging ~76 units (P20-P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P17 order arrived P21). I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand parameters. This window (P12-P21) balances the recent recovery against the preceding crash, resulting in a moderate mean forecast (~76) but high variance estimates, which appropriately boosts safety stock in this volatile, high-margin context (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Post-crash recovery sustained: Avg demand P20-P21 (76) significantly exceeds P17-P19 crash avg (44), confirming a shift away from the low-demand trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand dropped significantly to 37, invalidating the recovery theory suggested by P20-P21 and confirming continued extreme volatility (regime range 30-86). The 6-period average is now ~54 units. Total inventory (on-hand 213 + in-transit 143 = 356) is very high relative to this mean (covering >6 periods), suggesting an overstock risk. I am setting N=6 to capture the full scope of this volatile low-demand regime (P17-P22) and prevent unnecessary ordering until stock levels align with the lower average demand.

Carry-over insight: False recovery signal: P22 demand dropped to 37, contradicting P20-P21 rise. Regime remains highly volatile with low average (P17-P22 avg ~54).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-113.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 decision. Demand in Period 23 dropped to a new historic low of 20 units, confirming that the recovery seen in Periods 20-21 was transient. The current market regime is extremely volatile with a sharp downward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is only 41 units. With a current inventory position of 336 units (193 on-hand + 143 in-transit), we are significantly overstocked relative to this new low demand level (approx 8 periods of coverage). I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to rapidly adjust the forecast to the crashing demand (~41), ensuring the system halts ordering to burn off excess inventory. I am keeping sigma_hat at 'recent_N' with N=5 to retain a wider volatility buffer (accounting for the spike in P20) in case demand oscillates back up, preventing stockouts if the crash is just noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand crash deepens with historic low (20 units) in P23. Short-term average (P21-P23: ~41) confirms critical low-demand regime, overriding the P20-P21 recovery signal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. Demand remains in a depressed regime; Period 24 demand (36) and Period 23 (20) confirm a low baseline, with the last 5 periods averaging ~49 units (inflated by a spike in P20). Current total pipeline inventory is 300 units (157 on-hand + 143 in-transit). Even with a conservative demand estimate of 50/units per period over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), we have nearly 6 periods of stock coverage. The strategy is to halt ordering to allow inventory to drain. I will use 'recent_N' (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the current volatility and low mean, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock well below our current position.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime stabilization: Average demand P21-P24 is ~40 units, significantly below historical norms. Current inventory pipeline (300) provides excess coverage (~7+ periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 26. Demand has stabilized in a low-volume regime (P21-P25 average ~42 units), significantly below the historical high of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P25 concluded P21 order exactly on time). Current pipeline inventory (249 units) exceeds the target coverage for the 5-period protection interval (~210 units needed at current demand rates). I am selecting 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu and sigma to tightly align the forecast with the current low demand (~42 avg) and volatility (~17 std dev), ensuring the system calculates a base stock (~242) below current inventory (249) to force a zero order and allow excess stock to burn off.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27. Pipeline inventory is depleted (In-transit=0), and On-hand (197) provides <4 periods of coverage given the recovering demand (P25-P26 avg ~51.5). The previous 'low' plateau (~40 units) has been superseded by recent data, suggesting a mean closer to ~50. I am switching to active replenishment parameters. I selected N=7 (P20-P26) to capture the full volatility of the current regime (ranging from 20 to 86) and the mean (~50), ensuring sufficient base stock to rebuild the pipeline against a Stockout risk in periods P30-P31.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Avg demand P25-P26 (51.5) has broken above the P21-P24 stabilization level (~40), indicating a new mean ~50.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand recovery is sustained with Period 27 at 58 units, raising the 3-period average to ~53.7. This confirms the exit from the crash regime (P23-24 lows). Current total inventory (139 on-hand + 86 in-transit = 225) covers ~4.2 periods of demand, just under the target of 5 periods (Lead Time 4 + Review 1), triggering a replenishment order. We use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to align quickly with the new stable demand level (~50-60 range) and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to include the recent volatility (P22-24) in the safety stock calculation, hedging against potential instability.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 29. Observation reveals a stable 'Low-Medium' demand regime over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), with demand values [51, 52, 58, 48] averaging ~52.25 units. This consistency (low standard deviation) suggests the system has settled after the P23 crash, maintaining a mean significantly lower than the P1-P15 historic levels but higher than the P23 trough. With a pipeline of 247 units and a lead time of 4 periods, current coverage is approx 4.7 periods of demand (247/52.25), close to the target of 5 periods (L+1). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to aligning forecasting strictly with this new stable regime, minimizing holding costs while maintaining service for the ~52 unit mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization at ~52 units: P25-P28 avg is 52.3 with low variance, confirming a new steady regime after previous volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 demand (55) further confirms the stable regime established since Period 25. The 5-period average (P25-P29) is 52.8 units with low volatility, distinct from the prior crash and volatility. Current on-hand (36) is critically low for the immediate period, and while pipeline orders (179) are incoming, the total position (215) is insufficient to cover the 5-period horizon demand (~265 units). Using recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma accurately reflects the current stable conditions and will trigger a necessary replenishment order to restore coverage.

LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized in the 50-60 range (avg ~54 over last 6 periods), though an uptick to 62 in P30 caused a stockout. Pipeline is healthy (236 units), but immediate coverage is tight. Using recent_N=6 for both mean and sigma to align forecast with this post-crash stable regime, discarding older volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand recovery strengthening; P30 demand (62) is highest since P21, signaling potential drift upward from ~52 baseline.

We use recent_N=5 for demand and sigma to capture this specific volatile oscillation regime without being skewed by the deeper crash earlier or the historic highs.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand volatility persists; P31 dropped to 30 units immediately after P30 peak of 62. Short-term average (P27-P31) is ~49 units with high variance.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 33. Demand has exhibited extreme volatility, crashing from 62 in P30 to 30 in P31 and 24 in P32. The recent 'stabilization' around ~52 units has broken down. The average over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is 43.8, but with very high variance (range 24-62). Current total pipeline (on-hand 102 + in-transit 151 = 253) provides ~5.7 periods of coverage at this average, which is sufficient. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this specific high-volatility cluster, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the risk of upward spikes (like P30) while not over-ordering during the current lull. Lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed: P31-P32 avg (27) is ~50% of the P25-P30 stability level (~53). Extreme volatility dominates (P30 peak 62 vs P32 trough 24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 analysis: Demand in P33 was 63, a significant rebound from the P32 low of 24 and P31 low of 30. This creates a volatile oscillating pattern (62 -> 30 -> 24 -> 63). The 'crash' theory from P33 needs adjustment; rather than a sustained crash, we are seeing high-magnitude waves. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is ~46.8, but the variance is extreme (ranging 24 to 63). On-hand is 62, and pipeline is strong (128 units in transit). Historical lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high volatility, a 'recent_N' approach for mu and sigma is best to capture the fluctuations without overreacting to single data points. I will use N=6 to smooth the oscillating peaks and troughs (P28-P33 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as oscillating waves: Peaks ~63, Troughs ~24; average demand ~47 but highly unstable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-29.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 observations confirm a regime of extreme instability. Demand in Period 34 dropped to a historic low of 18 units, immediately following a peak of 63 in Period 33. This 'whipsaw' pattern (18-63 range) creates massive variance. Current pipeline (247 units) offers substantial coverage (~5 periods at average demand ~46), likely dampening the need for immediate large orders. I am selecting `recent_N=10` for mu_hat (approx 46) to bridge the gap between the stable period (P25-P29) and recent volatility, ensuring we don't under-react to potential peaks. For sigma_hat, I use `recent_N=5` to strictly capture the recent extreme standard deviation (~21) and enforce a robust safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme oscillating volatility intensifies with a new historic low (18 units) following a high peak (63), widening the amplitude range (18-63). Pattern suggests alternating high/low shocks rather than a stable mean.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 36. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P31 order arrived P35). Demand continues to exhibit extreme oscillating volatility, forming a 'sawtooth' pattern (P30-P35: 62, 30, 24, 63, 18, 60). The most recent period (P35) was a peak (60). The average over this volatile window (last 6 periods) is ~43 units with a high standard deviation (~19). The current pipeline (211) is roughly equal to expected mean demand over the protection interval (5 * 43 = 215), but additional safety stock is critical to cover the peaks (60+) given the high service level target (Profit/Holding = 4:1 implies 80% SL). We select N=6 for both mu and sigma to capture the full extent of this high-low oscillation without over-weighting just the most recent peak or trough.

Carry-over insight: Oscillating volatility persists P30-P35: demand alternates between peaks (~60-63) and deep troughs (~18-30), avg ~43 but std dev ~19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 on-hand (78) is sufficient for the expected 'peak' demand in the ongoing oscillating pattern (peaks ~62, troughs ~25), but the pipeline has a gap arriving in Period 38 (0 units ordered in P33). The oscillation pattern (High-Low) suggests P37 will be High (~60s), P38 Low (~20s), P39 High, etc. The order placed now arrives in P41, which is projected to be a High demand period. We use recent_N=7 (P30-P36) to capture the full amplitude of this volatility (Mean ~41.5, Sigma ~19.4) and ensure adequate safety stock to cover the peaks.

Carry-over insight: Oscillating volatility continues P30-P36: Alternating between peaks (~60-63) and troughs (~18-34). P36 (34) follows P35 (60), reinforcing the sawtooth pattern and suggesting P37 will likely be a peak.

This confirms the volatility regime is sustained, alternating between ~60+ and ~20-35. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is stabilizing around 45 units, despite the wild swings. P38 is expected to be a trough based on the pattern. On-hand inventory is critically low (9 units), though the P34 order (75 units) should arrive during this period (Lead Time 4 is consistent). Current Total Pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 176 units, which covers only ~3.9 periods of average demand (176 / 45), falling short of the required 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=8 for both mu and sigma to smooth out the extreme 2-period oscillations and capture the true underlying mean (~45) and the high variance (~20.5) necessary for adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Oscillating volatility confirmed P30-P37: Pattern of alternating peaks (~60-69) and troughs (~18-34) persists, with P37 peak (69). 8-period average stabilizes at ~45 units despite high variance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by P34 order arriving in P38). Demand pattern has shifted again: The 'sawtooth' oscillation (Peak-Trough) was disrupted in Period 38. After the P37 peak (69), demand did not crash to the ~20s as expected, but stayed high at 55. This suggests a regime shift towards a higher mean. The short-term average (last 4 periods) is 54.5, significantly higher than the volatility-dominated average of the prior window. Inventory is low (29 units) and pipeline (200) covers only ~3.6 periods of the new demand level (54.5), which is below the required coverage (L+1=5 periods). I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture this upward shift while retaining some awareness of recent volatility, prioritizing service level given the high stockout cost.

Carry-over insight: Oscillation disrupted in P38: Demand (55) remained high after P37 peak (69), defying previous 'sawtooth' crash pattern. Short-term avg (P35-P38) rose to 54.5, suggesting stabilization at higher levels.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Date: Period_40). Major regime shift confirmed: The previous 'sawtooth' volatility (alternating high/low) has ended. Demand has remained high for 3 consecutive periods (P37:69, P38:55, P39:62), averaging 62 units. We suffered a stockout in P39 due to this sustained high demand. With on-hand at 0 and relatively low incoming arrivals for P40 (43) and P41 (25), the total pipeline (223) is insufficient for the new demand rate (requiring ~310). I am switching mu_hat to recent_N=3 to aggressively target the new high mean (~62), and keeping sigma_hat at N=5 to retain some safety buffer from earlier variance.

Carry-over insight: Regime shift confirmed P37-P39: Oscillating volatility broken. Demand sustained at high level (avg ~62) for 3 periods, abandoning the previous pattern of deep troughs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has broken the oscillating sawtooth pattern and stabilized at a higher level (avg ~63 over last 4 periods). Consecutive stockouts indicate current parameters are too conservative. I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=4) to target this specific high-demand plateau and ignore prior troughs. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Regime confirmed P37-P40: Demand has stabilized at a high level (avg ~63), ending the oscillating volatility pattern (sawtooth) observed in P30-P36. Stockouts occurring due to under-forecasting this sustained rise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 42. Demand in P41 (44 units) dropped significantly from the sustained high levels seen in P37-P40 (avg ~63), signaling a potential end to the surge regime. While stockouts persisted in P41 due to the zero starting inventory, the aggressive ordering in previous periods has created a very heavy pipeline (345 units in-transit). With a lead time of 4 periods, this pipeline averages ~86 units/period arriving, which exceeds the current demand forecast (~59 units/period). The system will likely order 0 to rebalance, which is appropriate given the potential demand moderation. We use recent_N=5 (P37-P41) for parameters to capture the high-demand volatility while incorporating the recent drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P37-P40 avg ~63) appears to be cooling; P41 dropped to 44. Heavy pipeline (345 units) poses overstock risk if demand reverts to historical lower means.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has cooled from the P37-P40 surge (avg ~63) to a lower level in P41-P42 (avg ~47), closer to the P25-P29 baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With a heavy pipeline (295 units) covering ~6 periods of demand, we anticipate low order quantities. We use N=6 for forecast parameters to blend the recent drop with the lingering high demand signal to prevent under-ordering if demand rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge cooling confirmed: P41-P42 avg (47) is significantly lower than P37-P40 surge avg (63), returning to P25-P29 stability levels (~52).

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation period is 44. Reading 'Period 43 conclude', we see demand dropped sharply to 26 units, continuing the cooling trend (P41:44, P42:50). The high demand surge (P37-P40 avg ~63) is effectively over; the short-term average (P41-P43) is now 40 units. With a total stock pipeline of 280 units (79 on-hand + 201 in-transit), the inventory position is strong, covering almost 7 periods of current demand levels. There is a risk of overstocking if ordering continues based on the older high-demand data. Therefore, we use a tight recent_N=3 for mu_hat to rapidly adjust the forecast downwards. We keep sigma_hat at N=10 to account for the residual volatility of the recent regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling intensifies: P43 demand (26) dropped well below the stable baseline (~52), pulling the 3-period avg to 40. This confirms the end of the P37-P40 surge and signals a possible return to volatile low-demand patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 demand (42) confirms the cooling trend established in Periods 41-43. The high-demand surge (avg ~63) is definitively over. The new regime (P41-P44) averages ~40.5 units, which is a return to low-demand volatility similar to the P23-P25 era. With a total pipeline of 238 units (On-hand 121 + In-transit 117), we have approximately 6 periods of coverage at current demand levels (L+1=5 required). This high inventory position relative to the dropping demand necessitates a conservative forecast to prevent overstocking. We use recent_N=4 for demand and volatility to strictly align with the post-surge cooling data.

Carry-over insight: Cooling regime stabilized P41-P44: Average demand ~40.5 units, significantly below the P37-P40 surge (~63) and below the P25-P29 stable baseline (~52).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 context: Demand has stabilized in a lower regime. The last two periods (P44, P45) both had exactly 42 units of demand, and the 5-period average (P41-P45) is ~41 units. This confirms the 'cooling' trend has settled into a baseline similar to the historical low of P21-P24 (~40 units). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P42-P45). With current inventory at 185 and pipeline at 196, we are well-positioned but slightly under the theoretic base stock for this lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this specific low-demand stable regime (40-42 units) and its distinct variance profile.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed: P44-P45 demand stabilized at 42 units. P41-P45 average is ~41, consistent with the historical low regime (P21-P24 ~40) and well below the P37-P40 surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: Demand has firmly settled into a stable, low-volume regime. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is ~37 units, which is consistent with the historic low regime observed in P21-P24 and confirms the end of the P37-P40 surge. Volatility has also decreased significantly compared to the earlier oscillating phase, with a standard deviation of ~8.8 over the last 5 periods. Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P41 order arrived in P45). Given the stable low mean and reduced variance, I am using 'recent_N=5' for both mu and sigma to tightly calibrate the base stock to current conditions (~40 units/period) and avoid overstocking, as the current position (183 units) is nearly sufficient to cover the requested lead time.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime stabilization confirmed: P43-P46 demand average is ~37 units, sustaining the drop from the P37-P40 surge. Volatility has compressed, with recent demand tightly clustered (38-42 units in 3 of last 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48/50. Orders placed now (P48) with lead time 4 will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game horizon (P50), so current parameters do not impact service levels for the remainder of the game. However, analyzing the state: P47 demand spiked to 60, breaking the 'stabilization' around ~40 seen in P44-P46. This sudden rise puts the system at risk of stockouts in P49 and P50, as zero orders were placed in P44 and P45 based on the misleading low-demand signals (26-42). Current on-hand is 98 with only 25 units arriving in P50. We maintain reactive parameters (recent_N=3) to theoretically track the new shift, acknowledging that physical mitigation is no longer possible.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand spike in P47 (60 units) disrupts the low-demand cooling trend (P43-P46 avg ~37), signaling a return to volatility and likely causing stockouts in final periods due to prior conservative ordering.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. Demand has aggressively rebounded (P47: 60, P48: 64), confirming the end of the short cooling phase (P43-P46 avg ~39) and a return to the high-demand regime of P37-P40. With ending inventory at 34 and expected arrival of 0 in P49, stockouts are inevitable. New orders placed now (L=4) would arrive in Period 53, outside the simulation horizon, so they have no impact on service levels. Parameters are updated to reflect the true high demand state for statistical continuity.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P47-P48 average is 62 units, matching the P37-P40 high regime and breaking the P43-P46 cooling trend (~39). Stockouts imminent for P49-P50.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 / 50. Current status: On-hand 0, Pipeline 233. P49 saw a return to lower demand (41 units) after a short spike in P47-P48 (avg 62), though stockouts persisted due to low opening inventory. The pipeline is now filling significantly with previous heavy orders (110 units ordered P49). Since P49 demand (41) aligns with the P41-P46 cooling regime (avg ~40), the recent spike appears transient or volatile rather than a sustained shift. I will use a short rolling window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent fluctuation (~51 unit avg) without overreacting to the peak or the trough. Pipeline coverage is improving, so standard restorative parameters are sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P47-P48 (avg 62) snapped back: P49 demand dropped to 41, returning to prior cooling levels (~40). Volatility remains the dominant characteristic.
