Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No prior history exists for this SKU in the current run, though historical demand samples are provided in the prompt instructions. The historical samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) suggest an average demand around 182. Given this is the first period, we have no observed lead time data, so we must rely on the default promised lead time (0 periods). We will use the provided historical samples to initialize our demand estimates. We select 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to use the full extent of the provided pre-game history. Lead time L is set to default (promised 0) as there are no arrivals yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 2. The historical data shows Period 1 demand was 217. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the lead time is indeed 0 periods (order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1). This confirms the promised lead time of 0. Since we have a short history (only 1 datapoint: 217), I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the system use the aggregate mean so far. For L, I will proceed with 'default' since the observed lead time matches the promised 0. The system will use the L=0 formula: Base Stock covers Period 2 demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 context. Proven lead time is 0 (immediate arrival). Demand in P1 (217) and P2 (213) has been high and stable, closely tracking the provided historical samples (P1:217, P2:207) but realizing slightly higher. While the samples suggest a potential seasonal drop in P3 (sample: 170), the high cost of understocking (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, Critical Ratio 0.8) dictates a conservative approach that prioritizes service level over inventory minimization. A premature reduction in order quantity could lead to significant lost sales if the demand dip does not materialize. We rely on 'recent_N' (N=2) for mu_hat to anchor on the high observed demand. However, since the standard deviation of just 2 data points is misleadingly low, we override sigma_hat with an 'explicit' value (35.0) derived from the volatility of the provided historical samples to ensure a robust safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 4. Observed demand tracks the provided historical samples closely (P1: Obs 217 vs Hist 217; P2: Obs 213 vs Hist 207; P3: Obs 163 vs Hist 170). There is a clear downward trend/seasonality. Based on this correlation, we use the provided P4 historical sample (131) as the explicit demand forecast for this period. Observed lead time consistently 0 periods. Inventory covers partial demand, reorder required.

Carry-over insight: Demand pattern confirmed to closely track provided historical samples (P1-P3 accuracy high), suggesting strong seasonality/predictability. Period 4 forecast adjusted to 131 based on this profile.

Daily Profit: $628.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 starts with 0 inventory due to a stockout in Period 4. Period 4 demand (181) significantly exceeded its historical sample (131), breaking the high accuracy trend seen in Periods 1-3. Despite this deviation, the historical samples remain the best forward-looking baseline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the Period 5 sample (185). To account for the increased volatility and the prediction error in P4, I will use the standard deviation of the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) for sigma_hat, ensuring the safety stock buffer reflects recent instability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand vs Sample deviation in Period 4: Actual 181 vs Sample 131 (+50 units discrepancy). Previous correlation broken; monitoring if demand systematically exceeds samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $678.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 actual demand (177) tracked closely with its sample (185), suggesting the large deviation in Period 4 (181 vs 131) was likely an anomaly or one-off event rather than a permanent breakage in predictability. However, confirmed historical samples are only provided up to Period 5. For Period 6, we face a 'blind' horizon without a provided sample anchor. Historically, demand has shifted from a high regime (P1-P2 > 200) to a moderate regime (P3-P5 averaging ~174). To address this, we switch to a responsive moving average (recent_N=3) for the demand forecast to align with the recent moderate levels, while maintaining a wider window (recent_N=5) for volatility (sigma) to account for the fluctuations observed across the full game history. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Level has settled into a lower tier (avg ~174 over last 3 periods) compared to initial periods (avg ~215). Period 5 realignment with sample resolves Period 4's deviation anomaly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $771.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 observations: Current on-hand is critical (1 unit). Actual lead time confirmed as 0 (orders consistently arrive same-period). Demand in Period 6 (193) was higher than P4 (181) and P5 (177), raising the 3-period rolling average to ~184. The initial high-demand regime (P1-P2 >210) and the P3 dip (163) appear to be outliers surrounding a stabilized level in the high 180s. I will use a responsive N=3 for Mu to capture this local level (184) and N=5 for Sigma to buffer against the wider volatility observed over the last cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand level update: Recent 3-period average (P4-P6) has risen to ~184 (up from ~174 in previous window), indicating a gradual recovery or stabilization above the dip in Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $800.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: Lead time remains reliable at 0 periods (instant arrival). Demand in Period 7 (202) confirmed the recovery trend detected in P6 (193), pushing levels back toward early game highs (avg ~197 over last 2 periods vs initial P1-P2 avg of 215). The dip in P3-P5 seems to have been a transient seasonality bottom. With on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 0, the system requires a full replenishment. Given the clear recovery trend, I will use a short-term average (recent_3) to capture the current level (~191) which is higher than the overall average (~192 including early highs) but much higher than the dip. Wait, actually the overall average is pulled down by P3/P4. Let's look at recent_3 (P5=177, P6=193, P7=202) -> avg ~190.6. This is a safe base. I will use recent_3 for both mu and sigma to stay responsive to this upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P6 (193) and P7 (202) signal a return to ~200 levels following the mid-period dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: On-hand inventory is 20 units. Demand in P8 (182) dipped slightly from P7 (202) but remains higher than the mid-period lows (P3-P5). The recent 3-period average (P6-P8) is ~192, while the 5-period average is ~187. Given the cost of lost sales ($4) is 4x the holding cost ($1), under-forecasting is expensive. Therefore, I will use a shorter horizon (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent demand levels (~192) rather than letting the older dip drag the forecast down. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: P8 (182) indicates a plateau around ~190 (recent 3-period avg 192), halting the sharp upward trend observed in P6-P7, but maintaining levels well above the P3-P5 dip.

Daily Profit: $632.00, Daily Holding Cost: $43.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 begins with 43 units on hand. The previous period (P9) saw a sharp demand drop to 158, deviating significantly from the P6-P8 upward trend (avgs ~190s) and mimicking the dip seen in P3. Given this volatility and the lack of a stable stable single regime, we switch to a 5-period moving window for both mean and variance. This N=5 window (avg ~182) effectively smoothens the recent peak (P7: 202) with the recent dip (P9: 158). Lead time remains reliably 0. The critical ratio of 0.8 implies high service level targets, so a robust variance estimate (captured by recent_5) is essential to buffer against further fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand realignment: Significant drop to 158 (lowest since P4) halts the growth trend of P6-P8. 3-period average declines from ~192 to ~181, suggesting potential cyclical volatility rather than sustained growth.

Daily Profit: $752.00, Daily Holding Cost: $9.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $743.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 demand rebound to 188 confirms that the dip in Period 9 (158) was likely random noise/volatility rather than a trend change. The SKU continues to exhibit high volatility (ranging 158-202) but centers around a mean of ~185 in the last 5 periods. With on-hand inventory critically low at 9 units and observed lead time reliably 0, we must order aggressively to cover the full expected demand variance. I am setting mu_hat using N=5 to align with the current mean level (approx 185), excluding the outlier highs of periods 1-2. I am setting sigma_hat using N=10 (full available observed history) to ensure the safety stock buffer accounts for the wider dispersion seen across the entire game, protecting against potential spikes back to >210.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 10 rebound (188) following Period 9 dip (158) reinforces a volatile regime centering ~185 (5-period avg), distinct from early-game highs (>210).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 demand (186) mirrors Period 10 (188), suggesting the volatility observed in Periods 7-9 (range 158-202) is settling into a stable mean around 185-187. Lead times remain reliably 0. With current on-hand inventory critically low at 15 units, we select N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full recent cycle (including the P7 peak and P9 dip), resulting in a smoothed average (~183) that protects against stockouts (CR=0.8) without over-reacting to the recent short-term stability.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed: Period 11 (186) and Period 10 (188) suggest demand has settled near ~187, dampening the volatility observed in P7-P9.

=== Period 12 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $593.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision phase. Period 12 demand dropped to 158, repeating the dip seen in Period 9 and invalidating the hypothesis of stabilization around 187. The demand pattern now appears to oscillate between a floor of ~158 and a ceiling of ~188. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address this volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5), yielding a mean of roughly 174. This captures both the highs and lows of the current regime. On-hand inventory is 39, providing a small buffer against immediate demand.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal oscillation emerging: The drop in Period 12 (158) replicates Period 9, contradicting previous stabilization signs and suggesting demand fluctuates between ~160 and ~188.

Daily Reward (R_t): $692.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 demand (176) landed between the previous extremes of 158 and 188, suggesting that while volatility persists, the distribution is centering rather than strictly bimodal. Current on-hand is low (12). Lead time is consistently 0 (immediate). To handle the ongoing fluctuations (range 158-188), I am setting parameters to 'recent_N' with N=5. This window captures the full recent oscillation cycle (avg ~173, std dev ~15), ensuring the base stock covers the upper end of the volatility (~188) while avoiding overstocking if demand dips again.

Carry-over insight: Stability within volatility: While individual period demand fluctuates significantly (158-188), the 5-period moving average has stabilized remarkably near ~173 since Period 9, indicating a stationary but noisy regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 demand (162) remains within the identified 158-188 volatile range. The 5-period moving average (P10-P14) is 174, effectively unchanged from the previous period's average of 173, confirming a stationary regime. Given the high critical ratio (0.8), I use N=5 for demand parameters to include the higher demand realizations (188, 186) in the sample, ensuring sufficient safety stock against the recurring volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $629.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time consistently 0. Demand has converged to a lower, stable tier in recent periods (P14-15 both ~162), diverging from earlier volatility. Using recent_N=5 for mu/sigma (avg ~169) balances this recent stability with protection against the periodic spikes to ~180 seen in P11/P13.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed: Consecutive demands of 162 (P14) and 163 (P15) suggest the previous bimodal oscillation (158 vs 188) has collapsed into a stable mean near ~165.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand dropped significantly to 125, the lowest recorded value. This mirrors the Period 4 historical sample (131) which was not realized in the actual Period 4 demand (181), suggesting a potential 12-period seasonal pattern (P15=163 matched P3=163; P16=125 matches P4 sample=131). If this pattern holds, Period 17 may rebound towards Period 5 levels (~185). Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit/holding ratio), we apply a longer window (N=10) for parameters. This maintains a higher mean forecast (~170) and higher volatility buffer to protect against a potential rebound, rather than reacting solely to the P16 drop.

Carry-over insight: Possible 12-period seasonality emerging: Period 15 (163) matched Period 3 (163), and Period 16 (125) aligns with Period 4 sample (131), suggesting the sample seasonality is actualizing with a delay or cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $431.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: On-hand inventory is 65. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm L=0. Demand analysis: The pattern of closely tracking historical samples or a 12-period cycle appears to have broken. While P16 (125) aligned with Sample P4 (131), P17 (124) diverged sharply from Sample P5 (185), disproving a simple 12-period sample recurrence. Instead, P16 and P17 indicate a sustained downward step change in demand to a new regime around ~125 units (down from the prior ~180 average). To forecast for Period 18, I am using a short N=3 moving average for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the new low levels in P16/P17 while retaining P15 (163) as a safety buffer against a potential rebound or noise, preventing stockouts if demand fluctuates upward.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed: P16 (125) and P17 (124) establish a new level significantly below the prior ~180 average. Hypothesized seasonal link to historical samples failed (P17 Actual 124 vs Sample 185).

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 demand (145) indicates a partial recovery from the sharp dip in Periods 16-17 (~125), though levels remain below the Period 14-15 baseline (~163). Current on-hand inventory is critically low (12 units) because the previous order policy tightened into the dip. Given the 4x penalty for lost sales vs holding, we employ a 5-period distinct window (including the higher P14-P15 data) to set a target around ~144 units. This hedges against a full recovery to >160 while accommodating the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Partial recovery in Period 18: Demand rose to 145 from the P16-P17 low (~125), preventing a settled low regime. Current 5-period average is ~144, bridging the high (~163) and low (~125) phases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 demand (172) confirms a strong recovery from the P16-P17 dip (~125), resulting in a stockout due to conservative inventory. The return to ~172 aligns with the P13-P15 pre-dip average (~167) and the P10-P12 cluster (~177). Using a simple average of recent periods (which includes the ~125 outlier dip) would dangerously underestimate demand (avg ~146 vs recent 172). Therefore, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat set to 175, targeting the recovered 'normal' regime (170-180 range). I retain 'recent_N' (N=10) for sigma to capture the volatility of both the dip and the recovery. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Recovery validated: Period 19 demand (172) confirms a return to the ~160-180 range, suggesting the P16-P17 dip (~125) was a temporary fluctuation. P19 stockout emphasizes need to weight decision towards the recovery value rather than the recent average.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand recovery is confirmed with Period 19 (172) and Period 20 (182) returning to the high-volume regime (~175-190). The sequence P16-P20 (125, 124, 145, 172, 182) closely mirrors the provided samples (sample_4=131, sample_5=185) suggesting a seasonal alignment. If this pattern holds, Period 21 may align with Sample_1 (217), indicating a potential spike. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 ratio), I am raising the forecast (mu_hat) to 190 to hedge against this potential cyclical peak, while using a 10-period sigma to account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recovery sustained: Period 20 (182) and Period 19 (172) confirm a return to the ~180 volume level, marking the end of the P16-P17 dip. Current demand trajectory aligns with historical Sample 5 (185), possibly presaging a return to Sample 1 levels (~217) in the next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand (162) invalidated the hypothesis of a return to historical Sample 1 levels (217), indicating the provided samples are not currently predictive. Instead, demand has stabilized in the 160-180 band following the P16-P17 dip. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (Average ~172) to reflect this recent stabilization while excluding the prior dip. However, given the broader volatility observed over recent history (ranging 124-182), I am using a longer window (N=10) for sigma_hat to ensure safety stock is sufficient to handle potential fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sample correlation broken: Period 21 (162) failed to match Sample 1 (217), confirming historical sample data is not a current predictor. Demand has stabilized in a 160-180 regime (recent 3-period avg 172), distinct from early game highs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand plummeted to 112, a new historical low, shattering the stabilization seen in Periods 19-21. This creates extreme short-term volatility (range 112-182 in just 3 periods). Given the high cost of lost sales relative to holding ($4 vs $1), we cannot index solely on the lowest point (112) in case of a rebound. We use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu and sigma to capture this wide variance (Mean ~155, StdDev ~27) and ensure safety stock covers a potential return to ~180 levels. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: New historical low demand (112) shattered the previous stability assumption (160-180). Volatility has spiked, widening the effective range to [112, 182], and pulling the 5-period average down to ~155.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 demand (130) slightly improved over Period 22 (112) but confirmed a low-demand cluster similar to the Period 16-17 dip. This recurrent pattern suggests demand oscillates between high (~180) and low (~120) regimes. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit 4 vs Holding 1) and the historical tendency for rapid recovery (e.g., Period 19 jumped to 172 after a dip), reacting too strongly to the recent lows carries high service risk. Therefore, we use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window includes the high demand of Periods 19-20 (172, 182), preventing the forecast from collapsing to the dip level (~120) and ensuring sufficient inventory if the expected recovery occurs in Period 24. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Recurrent dip cycle identified: P22 (112) and P23 (130) mirror the short-lived low demand phase of P16-P17 (~125), reinforcing a volatile, oscillating regime rather than a permanent downward shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 demand (108) marks a new historic low, extending the current slump to 3 periods (P22-P24 avg ~117). This dip is deeper and longer than the P16-P17 oscillation. However, noticing the sharp recovery pattern seen in P18-P20, simply tracking the lowest recent values (N=3) risks stockouts if demand rebounds. I will use N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the recent high volatility (ranging from 182 to 108) and balance the forecast (~139) between the crash and the preceding high regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Severe demand contraction confirmed: Period 24 (108) sets a new all-time low. The current low regime (P22-P24 average ~117) is significantly deeper and more sustained than the oscillation observed in P16-P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $659.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 demand (165) confirms a sharp recovery from the low-demand trough of Periods 22-24 (avg 117). This jump mirrors the provided Sample 4 to Sample 5 transition (131 -> 185) and the previous cycle's recovery in Period 19. We are likely entering the high-volume phase of the oscillation (historically ~160-185). A rolling average would lag significantly due to the recent dip, so I am using an explicit forecast of 173 to target this high regime immediately.

Carry-over insight: Recovery confirmed: Period 25 (165) ended the low regime (P22-P24 avg 117). Demand profile mimics the Sample 4-to-5 jump, suggesting a transition to a higher volume phase (160-185).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (112) dropped back to the low range, invalidating the 'recovery' hypothesis from Period 25. The current regime (since Period 22) is characterized by a lower average (~125) with significant volatility (fluctuating between 108 and 165). I am applying 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering P22-P26) to reflect this specific low-and-volatile period. Given the high cost of stockouts vs holding (4:1 profit/holding ratio), the resulting safety stock from the high recent variance will help buffer against potential spikes back to 165, while the mean aligns with the new normal.

Carry-over insight: Regime Correction: P26 (112) proves P25 was a variance spike, not a recovery. Since P22, demand is in a volatile low regime (avg ~125, range 108-165) with no sustained growth trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand dropped to a new historical low of 79, significantly below the previous floor of 108 set in Period 24. This confirms a deepening 'volatile low' regime rather than a stable recovery. Although Period 25 showed a spike to 165, the subsequent periods (112, 79) indicate that 165 was likely an outlier or transient peak. The most recent 5-period average is approximately 119 with high variance. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) relative to holding ($1), a method that captures this high volatility is preferred to ensure safety stock covers potential fluctuations. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and variance to reflect the current unstable low-volume environment (~119 mean) while maintaining a safety buffer driven by the significant recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: New historical low confirmed: Period 27 demand (79) broke the previous floor (108), dragging the recent 5-period average down to ~119. The recovery in Period 25 appears to be an outlier in a sustained downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (90 units) confirms the deep contraction observed in Period 27 (79 units), pulling the 3-period moving average to ~94 units, the lowest on record. While the demand level has crashed, the recent history includes a significant volatility spike in Period 25 (165 units). To balance the low mean with the risk of a rebound, we use a short N=3 for the mean forecast (responsive to the crash) but a longer N=5 for the volatility estimate (retaining the memory of the P25 spike). With low holding costs ($1) vs high margins ($4), this parameterization defends against stockouts (~target 120) while acknowledging the sub-100 trend.

Carry-over insight: Sub-100 demand regime consolidating: Period 28 (90) reinforces Period 27 (79), pulling 3-period average to ~94. Volatility remains a risk as P25 (165) suggests sporadic recovery potential despite the downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 demand (89) confirms the sub-100 downward trend seen in Periods 27 (79) and 28 (90). The recent 3-period average is now ~86, a significant drop from the historical highs (>200). Although Period 25 had a spike to 165, the subsequent periods have consistently stayed low, suggesting that was an outlier or a brief recovery before a new low regime. With lead time stable at 0 periods, I will adopt a reactive short-term forecast (recent_N=3) to capture this low-volume regime (~86 units) without overstocking based on outdated high averages. The risk of stockout is low given the holding cost penalty outweighs the potential profit from a rare spike in this specific low-trend context, but I will maintain standard volatility coverage.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed: Periods 27-29 show consistent sub-100 demand (avg ~86), solidifying the crash from previous levels. Volatility remains but the baseline has shifted drastically downwards.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand spiked to 149, significantly exceeding the previous 3-period average of ~86 and causing a stockout (stock 92 vs demand 149). This contradicts the consolidation of a 'sub-100' regime observed in periods 27-29 and mimics the volatility seen in Period 25 (spike to 165). The current behavior is characterized by high volatility rather than a stable low baseline. To avoid understocking during these recurrent spikes while acknowledging the lower overall mean compared to early history, we expand the observation window to N=9 (covering the regime start at P22) to capture the full range of recent oscillations (79-165). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatility Re-emergence: Period 30 demand (149) shattered the consolidating sub-100 regime (P27-P29 avg ~86), mirroring the isolation spike pattern of P25. Demand is not stabilizing low but oscillating violently between ~80 and ~165 (avg ~115 since P22).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 demand (108) reverted to the recent baseline (similar to P24/P26) after the P30 spike (149). The current regime (Periods 22-31) is characterized by high volatility primarily centered around ~114, with a range of [79, 165]. The deep trough of Periods 27-29 appears to be the floor of this volatility rather than a permanent trend. Given the high cost of stockouts (4:1 ratio) and the presence of spikes (P25, P30), we switch to a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for both mean and volatility. This helps the backend set a safety stock that buffers against the upper range of this volatile band, averaging out the extreme lows.

Carry-over insight: Volatile Low Regime consolidating: periods 22-31 show a persistent noisy pattern (avg ~114) with intermittent spikes (~165) and deep troughs (~80), distinct from the earlier stable high regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 demand (89) aligns with the established 'low baseline' of roughly 90 units seen in Periods 27-29. This regime (active since Period 22) is characterized by a low average (~112) with high volatility, oscillating between deep troughs (~80-90) and sudden spikes (>145). Given the 4x profit margin relative to holding costs, it is critical to defend against the spikes despite the low median demand. I am selecting N=11 for the Moving Average to capture the full history of this volatile regime starting from the breakdown in Period 22, ensuring the variance calculation includes the full range of recent fluctuations (79 to 165).

Carry-over insight: Volatile Low Regime Baseline confirmed: Period 32 (89) reinforces a recurring floor of ~90 units. The regime alternates between this baseline and intermittent spikes (~150-165) roughly every 5 periods (P25, P30), keeping the long-term average suppressed at ~112.

Daily Reward (R_t): $470.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 34. On-hand inventory is critically low (14 units) with no incoming transit. The demand regime since Period 22 is confirmed as a 'volatile low' phase, distinct from the early high-demand era. Over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), demand has averaged approx 113 units but fluctuates wildly between a floor of ~80 (e.g., P27, P32) and spikes up to 165 (e.g., P25, P30). Period 33 demand (121) reflects this ongoing oscillation, rising above the P32 floor. To avoid stockouts during the recurrent spikes (which are costly given the 4:1 profit-to-holding ratio), we select N=12 for both mean and variance. This window captures the full breadth of the current regime's volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the upper-tail risks (up to ~165) while centering on the regime average.

Carry-over insight: Volatile Low Regime persistence: P22-P33 average ~113, range [79, 165]. Recurring pattern of sticking to a ~90 floor for 2-3 periods followed by spikes to 120-160 (e.g., P33). Volatility is intrinsic to this phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 demand (83) confirmed the lower boundary of the current regime. Since the major drop in Period 27, the demand processes have averaged approximately 101 units over the last 9 periods (P27-P35). A potential local cycle (Modulo 5) suggests stability for Period 36: previous 'Index Mod 5 = 1' periods in this regime were P26 (112) and P31 (108), predicting ~110 for P36. We select recent_N=9 to capture the full 'low regime' history, including the P30 spike (149), ensuring the safety stock (sigma) accounts for sporadic volatility despite the lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Local Seasonality in Low Regime: Periods with 'Index Mod 5 = 1' (P26, P31) consistently show demand ~110, while 'Mod 5 = 2' (P27, P32) consistently dip to ~80-90. P36 (Mod 1) is expected to align with the ~110 level.

=== Period 36 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $452.00, Daily Holding Cost: $7.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $445.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 demand (113) strongly validated the Mod-5 cycle hypothesis, landing squarely in the predicted ~110 range (matching P26/P31). Period 37 corresponds to 'Mod 5 = 2', which historically marks a local dip (P27=79, P32=89). While a demand of ~85-90 is expected based on this pattern, the 'Volatile Low' regime remains noisy (Standard Deviation ~20). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), I will use a robust 10-period window (Avg ~102) rather than explicitly forecasting the dip. This provides a safety buffer if the cycle breaks or demand spikes unexpectedly, preventing stockouts similar to Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Seasonality Specificity: The cyclical pattern is highly predictive for indices 1 (approx 110) and 2 (approx 85, local dip). However, indices 0 and 3 show higher variance (e.g., P30 vs P35). P37 is index 2, suggesting a dip to ~85.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 corresponds to Index 3 in the detected Mod-5 seasonality cycle, which typically manifests as a local demand peak (P23=130, P33=121), contrasting with the lower demand of indices 2 and 4. While P28 (Index 3) was lower (90), it occurred during a broader demand crash. Current recent averages (~103) understate this cyclic peak potential. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), avoiding stockouts is critical. I am setting an explicit forecast of 126 (aligning with P23/P33 levels) and a robust sigma of 25 to ensure adequate service level for the expected up-swing.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Seasonality Update: Index 3 identified as a recurring local peak (P23=130, P33=121) relative to neighbors, typically demanding ~120-130 units, barring broad market crashes (P28). This contrasts with Index 2 (dip, ~90) and Index 1 (stable ~110). Expecting Period 38 to follow this peak pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand (69) severely contradicted the Mod-5 seasonality hypothesis (which predicted a peak ~120-130 for Index 3), effectively setting a new all-time low instead. This confirms the regime is 'Volatile Low' with expanding variance downward, rather than strictly cyclical. Given the high cost of stockouts relative to holding (4:1 profit/holding ratio) and the history of sudden spikes (e.g., P30=149) amidst lows, I am expanding the averaging window to N=10. This captures the broader range of the current regime (69-149) to prevent understocking if demand mean-reverts or spikes, rather than over-indexing on the single depression of Period 38. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Seasonality Broken: Period 38 (Index 3) crashed to 69 instead of peaking (prev peaks 130, 121), invalidating the specific predictive cycle. New all-time low of 69 confirms 'Volatile Low' regime continues with high variance (range 69-165 in last 15 periods) but no consistent upward recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 corresponds to Index 0 in the modulo-5 cycle. Historically, Index 0 periods in the current 'Low Volatile' regime (post-Period 22) have been local peaks (P25=165, P30=149), with Period 35 (83) being the sole exception. Given the 1-period lead time (0 promised + instant arrival), we must cover Period 40 demand immediately. The recovery in Period 39 (111) from the P38 dip (69) suggests demand is resilient around the ~110 baseline rather than crashing. To account for the 'Index 0' upside potential, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 132 (average of the last three Index 0 demands: 165, 149, 83). This balances the high probability of a spike against the P35 failure. With a profit-to-holding cost ratio favoring service (4:1), aiming for the historical Index 0 average protects against stockouts during a likely peak.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Cycle Update: Period 39 (111) recovered from P38 dip, restoring the ~110 baseline. Period 40 (Index 0) historically represents a local maximum (avg ~157 in P25/30), though P35 (83) indicates downside risk exists.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (val=54) marked a severe crash for the 'Mod 5 = 0' index, which was historically a peak (165->149->83->54). However, the upcoming Period 41 corresponds to 'Mod 5 = 1', which has shown remarkable stability around ~110 units throughout the low volatile regime (P26=112, P31=108, P36=113). Despite the general downward trend in other indices, Mod 1 has not degraded. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 113 to match this resilient cyclical pattern. Sigma is set to recent_5 to capture the background volatility of surrounding periods.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Seasonality Divergence: Index 0 (P35, P40) has collapsed (83->54), while Index 1 (P36, P31, P26) remains resiliently stable ~110. This confirms disjoint behavior between cycle indices; general downward trend does not uniformly affect all cycle phases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 corresponds to Index 2 in the observed Mod-5 seasonality cycle. While the overall regime is volatile (witnessed by the crash in P40 to 54), Index 2 has shown a consistent localized recovery trend across recent cycles: P27(79) -> P32(89) -> P37(101). Period 41 (Index 1) confirmed the expected stability of that index ~110. Therefore, we project Period 42 demand to follow the Index 2 trend, estimating ~105 units. We use 'explicit' to target this specific value rather than averaging the noisy recent history (which includes the P40 crash). Sigma is set to recent_10 to capture the true volatility of the last two full cycles.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Cycle behaviors bifurcating: Index 1 (P41=110, P36=113) is a confirmed stable anchor. Index 0 (P40=54, P35=83) has collapsed into deep troughs. Index 2 (P37=101, P32=89) shows a steady upward recovery trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (101) matched Period 37 (101) exactly, confirming stability in Index 2 of the Mod-5 cycle. Period 43 corresponds to Index 3. While Index 3 crashed to 69 in P38, prior instances were 121 and 130. Recent stable periods (P39, P41, P42) average ~107. I am forecasting a recovery to ~115 to defend against stockouts if the P38 crash was an outlier, supported by the resilience seen in P39-P42.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Index 2 stability confirmed: Period 42 (101) matched Period 37 (101). The cycle suggests distinct risk profiles: Indices 1 & 2 are stable/recovering (~100-110), while Indices 0 & 3 define the deep volatility/crashes in the current low regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (Index 3, demand 63) confirmed the crash pattern identified in Period 38 (69), invalidating older data where Index 3 was a peak. We are now in Period 44 (Index 4). Historical data for Index 4 (P39=111, P34=98, P29=89) shows a consistent recovery trend following the Index 3 dips. P39 rebounded to 111 after P38's drop; we expect P44 to similarly rebound to ~100-110 range after P43's drop. Setting explicit forecast to 108 based on this specific cyclical recovery. Using recent_N=10 for sigma to capture the full volatility of the current regime (ranges 54-113).

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Seasonality Update: Index 3 (P38=69, P43=63) is now confirmed as a structural 'crash' point, joining Index 0 (P40=54) as high-risk. Conversely, Index 4 (P39=111, P34=98) reliably signals recovery/rebound following Index 3 dips. Current cycle profile: Index 1&2=Stable (~100-110), Index 4=Recovery (~100+), Index 0&3=Crash (<70).

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 is Index 0 in the Mod-5 cycle. Previous Index 0 periods (P35=83, P40=54) suggest a downward trend and high risk of low demand. Crucially, the expectation that Index 4 signals recovery failed in Period 44 (demand 61 vs expected >100), meaning the 'Crash' regime has expanded to adjacent indices (0, 3, and now 4). Only Indices 1 and 2 remain stable above 100. Given the high service cost (CR=0.8), we cannot purely forecast the minimum (54), but must account for the regime's average. Adopting N=5 captures the full cycle's new localized mean (~78) and volatility, balancing the risk of a continued crash against occasional stable periods.

Carry-over insight: Mod-5 Seasonality Collapse: Index 4 (P44=61) failed to recover, joining Indices 0 (P40=54) and 3 (P43=63) in a structural 'Crash' tier (~60 units). The regime is now strictly bifurcated: Indices 1 & 2 (~100-110) vs Indices 0, 3, & 4 (~50-65). Systemic demand average is deteriorating.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 corresponds to Index 1 of the 5-period cycle. While the broader regime has seen Indices 0, 3, and 4 collapse to a 'Crash Tier' (avg ~60, confirmed by P45's 60 units), Index 1 has remained remarkably stable and distinct (history: P26=112, P31=108, P36=113, P41=110). I am strictly respecting this bifurcation. I forecast demand of ~111 with tight variance (sigma=5) as Index 1 shows minimal volatility compared to the rest of the cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Mod-5 Bifurcation validated: Period 45 (Index 0) demand of 60 confirms the 'Crash Tier' (Indices 0, 3, 4 averaging ~60). Anticipating Period 46 (Index 1) to hold 'Stable Tier' (~110-113 range) despite systemic weakness.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 demand (61) marked a critical failure of the previously reliable Mod-5 Index 1 pattern (historical avg ~110), confirming that the demand collapse has spread to all cycle indices. We have now seen 4 consecutive periods of demand in the ~60-63 range (P43-P46), establishing a new 'Global Low' baseline. However, given the high stockout cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and the recent history of volatility (P42 was 101), strictly following the average of ~61 is risky if demand rebounds. I am selecting N=5 for parameters to include Period 42 (101) in the sample. This keeps the mean slightly elevated (~69) and the standard deviation wider, creating a safety buffer (~80-85 units) to protect against a potential mean reversion to the ~100 level while acknowledging the low trend.

Carry-over insight: Systemic Demand Collapse: The Mod-5 cycle reliability has broken. Index 1 (P46=61) failed to maintain its historical stability (~110), aligning with the crash levels of other indices. A specific 'Global Low' regime of ~61 units has consolidated over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), overriding previous cyclical patterns.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has settled into a 'Global Low' regime, completely flattening near ~62 units for the last 5 periods (P43-P47 range: 60-64). The previously observed Mod-5 seasonality has collapsed, with all indices now converging to this crash level. Period 48 corresponds to Index 3, which has historically been a weak point recently (P38: 69, P43: 63), reinforcing the expectation of low demand. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to tightly track this new low baseline. However, to hedge against a potential sudden recovery (as seen historically where demand jumps from ~60 to ~110), I am using recent_N=10 for sigma_hat. This includes higher variance samples from periods P39-P42, ensuring the safety stock calculation retains some buffer against volatility despite the current flatline.

Carry-over insight: Global Low regime solidified: Periods 43-47 show zero growth with a tight average of ~62 units, dissolving previous cyclical patterns.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. Demand has stabilized in a distinctive low regime (avg ~64 over last 6 periods), though Period 48 (75) showed a slight increase. Lead time remains 0. With only 2 periods left and very low inventory (6 units), the priority is serving the remaining low-volume demand without overstocking for a non-existent long-term future. Using recent_N=6 captures the structural shift to <80 demand that began in Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Global Low regime persists but shows slight upward variance: Period 48 (75) broke the tight ~60-64 range seen in P43-P47. New baseline appears to be ~65-70.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 marks the start of the final decision for this game horizon. Reviewing recent history (P43-P49), we have established a 'Global Low' regime where demand averages around ~60-75 units, significantly below earlier peaks. Specifically, the last 7 periods (P43-P49) have demands: 63, 61, 60, 61, 64, 75, 54. The average of these 7 periods is exactly 62.6. Period 48 showed a slight bump to 75, but P49 immediately corrected back down to 54, reinforcing the low-demand baseline. The historical Mod-5 cyclic patterns have completely collapsed into this low-variance stagnation. With on-hand inventory at 15 and 0 in-transit, we face immediate stockout risk if demand hits the average ~63. Given the Lead Time is 0 (immediate arrival), we need to order enough to cover Period 50. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the recent 7-period average (~63) plus a safety buffer to 70 to account for minor variance like Period 48, while keeping sigma low to reflect the tight range.

Carry-over insight: Global Low regime confirmed stable: Periods 43-49 show consistent demand averaging ~63 units (range 54-75), with previous cyclical volatility dissolved.
