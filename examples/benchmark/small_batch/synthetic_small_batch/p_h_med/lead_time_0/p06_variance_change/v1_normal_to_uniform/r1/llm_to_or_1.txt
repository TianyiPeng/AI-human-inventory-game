Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No history of orders or lead times yet. Promised lead time is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility in the provided samples (range 60-122). I will base the initial forecast on the average of all 5 available historical samples (Period_1 to Period_5) provided in the prompt description (approx avg 98.2). Since lead time is promised as 0, L=0 is used. I will use 'default' methods to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. Period 1 observed demand (118) aligned closely with the provided Period 1 historical sample (122), suggesting the historical data is a reliable forecast. We therefore explicitly set mu_hat to match the Period 2 historical sample (121). Observed lead time in Period 1 was 0 (instant arrival), so we retain the default lead time (0). Since observed game history (1 period) is insufficient for variance calculation, we set sigma_hat explicitly based on the standard deviation of the full provided historical dataset.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1). Demand follows historical samples closely (P1 actual 118 vs history 122).

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 historical data suggests a sharp seasonal demand drop to 60 units (down from ~120 in P1/P2). However, Period 2 actual demand (155) was 28% higher than historical samples, indicating a potential upward intensity shift. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we cannot fully trust the historical drop to 60 without risking significant stockouts if the P2 trend persists. We adopt a blended forecast: acknowledging the seasonal dip (drop from P2 levels) but buffering significantly above the historical mean to 90. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility detailed: Period 2 actual (155) exceeded history (121) by +28%, contradicting the stable Period 1 match. Historical seasonality predicts a sharp -50% drop in Period 3 (60 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 actual demand (128) was more than double the historical sample (60), leading to a second consecutive stockout. The historical samples (Series: 122, 121, 60, 83...) predict a low-volume slump that is not materializing in reality. Actual demand (118, 155, 128) is averaging ~134 units, significantly higher than the Period 4 historical sample of 83. To stop the stockout cycle and align with the high-volume reality, I am switching to recent_N (N=3) for demand parameters, ignoring the misleading historical samples. Lead time remains observed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Regime shift confirmed: Actual demand consistently exceeds historical samples (P2 +28%, P3 +113%). The historical 'dip' in P3 was observed but much shallower and higher volume than predicted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $435.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5. Actual lead time consistently 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Demand continues to significantly exceed historical samples (P4 actual 117 vs history 83, +41%), but the shape of the demand curve has decoupled from history. While history predicted a recovery in P4 (60->83), actual demand declined slightly (128->117). Given this trend inversion, reliance on historical seasonality estimates is risky. I am switching to 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu and sigma to capture the current high-volume regime (avg ~133) without over-fitting to the historical curve shape which is currently unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Trend decoupling observed P4: History predicted demand rise (60 -> 83), but actuals dropped (128 -> 117). High-volume regime persists (actuals avg ~133 vs history ~88).

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: Inventory at 52 units, lead time consistently 0 periods. Demand analysis: Observed a clear cooling trend from the Period 2 peak (155 -> 128 -> 117 -> 98). Period 5 actual (98) fell below the historical sample (105) for the first time since Period 1, suggesting the 'high-volume anomaly' observed in Periods 2-4 has ended or paused. Given the downward trend and the lack of a Period 6 historical sample, I am switching to a responsive 'recent_N' forecast (N=3) for the mean to capture the lower recent volume (avg ~114) rather than the earlier peaks. Volatility remains captured with N=5 to account for the range of fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend confirmed: Consistent decline from P2 peak (155) to P5 (98). P5 actual (98) dropped below historical sample (105), ending the 'Actual > History' regime seen in P2-P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand (98) matched Period 5 (98), confirming a stabilization of the recent downtrend. Demand is currently settling near 100 units, significantly below the P2 peak (155). Given the critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), we prioritize service level. We use a slightly longer window (N=4) for mu_hat to include some of the higher demand from P4/P3 (Avg ~110), rather than just the recent low plateau (Avg ~104), to prevent stockouts if demand rebounds. We use N=5 for sigma_hat to maintain a larger safety stock buffer based on earlier volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 5 and 6 held flat at 98 units, suggesting the end of the P2-P5 downtrend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 saw a drastic demand drop to 47 units, down 52% from the stable level of 98 observed in P5-P6. This drop echoes the volatility of the historical 'dip' (originally P3), though occurring later in the actual timeline. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), assuming the drop is permanent (N=1) is risky if demand rebounds like the historical pattern (P3 to P4). I apply recent_N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~81) to balance the recent localized crash with the prior stability, hedging against a potential recovery. Sigma also uses N=3 to capture the increased volatility spread. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand crash in Period 7: 47 units (-52% vs P5-P6 avg of 98). This drop mirrors the magnitude of the historical 'P3 dip', suggesting a delayed seasonal low point.

Daily Reward (R_t): $309.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 demand (83 units) recovered strongly from the Period 7 low (47) and perfectly matched the Period 4 historical sample (83). This suggests the demand curve has realigned with the historical data, identifying P7 as a delayed version of the historical P3 dip. Accordingly, Period 9 is forecast to match the historical Period 5 sample (105). We use explicit parameters to target this recovery trajectory (mu=105) and maintain a robust safety stock (sigma=30) given the recent volatility (26+ units std dev), prioritizing avoiding stockouts with a 0.8 critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand realignment detected: Period 8 actual (83) matched History P4 (83) exactly, suggesting the P7 crash (47) was a delayed seasonal dip corresponding to History P3 (60).

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 demand (123) indicates a strong recovery from the P7 dip, exceeding the P5-P6 baseline (98). The correlation with historical samples suggests we are back to a high-volume regime possibly exceeding historical averages (Historical P5 was 105 vs Actual P9 123). With on-hand inventory critically low at 8 units and service level paramount, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 115 to reflect this rebound, slightly conservative vs the most recent 123 but higher than the dip-affected average. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand rebound confirmed: P9 actual (123) exceeded P8 (83) and the P5-P6 baseline (98), suggesting a return to the high-volume regime seen in early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 demand (92 units) dropped from the Period 9 spike (123 units), settling near the P5-P6 average levels (~98). This suggests Period 9 might have been a seasonal peak (analogous to History P5) and we are returning to a moderate volume regime. Given the high volatility in recent periods (47, 83, 123, 92), I will use a short moving average (N=3) to maintain responsiveness to these rapid fluctuations while filtering out the older, distinct high-volume regime of P1-P4. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand volatility confirmed; actual (92) dropped from P9 peak (123), averaging ~99 units over the last 3 periods. The P9 spike likely corresponded to the historical P5 peak, suggesting we have passed a local seasonal maximum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 decision. Status: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Demand Analysis: Period 11 demand was 119, causing a stockout (sold 117). This represents a significant deviation from the previous period's drop (92) and suggests the volatility is continuing. The recent demand sequence is 83 -> 123 -> 92 -> 119. This zig-zag pattern indicates high variance. The average of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is approx 104.25 units. The historical samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) have an average of ~98. Given the recent stockout and the return to higher demand levels (~120 range appearing in 2 of the last 3 periods), we must defend against under-ordering. Strategy: Use 'calculate' for L (0). For mu_hat, use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the fluctuating recent mean of ~104. For sigma_hat, the volatility is high (range 83-123), so use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the standard deviation of this volatile block. This balances the risk of stockouts (costly) against holding inventory, targeting the 80% service level.

Carry-over insight: Zig-zag demand pattern confirmed: P8-P11 actuals (83 -> 123 -> 92 -> 119) show high period-to-period volatility without a clear directional trend, averaging ~104 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (Date: Period_13). Demand from P8 to P12 exhibits a consistent zig-zag oscillation (Low: ~84, High: ~120). Sequence: 83 (L) -> 123 (H) -> 92 (L) -> 119 (H) -> 84 (L). Following this pattern, Period 13 is expected to be a 'High' demand period (~120 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit with a high critical ratio (4:1), we select parameters to cover the 'High' demand scenarios. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 (samples: 123, 92, 119, 84) yields a mean of ~104.5 and sufficient volatility (sigma ~19.4) to generate a base stock (~121) that covers the expected peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Zig-zag demand pattern persists through P12: Alternating high/low volume (Highs ~120, Lows ~85). P12 (84) confirmed the 'Low' phase, implying P13 likely 'High'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 demand (102) slightly dampened the previous high-amplitude zig-zag pattern but maintained the oscillation around a mean of ~104 (last 5 periods). With current inventory critically low (19 units) and Lead Time consistently 0, the priority is responding to this stable but volatile average. I am selecting 'recent_N' (N=5) for both mu and sigma to capture the full range of recent volatility (from low 84 to high 123) and ensure sufficient base stock for the 0.8 critical fractile.

Carry-over insight: Zig-zag amplitude dampening: While oscillation persists, P13 (102) was closer to the mean (~104) than previous peaks (123, 119), suggesting volatility might be stabilizing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 demand (130) spiked significantly, causing a stockout and contradicting the previous hypothesis of dampening volatility. The recent pattern (P12: 84, P13: 102, P14: 130) suggests an escalating 'zig-zag' or high-variance regime rather than stabilization. With current on-hand inventory at 0 and a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), avoiding lost sales is critical. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this active erratic range (92-130) while excluding the severe localized dips from earlier periods (like P7's 47) that would underestimate current risk. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Zig-zag volatility resurgence: P14 demand (130) broke the dampening trend, reaching the highest level since P2. The oscillation range has widened (84-130) over the last 3 periods, confirming an active high-volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: Recovering from consecutive stockouts in P14 (lost 11 units) and P15 (lost 1 unit). Current on-hand is 0. Key observation: The 'Zig-zag' pattern (alternating high/low) identified in past insights appears to have broken or shifted, as P14 (130) and P15 (123) were both high-volume periods. The average demand over the last 3 periods (118.3) is significantly higher than the last 5 (111.6). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the strategy prioritizes availability. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current elevated demand level aggressively, while using a slightly longer window (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen since P11 (range 84-130). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Zig-zag pattern disrupted Period 15: Two consecutive high demand periods (P14: 130, P15: 123) broke the previously observed alternating high/low trend, signaling a potential shift to a sustained high-demand cluster.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted to a high-volume cluster (avg ~131 over last 3 periods), breaking the previous oscillation pattern. Stockouts occurred in P14, P15, and P16 due to underestimating this surge. Transitioning mu_hat to recent_N=3 to aggressively target this new high mean (~131) and using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the transition volatility. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand cluster confirmed: P14-P16 actuals (130, 123, 139) avg ~131, consistently high unlike the prior zig-zag pattern. This marks a sustained regime shift requiring higher base stock targets.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 actual demand (107 units) dropped significantly from the Period 14-16 high-demand cluster (avg ~131), disrupting the upward trend. Despite this dip, the 4-period average (125 units) remains well above the historical baseline. Given the Critical Ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), avoiding stockouts is the priority. We use N=4 to capture the recent high-volume volatility while acknowledging the Period 17 moderation. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand cluster disrupted: P17 demand (107) broke the P14-P16 high streak (avg 131), signaling a return to high-variance oscillation rather than a stable high plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 demand (78 units) confirmed significant cooling, dropping well below the P14-P16 high-demand cluster (avg ~131) and following the decline in P17 (107). This signals a regime shift back to lower volumes or high-variance oscillation similar to the zig-zag pattern seen in Periods 8-13. Given the high volatility and the risk of a sudden rebound (as seen after previous lows), I am using a 5-period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This averages recent highs with the current lows (~115 units), providing a buffer against stockouts (critical ratio 0.8) while acknowledging the downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime ended: Period 18 (78) confirms the downtrend started in P17, shattering the P14-P16 high cluster. Current levels resemble the P8/P12 lows, suggesting a return to high-amplitude oscillation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: The high-demand cluster observed in Periods 14-16 (avg ~131) has definitively ended. We are now in a confirmed low-demand regime. The last three periods show a steep decline: P17 (107) -> P18 (78) -> P19 (66). The average for the last 3 periods is ~84 units, significantly below the prior peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Given the downward momentum, using a short history window (N=3) allows the system to adapt quickly to the lower baseline (~66-84 range) and avoid overstocking. Current on-hand is 70, which covers most of the expected demand if the trend continues, so the order will be modest.

Carry-over insight: Demand downtrend confirmed: P17-P19 shows consecutive decline (107 -> 78 -> 66), establishing a new low-volume regime (avg ~84) after the P14-P16 high cluster.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has crashed significantly from the P14-P16 peak (avg 131) to a P20 low of 49. The last 3 periods (P18-P20) show a consistent low/declining regime (avg ~64), resembling the deep dip seen in P7. I am switching to recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma to tightly couple the forecast to this new low-volume reality and prevent overstocking as the seasonal peak fades. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed: P20 actual (49) matches P7 low (47), establishing a floor for the current downtrend. The high-volume regime of P14-P16 is definitively over.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 Review: We are at a potential turning point. After a steep decline from the P14-P16 high cluster (avg ~131) down to a trough in P20 (49), demand in P21 rebounded significantly to 75 (+53% vs P20). This breaks the sequential downtrend observed over P17-P20. With only 2 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the system is extremely vulnerable to stockouts if this rebound persists or accelerates. The current low stock position is a result of the system aggressively cutting orders during the demand crash. To recover service levels (target 80%) and avoid stocking out during a potential recovery, I must react quickly to this upward signal. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the trough (49) and the recovery (75) while smoothing out the extreme volatility. The average of the last 3 periods (66, 49, 75) is ~63, but given the critical ratio (0.8) and the depleted inventory, relying solely on this depressed average is risky. However, since the recovery is fresh, I will stick to the recent data but ensure the safety stock (via sigma) covers the volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected P21: Actual (75) rose +53% from P20 low (49), breaking the 4-period downtrend (P17-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 Context: Entering P23 with 0 inventory after a stockout in P22 (demand 121, on-hand 75). 

Analysis: Demand in P22 (121) surged +61% from P21 (75), confirming a V-shaped recovery and an end to the P18-P20 low-demand regime (avg ~64). The P22 value matches the high-volume levels seen in P14-P16 (avg 131) and earlier peaks. 

Strategy: Given the Critical Ratio (Profit $4 / ($4+$1) = 0.8), the cost of lost sales is 4x the holding cost. Recent history averages (P18-P22 avg ~78) are heavily dragged down by the now-ended dip and would cause significant stockouts if demand persists at the recovered level. I am treating P22 as a signal of a return to the 'High Regime'. I will use an explicit forecast of 125 (close to recent peak and prior high cluster average) to aggressively rebuild inventory and capture high-margin sales. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the high volatility (49 to 121) observed during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand V-shaped recovery confirmed: Period 22 (121) surged +61% from P21 (75), breaking the P17-P20 downtrend and returning to levels consistent with the P14-P16 high-volume regime (avg ~131). The low-demand phase (P18-P20) appears to have passed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 demand exploded to 182 units (a record high), confirming an aggressive V-shaped recovery. Including older low-demand periods (P20=49, P21=75) in the forecast would severely drag down the target inventory and cause stockouts in this new super-high volume regime. With critical ratio 0.8 favoring service, I am switching to a highly responsive N=2 moving average (focusing solely on the P22-P23 surge) to chase this upward trend and capture potential continued highs.

Carry-over insight: Super-High demand surge: Period 23 hit 182 units (historical max), accelerating the V-shaped recovery into a new regime far exceeding the P14-P16 highs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand peaked at 182 in P23 and settled to 122 in P24. This signals a return to the high-volume regime but suggests P23 was an outlier. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~142) to remain responsive to the high trend, protecting against another surge, while the Lead Time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P23 (182) appears to be an outlier peak, with P24 (122) returning to the ~120 baseline observed in P22. Volatility remains high due to this surge.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: We are entering Period 26 with 0 inventory following a stockout in Period 25. Actual demand in P25 was 179, contradicting the P24 belief that the P23 spike (182) was an outlier. We are now in a confirmed high-volatility regime (P22-P25) characterized by oscillating 'High' (~120) and 'Super-High' (~180) demand. The average over the last 4 periods is ~151 with high variance. Given the high cost of lost sales (stockout in P25) vs holding cost, and the volatility, I will use the recent 4-period window to capture this specific oscillating regime. This sets the target high enough to cover another potential spike while reflecting the average level. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-volume oscillation pattern established: P25 demand (179) confirms that the P23 spike (182) was not an outlier. The regime from P22-P25 oscillates between ~120 and ~180 units (avg ~150), representing the highest volume and volatility phase observed to date.

Daily Reward (R_t): $590.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. The current high-volume regime (P22-P26) continues, characterized by an average demand of ~152 units and high volatility (range 121-182). Period 26 demand (154) was robust, deviating from the previous 'dip' pattern (where demand alternated to ~120), suggesting the demand floor may be rising. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 (P22-P26) for both mean and volatility to fully capture this aggressive regime and prevent stockouts (which occurred in P22, P23, P25). Promised lead time (0) remains reliable.

Carry-over insight: Oscillation dampening / Floor rising: P26 (154) deviated from the prior Low-High-Low-High pattern (121-182-122-179) by not dropping to the ~120 floor, suggesting the demand floor is rising or volatility is stabilizing around the ~150 mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $693.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Demand has stabilized into a high-volume plateau. The last 3 periods (P25-P27) observed demands of 179, 154, and 174, averaging 169 units. This suggests the previous oscillation (dipping to ~120 every other period) has ended or the demand floor has risen significantly. On-hand inventory is critically low (3 units). Lead times remain reliably 0. I am selecting 'recent_N' = 5 for both mu and sigma to capture the high-regime characteristics (start of the surge in P23) while accounting for the variance seen in P24. This sets a base stock target robust enough to cover the sustained high volume.

Carry-over insight: High-demand plateau established: P25-P27 demand (179, 154, 174) averages 169 units, breaking the previous oscillation pattern where demand alternated between ~120 and ~180. The demand floor appears to have risen significantly, staying above 150 for 3 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 experienced a massive demand crash to 26 units (-85% from peak), definitively ending the high-volume plateau of Periods 25-27. This crash mirrors previous structural breaks observed in Period 7 (47 units) and Period 20 (49 units). Historical post-crash patterns (Period 8 and Period 21) suggest a partial rebound to the 75-85 unit range next period, rather than an immediate return to >150 levels. With 158 units on-hand, current inventory is sufficient to cover even a substantial unexpected surge (up to ~160 units). Therefore, we use explicit parameters to forecast the expected rebound (~80) and dampen safety stock, ensuring no new orders are placed to reduce holding costs while the excess inventory bleeds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand crash confirmed Period 28: Actual (26) dropped significantly from P27 (174), breaking the high-volume regime. This mirrors cyclical crashes in P7 and P20. Historical recovery patterns suggest a 2-period ramp-up (approx 80 then 120) rather than instant recovery to peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 represents the expected recovery phase following the P28-P29 crash. Current inventory is healthy (112). P29 demand (46) effectively matches the historical crash floors of P7 (47) and P20 (49). Previous post-crash recoveries (P8, P21) saw demand bounce to 83 and 75 respectively. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat yields an average of 82 (from 174, 26, 46), which aligns perfectly with the expected rebound target of ~80 units. The high sigma from N=3 covers the volatility risk if the recovery is faster than expected.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Crash trough confirmed: P29 demand (46) aligns with P7 (47) and P20 (49) lows. Historical patterns (P8=83, P21=75) strongly predict a rebound to the ~80 unit range in the next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $600.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (187 units) confirms a 'Super V-shaped' recovery, surging past the historical prediction of ~80 and immediately returning to the high-volume regime levels (compare P23-P27 avg ~169). The 2-period seasonal crash (P28-P29) appears to be fully concluded. Standard averaging methods (recent_N) are currently poisoned by the crash values (26, 46); therefore, I am using explicit estimates to aggressively target the 'Super-High' regime average (~180) and account for high volatility (sigma=40) to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Super V-shaped recovery confirmed: Period 30 demand (187) surged +306% from P29 (46), bypassing the historical intermediate recovery phase. Valid demand has immediately snapped back to the 'Super-High' regime (avg ~175), proving the P28-P29 crash was a transient 2-period seasonal interruption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 demand (134) confirms the recovery is sustained, though it moderated from the P30 spike (187). The demand environment has stabilized back into a high-volume regime (avg ~160 over last 2 periods) significantly above the historical mean. To avoid the low biases from the P28-P29 crash outliers (26, 46), I am using a tight review window (N=2) for both expected demand and volatility. This filters out the crash data and sets a base stock target reflective of the current high-demand reality (approx 160 mean + safety stock), ensuring sufficient coverage for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-volume regime confirmed: Post-crash demand (P30-P31) averages 160.5 units, establishing a new baseline significantly above the P28-P29 lows. Volatility remains high (134 vs 187), requiring responsive parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-118.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 demand crashed to 15, mirroring the extreme drop in P29 (26) and P7/P20. This confirms a highly volatile 'High-Crash' zig-zag pattern in the current regime (Super-High peaks ~180 followed by deep crashes ~15-26). Given the immediate V-shaped recoveries observed previously (P30 surged to 187 after P29 crash), we must anticipate a sharp rebound. The current on-hand of 178 is substantial, covering the average of the high regime (~160), but given the potential for spikes to ~187, we maintain a defensive posture. Lead time remains consistently 0. We use 'recent_N=5' for mu_hat to capture the blended high volatility (peaks and crashes) of recent periods (P28-P32), and 'recent_N=5' for sigma_hat to reflect the extreme variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified Period 32: Actual (15) crashed -88% from P31 (134), mirroring the P28-P29 crash pattern. This confirms a binary regime: 'Super-High' (~180) vs 'Deep Crash' (<30), requiring parameters that can absorb extreme shocks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand (86) recovered partially from the Period 32 crash (15), mirroring the recovery pattern seen after the P29 crash. Historical precedence (P30 rebound to 187) suggests a high probability of a strong snap-back to the high-volume regime (~160-180 units) in Period 34. Current inventory (92) is insufficient for this expected rebound. A simple average would be dragged down by the P32 outlier, so I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 170 to aggressively restock for the expected high demand. Sigma uses recent history to capture the extreme variance (15-187 range).

Carry-over insight: Cyclical Crash-Recovery confirmed: P32 crash (15) followed by P33 rise (86) mirrors the P29 (46) -> P30 (187) pattern. Expecting immediate return to high-volume regime in P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $387.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 is positioned to be the high-demand peak of the current volatility cycle. Following the crash in P32 (15) and recovery in P33-P34 (86 -> 123), historical precedents (P30, P23) suggest the next period will see a 'Super-High' spike around 180+ units. Setting explicit mu_hat to 185 to maximize service level for this expected spike.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical Crash-Recovery pattern confirmed: The sequence P32-P34 (15->86->123) mirrors the recovery phase of the P28-P30 cycle, predicting a major demand spike in P35 similar to P30 (187).

Daily Reward (R_t): $411.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 demand (130) confirms a solid recovery to the high-volume regime, closely matching the P14-P16 plateau. While the expected P35 spike did not materialize, historical data (P22->P23, P24->P25) indicates that periods in the 120-130 range often directly precede major surges to ~180 units. Given the high cost of stockouts ($4 profit vs $1 holding) and the 'calm before the storm' signal, we adopt an aggressive position to cover a potential Period 36 spike. Current on-hand (109) is insufficient for even the current baseline demand (130).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Stability confirmed at high level (130), mirroring P14-P16 plateau. The 'Spike' expected in P35 was delayed, not cancelled; history (P22, P24) suggests 120-130 demand is a precursor to 180-unit surges. Crash frequency (intervals 13, 9, 3) remains a background risk, but the immediate trend is upward/stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 demand (27) confirms a rigid 4-period cycle of crashes (P28, P32, P36). The pattern identifies a sequence of 'Crash -> Recovery -> High -> High'. Based on this, Period 37 corresponds to the 'Recovery' phase (historically 46-86 units), followed by a likely surge in Period 38. Current on-hand inventory (166) is extremely high relative to the expected recovery demand, so the system should likely order zero. We use N=4 to capture the volatility of the full cycle (Crash, Highs, and Recovery) to set appropriate safety stock for the subsequent surge risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: 4-Period Crash Cycle confirmed: P36 (27) matches the crash timing of P28 (26) and P32 (15) exactly (every 4 periods). The sequence 'Crash -> Recovery -> High -> High' is established. Period 37 is expected to be a moderate recovery (<100) before high demand returns in P38/P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $664.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 demand (169) confirmed an immediate, V-shaped recovery from the Period 36 crash (27), resulting in a stockout. This implies the 'recovery phase' is now accelerating directly to the high-volume regime. We are currently in the 'High' phase of the 4-period crash cycle (Crashes at P28, P32, P36 -> next predicted at P40). Period 38 and 39 are expected to be high-demand periods (similar to P31 which was 134, or P25 which was 179). Standard averaging methods are severely skewed by the P36 crash (27). Therefore, we use explicit parameters to target the high-volume regime (~155 mean) and ensure sufficient safety stock (sigma 40) to cover potential spikes up to ~185 units (observed in P30) before the next crash risk in P40.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Instant V-shaped recovery confirmed: Demand snapped from P36 crash (27) to P37 spike (169), skipping the intermediate recovery phase seen in P33. P38 and P39 are projected as 'High' periods before the cyclical crash risk returns in P40.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-189.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand was 0, a complete anomaly that contradicts recent high-volume patterns and the 4-period crash cycle. Historical cyclic patterns predicted high demand for P38. This zero-demand event significantly increases volatility estimates. Currently, on-hand inventory is 189 units, which covers even the historical maximum demand (187 units in P30). Given this buffer and the extreme uncertainty (demand could be 0 again or snap back to 170), the optimal move is to rely on recent history including the zero to dampen the forecast while preventing overstocking. 'recent_N' with N=5 captures the full range of the recent cycle (High-Crash-Spike-Zero), yielding a high variance but a suppressed mean, which effectively prevents further ordering while holding the current safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Anomaly P38 (0 demand demand) broke the established 4-period crash cycle and high-volume expectations. This is the first zero-demand occurrence, suggesting an extreme outlier or new instability. With on-hand inventory (189) covering historical max (187), risk of stockout is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 40 aligns precisely with a 4-period cyclical crash pattern observed at P28 (26), P32 (15), and P36 (27). If the cycle holds, demand in P40 could drop to ~25 units. However, the system is just recovering from an anomaly in P38 (0 units), with P39 demand reaching 94 (moderate recovery). Given the 4:1 critical fractile (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the cost of understocking a potential recovery/spike outweighs the holding cost of overstocking a crash. We use recent_N=4 to capture the full range of recent extreme volatility (0 to 169), creating a wide confidence interval (high sigma) to buffer against uncertainty while the mean (suppressed by the 0 and 27) naturally softens the order quantity slightly.

Carry-over insight: Period 39 demand (94) signals a functional recovery from the P38 zero-demand anomaly, though not yet returning to the P37 peak (169). The 4-period crash cycle (P28, P32, P36) identifies Period 40 as a high-probability crash window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 demand (177) significantly exceeded expectations, breaking the previously observed 4-period crash cycle (P28, P32, P36 implied P40 crash). This confirms the P38 zero-demand event was likely an anomaly or a disorderly cycle reset, rather than a reliable predictor. The current regime is characterized by extreme volatility (range 0 to 177 in last 3 periods). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 margin) versus holding cost ($1), and the tendency for demand to snap back to peaks of ~170-185, we utilize explicit parameters to target the upper demand bound. Statistical averages are currently depressed by the P38 zero-event and fail to generate sufficient stock for the high-end spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Crash cycle broken; demand surged to 177 instead of the expected cyclical low. This invalidates the strict 4-period crash pattern observed in P28-P36. Regime is now defined by extreme, non-cyclical volatility with high upside risk (peaks ~180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 demand (88) confirmed a 'Mid' level outcome following the P40 'High' (177). The 4-period crash cycle (active P28-P36) is definitively broken. The current regime appears bimodal, toggling between high peaks (~170-180) and moderate volatility (~90), with P38's zero demand as a singular outlier. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the priority is protecting against the upper demand bound (~180). Using 'recent_N' with N=2 captures the specific volatility of the last two periods (177 vs 88), generating a target base stock (~185) that safely covers the recurring high-demand peaks while reacting quickly if the trend dampens.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Bimodal volatility established: Demand oscillates between 'High' peaks (~177 in P40) and 'Mid' levels (~90 in P39, P41). This confirms the breakdown of the P28-P36 crash cycle. Current regime requires covering the ~180 upper bound despite lower averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 Decision: The demand regime remains highly volatile with a bimodal oscillation between 'High' peaks (~170-180) and 'Mid/Low' troughs (~70-94). Period 42 demand (70) was a low point, following the Period 40 peak (177) and Period 41 mid-point (88). The absence of a zero-demand crash since Period 38 suggests the system is stabilizing into this high-variance oscillation rather than the strict crash cycles seen earlier. History shows that after low/mid periods (like P42's 70), demand often snaps back to high levels (e.g., P37->P38, P21->P22->P23). Current on-hand inventory is 116. To sustain an 80% service level against potential peaks of ~180, we must set a base stock that covers this upside risk. We will use 'explicit' methods to target a base stock around ~190-200 to cover the high-end volatility, setting mu_hat slightly above the recent high average and sigma_hat to reflect the extreme range (std dev ~55).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Bimodal oscillation persists; P42 (70) confirms the lower bound of the current regime (~70-90), while peaks remain high (~177). The 4-period crash cycle appears defunct, replaced by random switching between high and low demand states.

Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (150) signaled a return to the 'High' state of the bimodal regime, breaking the short sequence of 'Mid' demands (P39: 94, P41: 88, P42: 70). The bimodal pattern (switching between ~70-90 and ~150-180) remains the dominant feature. Since demand just spiked to 150, and recent history shows clusters of high demand or rapid oscillation, we must prepare for the upper bound (~180) to avoid stockouts, as seen in Period 40. The 4-period crash cycle is defunct. With 46 units on hand, we are vulnerable to another high demand period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to smooth out the severe volatility (crashes to 15-27 and spikes to 170+) while capturing the elevated average necessary to serve the high perks. A shorter window risks under-ordering if a crash drops off the average, or over-reacting to a single point. N=10 covers the full P33-P43 window of extreme peaks and valleys. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal regime confirmed: Demand consistently alternates between 'Mid' cluster (~70-95) and 'High' cluster (~150-180), with P43 (150) marking a return to the High state.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 demand (115) fell between the previously identified 'High' (~170) and 'Mid/Low' (~80) clusters, suggestng the bimodal regime might be blurring into a general high-variance distribution. Lead time remains effectively 0 (orders traverse in same period). With a high cost of stockout ratio (4:1 profit/holding), maintaining service levels against the upper bound of recent volatility is priority. Using recent_N=5 for both mu and sigma captures the full mix of peaks (177, 150), troughs (70, 88), and intermediate values (115), resulting in a high variance estimate that naturally buffers the base stock target against potential spikes back to ~180.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand (115) bridges the gap between the prior bimodal clusters (Mid ~80 vs High ~170), indicating the regime has evolved into a high-variance continuous distribution rather than strictly two-state switching.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-117.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 saw a massive crash to 8 units. Historical patterns (P29->P30, P32->P34, P36->P37) strongly suggest this is a transient dip followed by a V-shaped recovery to the 150-180 range. Current inventory (149) covers average demand but is exposed to a max-demand spike. I am setting parameters to target the 'High' regime immediately to prevent stockouts during the rebound. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Extreme demand crash confirmed: Demand plummeted to 8 units, the lowest non-zero actual recorded. This likely signals a reset similar to P32/P36, predicting a sharp V-shaped recovery in P46/P47. The "bimodal" pattern has intensified into an "all-or-nothing" volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 demand (38) perfectly mirrors the 'Low Recovery' seen in Period 29 (46) following a crash. Historical patterns (P29->P30) strongly predict that the next period (P47) will see a massive 'Super-V' spike to the ~180 unit range. Current on-hand inventory (165) is substantial but likely insufficient to cover the projected maximum spike (historical max ~187). Given the high Critical Ratio (profit $4 vs holding $1), we must protect against a stockout during this anticipated surge. I am setting parameters to target a base stock of ~215 (covering max demand + safety stock), which will trigger a moderate top-up order.

Carry-over insight: Crash-Recovery-Spike pattern confirmed: Period 46 (38 units) replicates the P29 recovery step (46 units) that followed a crash, predicting a mirrored surge to ~180+ units in Period 47 (similar to P30).

Demand in P47 (103) confirms the recovery phase following the P45 crash. Historical patterns (P29-P30) suggest the next step is a 'Spike' to high volume (~150-180). Current on-hand (115) is likely insufficient for a peak event. Setting explicit target of 165 to cover expected surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Recovery confirmed: Demand rose to 103 (from P46's 38), validating the Crash-Recovery cycle. This mirrors the trajectory of P29-P30, predicting a continuation to 'High' demand (~150-180) in P48.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 confirmed a full recovery to the 'Super-High' demand regime (185 units), effectively mirroring the historical peaks seen in P23, P26, P30, and P40. History indicates that once a peak is reached (e.g., P30: 187), the subsequent period often sustains high demand (e.g., P31: 134) or remains in the high cluster (P23-P28) before crashing. Given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the penalty for underestimating demand during a peak phase is severe. Therefore, parameters are set explicitly to target this high-volume regime (~180 units) to maximize sales, assuming the crash risk is lower immediately following the first peak of a recovery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Peak demand sustained Period 48: Actual (185) confirms a full return to the ~180-190 max volume capability, completing the recovery cycle from P45. Historical patterns (P30-P31, P23-P24) suggest 'Peak' periods are rarely isolated events and are typically followed by another high-volume period (>130) before volatility risks re-emerge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 Context: We are in a high-volatility regime characterized by extreme swings ('crashes' down to single digits and 'spikes' up to ~185). The immediate history shows a classic recovery cycle: Crash (P45=8) -> Recovery Step (P46=38) -> Mid Recovery (P47=103) -> Peak Spike (P48=185). Period 49 (67 units) represents a drop-off following that peak, similar to the pattern seen after P40-P41. 

Lead Time: Consistently observed as 0 periods. 

Inventory Status: On-hand is 147. Given the volatility, we must protect against another sudden spike to the ~180 range, even though recent averages are lower. The P49 drop to 67 suggests the system is cooling off after the P48 peak, but the risk of alternating high demand remains. 

Parameter Strategy: The most effective strategy in this chaotic 'all-or-nothing' regime is to target the upper bound of demand to prevent stockouts during spikes, accepting some holding cost during troughs. The recent peak of 185 (P48) and 177 (P40) sets the target. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to the recent max (approx 185) to force the base stock high enough to cover another surge. Sigma will be set to reflect the massive standard deviation seen in the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak drop confirmed: P49 (67) followed the P48 peak (185), validating a pattern where extreme peaks are immediately followed by significant cooling off (e.g., P41->P42, P24->P25). Volatility remains extreme (range 8-185 in last 5 periods).
