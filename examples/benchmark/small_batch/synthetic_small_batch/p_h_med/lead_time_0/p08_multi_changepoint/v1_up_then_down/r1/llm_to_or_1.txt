Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. Initializing parameters based on provided historical data (samples: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71). The recent trend shows a decline, so using the recent 5 data points provides a reasonable baseline for the mean (approx 107.4) and standard deviation. Service level target is 80%. Lead time is assumed default (0) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 concluded with demand of 107, which aligns extremely well with the average of the provided historical samples (107.4). Actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods (ordered P1, arrived P1). Since the current game history (n=1) is insufficient for the backend to calculate a reliable standard deviation, I am using explicit parameters derived from the combined historical samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) and the recent observation (107). This sets a mean of approx 107.4 and a standard deviation of 20.2 (driven by historical variance), ensuring adequate safety stock for the high profit-margin item.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1); Demand P1 (107) matches historical average (107.4).

Daily Profit: $500.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $500.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2's demand (149) was a significant spike (+39% vs Period 1's 107) and exceeded all historical samples (max 130). This caused a stockout. Due to the high critical fractile (0.8) and the high cost of lost sales (4x holding cost), the policy must react aggressively to this new high-demand signal rather than dampening it with prior historical averages. I am using weighted 'explicit' parameters based on the realized game volatility (P1, P2) to target a higher base stock level ~153 units, protecting against repeated spikes. Lead time is reliably confirmed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 2 (149 vs P1 107), exceeding historical ranges. Lead time remains stable at 0.

=== Period 3 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=154, arrived=154 units (ordered on Period 3, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=154, demand=96, sold=96, ending on-hand inventory=58
Daily Profit: $384.00, Daily Holding Cost: $58.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 demand (96) dropped significantly from the Period 2 spike (149), confirming a high-volatility regime rather than a sustained increase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (all orders arrived same-period). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we maintain a responsive forecast using the last 3 periods (N=3) for both mean and volatility. This captures the recent variance (107, 149, 96) better than the longer history, ensuring buffer against another spike while acknowledging the P3 drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand erratic: P3 (96) sharp drop from P2 (149) confirms high volatility regime without sustained upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $319.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: Lead time is reliably 0 periods (immediate arrival). Demand history shows high volatility (P2 spike to 149) followed by a stabilization in P3-P4 (avg 94). The historical data sample for Period 5 (71) suggests a potential seasonal dip, but actual demand has been erratic. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), the strategy prioritizes availability. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat (~111) and sigma_hat (~26) to include the P2 spike in the statistics, creating a safety buffer against volatility while reacting to the recent downward trend. This balances the risk of a recurring spike against the potential seasonal low.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization P3-P4: Average 94 units, confirming P2 (149) was a transient spike rather than a trend shift.

Daily Profit: $500.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 6. Analyzing recent history: Demand for P1-P5 is 107, 149, 96, 92, 125. This yields an average of ~113.8. The most recent demand (P5: 125) was a jump back up from the lower P3-P4 levels (96, 92), suggesting volatility is persisting rather than stabilizing at a low mean. The observation of Period 2 (149) and Period 5 (125) indicates potential high-side spikes. Lead time consistently manifests as 0 periods (same-period arrival). With L=0, we need to cover demand for just the current period (Review Period R=1, L=0, R+L=1). I will set L to 'default' (0) as it is reliable. For demand (mu_hat), the recent fluctuation is significant. The 5-period average (113.8) is a reasonable central tendency, but given the volatility, a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 captures the full observed history of this session well without over-weighting the very low P3/P4 or the very high P2. For sigma_hat, the volatility is key (std dev of last 5 is approx 23.6). Using 'recent_N' with N=5 ensures the safety stock calculation accounts for this variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed continuing in Period 5 (125 units), bouncing back from P3-P4 lows (94 avg). No stable regime detected yet.

=== Period 6 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $404.00, Daily Holding Cost: $33.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7. Observation of Period 6 conclude shows demand of 101, which is a return to the lower baseline (~100) seen in P3/P4, contrasting with the spikes in P2 (149) and P5 (125). The actual lead time remains reliably 0 periods. Given the noisy but mean-reverting demand profile (Run Average ~112, but fluctuating between 92 and 149), I will use the full game history (N=6) for both mu and sigma. This approach avoids overreacting to the P6 drop while maintaining enough safety stock (via sigma of the full history) to handle potential future spikes like P2/P5. No missing shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: Period 6 demand (101) stabilized near the ~100 baseline, suggesting P2 (149) and P5 (125) were isolated spikes. High volatility persists, with run average ~112.

Daily Reward (R_t): $405.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: On-hand inventory is 23. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (promised matches observed). Demand in P6 (101) and P7 (107) indicates a stabilization trend compared to the high volatility seen in P2-P5 (range 92-149). To balance the high cost of stockouts (Critical Ratio 0.8) with this recent stabilization, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 (all observed game history) for both mean and standard deviation. This N=7 window captures the full distribution\u2014including the earlier spikes\u2014to maintain an adequate safety stock (~126 base stock) while recognizing the mean is settling around 111.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization observed P6-P7 (avg 104), suggesting earlier high volatility (P2-P5) may be subsiding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival). Demand in Period 8 dropped to 86, the lowest in the active game history, contradicting the stabilization observed in P6-P7. The overall demand pattern remains highly volatile (game range 86-149) with an average around ~108. Given the high cost of stockouts (4:1 profit/holding ratio) and zero lead time allowing immediate correction, we prioritize a robust safety stock. We use 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand and volatility parameters to capture the full recent distribution, including the significant spike in Period 2 (149) and the recent dip, avoiding over-reaction to the single low data point in P8.

Carry-over insight: Volatility hypothesis reinstated: P8 demand (86) broke the P6-P7 stability, confirming a wide, erratic demand range (86-149) rather than convergence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: Demand hit a game-low of 76 in Period 9. This drop closely mirrors the pre-game low of 71 (Period 5 pre-game), after which demand rebounded into the 100+ range. This suggests the recent dip is likely a cyclical floor or volatility fluctuation rather than a permanent downward trend. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the risk of stocking out during a potential rebound outweighs the holding cost risk. Therefore, I am using 'default' (full history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain a safer inventory buffer (mean ~105) rather than down-adjusting to the recent low signal. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical low detected: Period 9 demand (76) mirrors pre-game low (71), suggesting a recurring lower bound followed by rebound potential.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 demand (136) confirmed the rebound hypothesis from the P9 low (76), resulting in a stockout. Historical patterns (P2->P3, P5->P6) suggest that extreme spikes are typically followed by a reversion to the mean (~100) rather than sustained highs. Given the critical ratio of 0.8 favoring service, and the current on-hand of 0, we must replenish immediately. We utilize the full game window (N=10) for parameters to capture the true high usage volatility (ranges 76-149) while avoiding over-reaction to the single P10 spike, anticipating a likely moderation in P11.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike mean reversion pattern identified: Extreme demand peaks (P2: 149, P5: 125) are consistently followed by immediate drops to near-average levels (P3: 96, P6: 101). Anticipate P11 demand moderation after P10 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. On-hand is critical (4 units). Demand has remained high for two consecutive periods (P10: 136, P11: 123), averaging ~130. This confirms a high-demand variance regime similar to early game. I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=2 to aggressively weigh this recent surge and prevent stockouts, as the long-term mean (~109) is currently insufficient. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High demand cluster confirmed: Periods 10-11 averaged 129.5 units, significantly above the preceding P8-P9 lull (81 avg).

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (Reviewing P12): Demand in Period 12 (104) moderated significantly from the P10-P11 high cluster (avg ~129.5), aligning with the mean-reversion pattern identified previously. Although demand has returned to the long-term average (~108), the recent volatility range is extreme (from 76 in P9 to 136 in P10). Given the high Critical Ratio (0.8), avoiding stockouts is prioritized. Therefore, I will use a short-term moving average (N=3, avg ~121) for demand to maintain a buffer against potential rebounds, and a slightly longer window (N=5) for volatility to capture the full extent of the recent swings (from P8/P9 lows to P10/P11 highs). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Mean reversion confirmed: Period 12 demand (104) returned to baseline following the P10-P11 spike, validating the oscillator pattern. However, variance remains high (recent range 76-136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 established a new demand low (63 units), confirming the high-volatility oscillator pattern where deep troughs are typically followed by sharp rebounds (e.g., P9's 76 -> P10's 136). Actual lead time remains reliably 0. I strictly maintain lead time at default (0) and use recent_N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full breadth of the recent volatility (range 63-136). This ensures the safety stock calculation reflects the high variance and protects against the anticipated rebound, given the high cost of lost sales ($4) versus holding ($1).

Carry-over insight: Volatility range expansion: Period 13 demand (63) set a new all-time low. The demand pattern remains highly oscillatory with deep lows consistently followed by sharp rebounds (e.g., P9 76 -> P10 136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 demand (87) rebounded from the absolute low in Period 13 (63), consistent with the 'sawtooth' oscillatory pattern identified in carry-over insights. While the rebound (+24 units) was less explosive than the P9-P10 jump (+60 units), the volatility risk remains high. A very short memory (N=3) would average ~85, dangerously under-forecasting if a P10-style spike (136) recurs. A 5-period window (N=5) captures the full recent cycle\u2014including the high cluster (P10, P11) and the low cluster (P13)\u2014yielding a robust mean (~103) and standard deviation (~29) that better protects the 0.8 critical ratio service target.

Carry-over insight: Rebound confirmed but dampened: Period 14 (87) rose from the P13 low (63) as expected, validating the oscillatory regime, though the magnitude (+24 units) was weaker than the previous cycle's rebound (P9->P10 +60 units).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (immediate arrival). Demand in Period 15 (103 units) stabilized near the long-term average (~104), completing the recovery from the P13 low (63). Given the critical ratio of 0.8 (high cost of lost sales) and the historically oscillatory behavior (spikes up to 149), we prioritize a robust inventory position. We select 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mean and volatility to incorporate the full game history, ensuring the forecast captures both the deep lows (e.g., P13) and previous high spikes (e.g., P2, P10) to define an adequate safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Recovery to baseline complete: Period 15 demand (103) confirms a return to the long-term average (~104) following the P13 volatility dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand surged to an all-time high of 178 units, exceeding the previous record of 149 (Period 2) and causing a stockout. This continues the pattern of widening volatility (record low 63 in P13, record high 178 in P16). While historical patterns (P2->P3, P5->P6) suggest a mean reversion following such spikes, the possibility of clustered high demand (like P10-P11) requires a robust safety stock. We maintain 'default' lead time (consistently 0). We select 'recent_N' with N=10 for both demand and volatility; this window captures the full recent oscillatory range (including the P10, P11, and P16 highs as well as the P13 low), resulting in a stable mean forecast (~106) but a significantly elevated standard deviation to increase safety stock coverage against further volatility.

Carry-over insight: Volatility range expansion confirmed: Period 16 set a new all-time high demand (178), drastically widening the recent amplitude (vs P13 low of 63). The 'Spike-Reversion' pattern predicts a drop next, but the range of potential outcomes has expanded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: We have suffered consecutive stockouts in P16 and P17 due to a massive, sustained demand surge (P16: 178, P17: 222). This behavior breaks the previous 'spike-reversion' pattern; instead of dropping back to ~100, demand climbed higher. We are undoubtedly in a new high-demand regime. The historical average (~100) is now dangerously obsolete. To arrest the lost sales and adapt to this breakout trend, I am switching to a highly responsive `recent_N` (N=3) for both forecast and volatility. This focuses on the P15-P17 data (avg ~168, std ~60) to align stock levels with the new reality.

Carry-over insight: Regime Shift Confirmed: High demand persisted into Period 17 (222) following Period 16 (178), breaking the prior mean-reversion pattern. A new aggressive demand plateau is established, requiring responsive parameters (low N) to prevent continued stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 18 demand (146) dropped from the Period 17 peak (222) but remains significantly elevated compared to the pre-P16 baseline average (~100). This indicates that while the extreme spike may be subsiding, the system is still in a high-demand regime relative to history. With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 / Holding 1), the cost of stocking out is much higher than holding inventory. Strategy: We select recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window (Periods 16, 17, 18) captures the new high-demand reality (Avg ~182) and the immense volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover potential sustained high demand or secondary spikes while the regime stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime moderation: Period 18 demand (146) retreated 34% from the Period 17 peak (222) but remains ~40% above the long-term historical average (~104), confirming a sustained elevation rather than a full return to baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 demand (155) aligns with Period 18 (146), confirming that while the extreme peak of Period 17 (222) has passed, demand has stabilized at an elevated plateau (~150 units) well above the historical baseline (~105). The system is in a distinct high-demand regime starting Period 16. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N=4' to derive parameters exclusively from this active high-demand window (P16-P19). This yields a target mean (~175) that provides a safety buffer against recurrence of spikes like P17, justified by the high profit margin ($4) vs holding cost ($1). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Elevated plateau confirmed: Periods 18-19 averaged ~150.5 units, stabilizing well above the historical ~100 baseline but below the P17 peak. Volatility has decreased compared to the P16-P17 surge, suggesting a new sustained demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 concluded with demand of 98 units, a sharp drop from the Period 16-19 surge (averaging ~175 units). This signals a potential return to the historical baseline (~100-110 units) and breaks the recent 'elevated plateau'. However, given the high cost of stockouts (CR=0.8) and the extreme recent volatility (from 222 down to 98), it is risky to immediately revert to a low forecast. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this volatility. This averages the recent high points with the new low point, producing a safer buffer (approx mean ~160) than a responsive N=3 would, protecting against a potential rebound. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling signal P20: Demand dropped to 98, significantly below the P16-P19 high-demand cluster (avg 175). Suggests potential end of surge regime and return to baseline, though volatility remains high and requires buffering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $662.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand (172 units) sharply rebounded from the Period 20 low (98), falsifying the hypothesis that the high-demand regime was ending. The period P16-P21 block represents a distinct, high-volatility regime with an average demand of ~162 units and wide swings (range 98-222). Current on-hand inventory is critically low (26 units). Parameters are set using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to fully capture this elevated mean and high variance, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the true risk of large spikes like P17 or P21.

Carry-over insight: High-demand volatility persists: Period 21 (172) erased the 'cooling' signal of P20 (98). The regime since Period 16 remains elevated (avg ~162) and highly erratic (range 98-222), requiring wider safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $533.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 demand (146) further confirms the persistence of the high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approx 160 units, significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~100). The dip in Period 20 (98) appears as volatility within this elevated regime rather than a return to lower levels. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding), remaining responsive to this elevated mean is critical. I am setting N=7 for both mu and sigma to align the forecast horizon exactly with the start of this demand surge, ensuring the base stock level reflects the full distribution of this current regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility plateau confirmed: Period 22 (146) reinforces the elevated regime starting Period 16 (avg ~160). The oscillating pattern (e.g. P20 98 vs P21 172) indicates wide variance but a stable, high mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 demand (164) confirms the persistence of the high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is ~160 units, significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~100). The recent subset (P21-P23) also averages ~160, indicating stability within this elevated plateau. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and low current inventory (28 units), paramaters are set to capture the full statistics of this new regime (N=8) to ensure sufficient safety stock against the observed volatility (range 98-222). Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime firmly established: Periods 16-23 average ~160 units (vs ~100 historical). Volatility remains high (range 98-222), but the mean has stabilized around this new elevated level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 demand (124) confirms the ongoing high-demand regime established in Period 16. The average demand for the current regime (Periods 16-24) is approximately 156 units, significantly higher than the earlier ~100 baseline. While Period 24 dipped slightly below this average, the pattern remains volatile (ranging from 98 to 222). There is no sign of a reversion to the pre-P16 low levels. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit) vs holding ($1), maintaining robust service levels is critical. I will continue using a short-term 'recent_N' window (N=9, covering the regime start at P16) to capture this elevated mean and high variance without diluting it with older, lower data.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand since Period 16 defines a high-volatility regime with an average of ~152 units, significantly above the historical ~105 baseline. While recent periods P24-P25 show a cooling trend (124, 112), a similar dip occurred at P20 (98) followed immediately by a spike to 172. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding), we prioritize service level. We use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for both mean and volatility to capture the full distribution of this elevated regime (including peaks like 222 and 178) rather than over-reacting to the recent short-term dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend detected: Periods 24-25 averaged 118 units, dropping below the post-P16 regime average of ~152. This suggests a possible reversion to the historical mean (~105), though volatility remains a risk (recall P20 dip followed by P21 spike).

Daily Reward (R_t): $538.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (144) interrupted the previous softening trend (P24-25 avg 118), suggesting the demand regime has not fully reverted to the historical baseline (~100) but rather stabilized at a moderately high level. The average over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 138 units, significantly above the pre-surge norm. Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) favors service level, we use a responsive 5-period window to capture this ongoing elevated activity and volatility without overreacting to the single P26 spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand bounce-back: Period 26 (144) reversed the softening trend of P24-25 (avg 118), indicating a persistent 'moderately high' regime (avg ~138 over P22-P26) rather than a clean reversion to the ~100 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand surged to 181, causing a stockout and decisively ending the brief 'softening' trend observed in P24-25. This confirms the high-volatility, elevated-demand regime that began in Period 16 is still fully active. The average demand across this entire regime (P16-P27) is approximately 153.5 units, with large swings (min 98, max 222). To maintain adequate service levels against this variance, I am setting N=12 for demand and volatility estimation, which captures the full history of this regime including the initial spikes. Lead time consistently observed as 0.

Carry-over insight: High-volatility regime resurgence: Period 27 demand (181) caused a stockout, confirming a return to the intense variance seen in P16-P19 (regime avg ~153) after a brief lull in P24-25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $728.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 demand (212) continued the surge from Period 27 (181), causing consecutive stockouts. This pattern mirrors the P16-P17 double-peak (178->222), suggesting we are in a 'Super-Peak' cluster. While P18 saw a reversion, the cost of lost sales ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1), forcing an aggressive stance. We switch `mu_hat` to `recent_N` (N=3) to rapidly align with the elevated short-term mean (~179) and use `recent_N` (N=5) for `sigma_hat` to capture the broader volatility (std ~41), aiming for a base stock (~213) that covers the current peak levels.

Carry-over insight: Recurring High-Demand Cluster: P27-P28 demand (181, 212) replicates the P16-P17 surge pattern (178, 222), confirming that extreme peaks can cluster in pairs before potential reversion. Previous 'softening' signals (P24-P25) were false flats in a high-volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $661.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 analysis: The high-demand, high-volatility regime initiated in Period 16 remains dominant. Period 29 demand (175) follows the extreme peaks of P27-P28 (181, 212), confirming a sustained 'surge' pattern rather than immediate mean reversion. The average demand since P16 is ~160 units, significantly above the historical ~100 baseline. Crucially, P29 demand (175) is very close to P21 demand (172) and P16 (178), reinforcing a dense cluster of outcomes in the 170-220 range. Although demand dipped slightly from the P28 peak, 175 is still extremely high. The stockout in P27 and P28 was severe; P29 recovered only slightly to 39 ending inventory. Given the persistent high variance (range 98-222) and the repeating 'double/triple peak' pattern, backing off now risks another stockout. I will maintain a short memory window (recent_N=5) to capture this elevated average (~165 over last 5 periods) and high deviations without diluting the signal with older, lower data.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand plateau: P29 demand (175) confirms the third consecutive period of extreme demand (P27:181, P28:212), firmly establishing a new upper-tier regime significantly above the post-P16 average of ~160.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 31. Demand in Period 30 (127) dipped significantly from the preceding extreme cluster (P27-P29 avg ~189), but remains well above the historical pre-P16 baseline (~100). This pattern mirrors previous temporary cool-downs (e.g., Periods 24-25) within the sustained high-volatility regime. Since Period 16, the average demand is ~157 with peaks exceeding 200. To prevent stockouts during likely rebounds while acknowledging the recent moderation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (capturing the P27-P30 cluster and the P26 transition). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation in high-volatility regime: Period 30 (127) dropped from P27-P29 highs (avg 189), repeating the pattern of temporary dips (e.g., P20, P24-25) seen throughout the elevated regime (avg ~157 since P16). Pattern suggests volatility, not regime end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $519.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. We remain in a high-volatility, elevated demand regime initiated in Period 27. The most recent demand (P31: 143) indicates a stabilization above the historical baseline (~100) but below the extreme peaks of P28 (212). The last 5 periods (P27-P31) average ~168 units with significant variance (range 127-212). Given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, stockout protection is critical. I am selecting 'recent_N = 5' for both mu and sigma to fully incorporate the high average and volatility of this current surge cluster, ensuring the base stock level buffers against potential rebounds toward 200+.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand stabilization in elevated regime: Demand (143) ticked up from P30's low (127), maintaining a high recent average (~148 last 3 periods) compared to history. Extreme volatility persists (range 127-212 in last 5 periods), confirming the surge cluster has not fully reverted to baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $514.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 demand (142) aligns nearly perfectly with Period 31 (143), confirming a temporary stabilization around the ~142 level, although still well above the historical ~105 baseline. The overall regime since Period 16 remains characterized by high demand (avg ~157) and extreme volatility (peaks >200). We have seen clusters of shocks (P16-17, P27-29) followed by slightly calmer plateaus. Currently, we are in a high plateau. Given the zero lead time and no pipeline inventory, the 54 units on-hand cover only ~38% of expected demand. We must reorder aggressively to cover the full expected demand plus a volatility buffer. I will use a recent_N=6 window for mu_hat (avg ~163) to capture the high-demand cluster starting from the P27 spike, and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the associated volatility (range 127-212). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization in high-demand regime: Periods 31-32 demand (143, 142) are nearly identical, suggesting a momentary steady state around 142 units, significantly above the historical average but below the recent peaks (>200).

Daily Reward (R_t): $760.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand spiked to 198, causing a stockout and confirming that the high-volatility regime is active. The brief stability of P31-P32 was temporary. Using recent_N=5 for mu to capture the immediate cluster average (~157) and centered on the active high-demand pattern. Sigma uses recent_N=10 to encompass the broader volatility range of this regime. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatile surge recurring: P33 demand triggered a stockout (198 demand), breaking the P31-P32 stability (~142) and mirroring the P27-P29 cluster. High-demand regime (avg ~157 since P16) persists with unpredictable spikes.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 35. Demand in Period 34 (147) moderated from the Period 33 spike (198), consistent with the established 'sawtooth' behavior of the current regime where extreme peaks are often followed by a reversion to the ~145-155 range. The overall regime since Period 16 remains highly elevated (avg ~160) compared to history (~100), with significant variance. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs during the 'reversion' phases, I will use a 10-period rolling window for both mean and variance. This captures the full recent cluster of spikes (P28, P29, P33) and lulls (P30-P32) to set a robust base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Sawtooth pattern persistence: P34 demand (147) dropped from P33 spike (198), confirming that extreme peaks in this high-demand regime are naturally unstable and tend to revert quickly to a ~145-155 plateau rather than sustaining >190 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $669.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 demand (171) rebounded strongly from Period 34 (147), maintaining the high-volatility regime observed since Period 16. The most recent 10-period average is ~164 units, significantly above the historical baseline of ~100. With ending inventory critically low at 15 units and recent peaks reaching 198 (P33) and 212 (P28), the risk of stockout is high. I am setting both mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10. This window (Periods 26-35) captures the full extent of the recent volatility cluster, including the extreme peaks in P28 and P33 which shorter windows would miss, ensuring the safety stock calculation accounts for the true variance of this erratic plateau.

Carry-over insight: High flux persistence: Period 35 demand (171) rebounds from P34 (147), reinforcing the volatile regime established in P16. Current 10-period average ~164 confirms a high, unstable plateau requiring larger history windows (N=10) to capture peak risks (e.g., P28's 212).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 demand collapsed to an all-time low of 46, creating extreme uncertainty. While this lowers the short-term average, historical patterns (e.g., P13, P20) suggest deep lows are often followed by sharp rebounds. We adopt a cautious N=5 for mean demand (avg ~140) to reflect the drop without over-correcting, while maintaining a wider N=10 for sigma to account for the massive variance (range 46-222).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand crash to all-time low (46), sharply breaking the sustained high-demand pattern (>140). This extreme outlier expands the known volatility range (46-222) and suggests the regime may be destabilizing or resetting, though immediate rebound risk remains high based on history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 demand (95) represents a partial rebound from the Period 36 crash (46), but remains well below the recent high-regime average (~155). This pattern (deep low -> partial recovery) mirrors previous sequences (e.g., P13->P14) which eventually led back to demand surges. Given the high critical ratio (4:1) and the documented history of 'fakeout' dips followed by spikes (e.g., P20->P21), it is risky to downshift parameters too aggressively based on just two data points. We maintain a broader 10-period window to capture the legitimate high-demand risks (peaks >200) and the extreme volatility (range 46-222). Lead times remain stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Partial recovery pattern detected: Period 37's rebound (95) from the P36 low (46) mirrors the P13-P14 sequence (63->87) that preceded a major regime surge. Caution advised: low demand now does not guarantee low demand next period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand is recovering (95->111) from the P36 crash (46) but remains below the prior high-demand plateau (~160). I am using recent_N=10 for both mu and sigma (avg ~143) to balance the recent lows with the sustained high demand seen just 4 periods ago, maintaining a robust buffer against the proven high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recovery trend confirmed: P38 demand (111) continues the rebound from P36 low (46), suggesting the system is stabilizing back toward the 100-120 range rather than staying at the crash lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (93 units) confirms the stabilization trend observed in P37-P38 (95, 111). The 3-period average (99.7) aligns almost perfectly with the pre-surge historical baseline of Period 1-15 (avg ~105), suggesting the 'High Demand Surge' (P16-P35) has concluded and the system has reverted to its normal state following the P36 crash. Given this strong signal of mean reversion, 'mu_hat' is set to a short-term window (N=3) to aggressively track the new, lower demand level (~100) and avoid over-ordering. However, to hedge against the residual risk of the recently volatile environment (ranges 46-222), 'sigma_hat' uses a longer window (N=10) to maintain a robust safety stock buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Baseline reversion confirmed: Periods 37-39 (avg ~99.7) have stabilized near the historical ~100 unit baseline, effectively ending the P16-P35 high-demand regime. The low P39 demand (93) reinforces this return to norm, though latent system volatility risk remains.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (100 units) confirms the return to a stable baseline (100 units average P37-P40) following the P16-P35 high-demand regime. Using recent_N(4) for mu_hat captures this current demand level accurately (~100). However, the historical baseline (P1-P15) contained occasional spikes (e.g., 125, 136, 149). A short-term sigma would underestimate this risk (N=4 sigma is only ~7). Therefore, I use recent_N(10) for sigma_hat to include the tail of the volatile period (P31-P36) and the crash, generating a wider safety buffer (~40) to target a base stock of ~135. This protects against characteristic random spikes without overstocking for the previous 160+ mean.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 Observation: Demand in Period 41 was 84 units, following 100 in P40 and 93 in P39. The recent trend (last 6 periods: 46->95->111->93->100->84) shows a clear stabilization around a mean of ~88 units, significantly lower than the turbulent P16-P35 regime (which averaged ~157). The massive 46-unit outlier in P36 seems to have marked the end of the high-volatility surge. Current demand consistently hovers near or slightly below the long-term history typical of the pre-surge era (approx 100). Lead time remains reliably 0 periods. Given the lower mean and reduced variance, I will switch to shorter-term recent history (N=5) to capture this new stable, lower-demand reality quickly, preventing overstocking based on the old high-demand history. 84 units is slightly below the recent 5-period average (~96), signaling potentially further softening or just noise around the new baseline. Parameters are adjusted to reflect this 'calm after the storm' regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand stability confirmed: Periods 37-41 average ~96 units with reduced volatility (range 84-111, excluding outlier), strongly indicating the high-demand regime (P16-P35) has concluded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $225.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 demand (66 units) dropped significantly, marking the lowest non-crash demand since the game start period. This confirms the high-demand regime is fully concluded and indicates a potential shift to a subordinate low-demand tier (average ~91.5 over P37-P42). To prevent overstocking while managing this downward trend, we switch estimating parameters to 'recent_N = 6', strictly using data since the P36 crash/reset. This excludes all prior high-volatility data (P16-P35) from the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand trend deepening: Period 42 (66) is the lowest demand since the P36 crash, pulling the P37-P42 average down to ~91.5 (below historical ~100). Validates strategy to decouple from pre-P36 high-demand history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 44. The system is in a 'Post-Crash' regime established since Period 37, with demand significantly lower than the mid-game surge. While the overall regime average (P37-P43) is ~87 units, recent periods show a deepening softening trend (P42: 66, P43: 61). However, given the high profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), risking stockouts by over-tuning to the very recent lows is dangerous. We select N=7 (the full length of the current stability regime) to capture higher demand instances (e.g., P38: 111) and maintain adequate safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend deepening: Periods 42-43 avg (63.5) dropped well below the earlier post-crash baseline (P37-P41 avg ~96), suggesting the regime is settling into a lower equilibrium.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 demand (90) rebounded from the recent lows (P42: 66, P43: 61), contradicting the 'deepening low' hypothesis and suggesting the P42-P43 dip was the bottom of a cycle within the post-crash regime. Since the crash in Period 36, demand has stabilized in a new range (approx 60-110, excluding the P36 outlier). To optimize for this regime, we use N=8 (Periods 37-44) to exclude the transition outlier (P36: 46) while capturing the full volatility of the current stabilization, including peaks like P38 (111). Current inventory (13) is critically low given the average demand (~88) and 0-period lead time, requiring an immediate replenishment up to the new base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-crash oscillation confirmed: P44 demand (90) reversed the P42-P43 dip (avg 63.5), establishing the P37-P44 regime as a stable oscillation (avg ~88, range 61-111) rather than a continued decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 Analysis: The system has stabilized into a lower demand regime following the Period 36 crash. Recent demand (P37-P45) averages ~89 units, significantly below the prior surge levels. However, P45 ending inventory is critically low (2 units) due to a slight uptick in demand (100 in P45 vs 90 in P44). Lead time remains reliably 0. 

Strategy: While the long-term trend appears to be a lower equilibrium, the immediate risk is stockout due to the depleted buffer (2 units). I will continue using a short memory window (recent_N = 8, covering the post-crash stabilization period starting P37) to capture the current lower mean/variance while discarding the irrelevant high-demand history. This ensures the target stock adapts to the new 'normal' (~90-100 units) without overreacting to the P16-P35 volatility. The extremely low on-hand position necessitates a robust replenishment, which the OR logic will handle given the current gap between base stock and inventory.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand stabilization continues: P45 demand (100) aligns with the post-crash average (P37-P45 avg ~89), confirming a stable regime significantly below the P16-P35 surge levels.

Period 48/50. Current status: On-hand is critical (10 units), requiring an immediate accurate order (L=0). Demand in Period 47 (81) rebounded from the P46 low (53), signaling that the recent 'softening' trend was likely variance within the post-crash regime (range 53-111). The cost of stockouts ($4 margin) significantly outweighs holding costs ($1), justifying a buffer against upper-tail demand volatility. We use N=10 (covering the post-crash stability P38-P47, avg ~84) rather than a shorter window like N=5 (avg ~77) to ensure we cover demand spikes like P45 (100) or P38 (111). Promised L=0 verified by P47 observed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Post-crash regime oscillation confirmed: Period 47 demand (81) rebounded from the P46 low (53), establishing a choppy 50-110 range (avg ~80) for the final periods rather than a consistent downward trend.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. Demand in Period 48 (80) aligns closely with Period 47 (81) and the post-crash average (~84.5), confirming stabilization in the low-demand regime active since Period 37. The extreme volatility of the P16-P35 surge is absent. Given the current low inventory (20 units) and reliable Lead Time = 0 (observed consistently), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=12. This window (P37-P48) captures the full extent of the current stable regime while excluding the irrelevant high-demand history, ensuring base stock levels (~100 units) are appropriate for the expected ~85 unit demand.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand stabilization confirmed: P47-P48 demand (81, 80) shows reduced volatility and aligns with the post-crash baseline (P37-P48 avg ~84.5), indicating a steady state significantly below the historical ~100 norm.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 (Final). The demand landscape has firmly settled into a low-volume, stable regime (P45-P49 avg ~81 units), significantly below the earlier high-volatility surge. With a consistent Lead Time of 0, immediate responsiveness is possible. We select 'recent_N=5' for both demand mean and volatility to accurately target this specific low-level baseline (~80-90 units) for the final period. This approach provides sufficient safety stock to capture Profit ($4) versus Holding Cost ($1) without relying on outdated high-demand data from the mid-game surge.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime stability confirmed: Period 49 demand (89) aligns with recent 5-period average (~81), maintaining the post-crash equilibrium.
