Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. As this is the first period, we have no historical observations or lead time data beyond the initial parameters. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1 (CR=0.8). Historical demand samples provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) suggest an average demand around 101.8 and a downward trend or volatility. Since I have no in-game observations yet, I will use the provided historical samples as a prior. I'll rely on the default method (using all available history) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to establish a baseline. Promised lead time is 0, so L starts at default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $329.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 concluded with actual Lead Time 0. Demand was 91, which is slightly lower than the provided historical average of ~102. Current inventory is 35 (low). Since we only have 1 period of actual game history, 'recent_N' or 'default' for sigma would likely result in 0 or error. Therefore, I will use explicit values based on the provided historical samples to ensure safety stock is calculated. L remains default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3, on-hand 0. Observed demand (P1: 91, P2: 130) shows high volatility and deviates significantly from the provided static historical data samples (P1: 141, etc.), so I am relying exclusively on the actual Game History. P2 experienced a stockout (Demand 130 > Available 126). Given the short history and 0-period lead time consistency, I am using the default method (all available history) to establish a baseline forecast and safety stock that covers the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliably 0 periods (confirmed P1-P2 observations).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 Check: The 'Historical Demand Data' in the prompt (141, 118, 67...) contradicts the actual 'Game History' logs (91, 130, 114). I am disregarding the static data block and relying entirely on the live Game History logs. Observed demand in P1-P3 is [91, 130, 114], with a mean of ~112. Lead time has been consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for all parameters to reflect the immediate history of this specific run.

Daily Reward (R_t): $461.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 5. Product: chips(Regular). 

Lead Time: History consistently confirms a 0-period lead time (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Method remains 'explicit' value 0 or 'default' (since promised is likely 0). I will use 'default' as the system promised lead time matches observations.

Demand Analysis: 
History:
P1: 91
P2: 130
P3: 114
P4: 118
P5 (from samples provided in prompt description): 89. 
(Note: The game history log shows demand = 91, 130, 114, 118 for periods 1-4. The prompt's 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section lists slightly different samples: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. I must prioritize the actual observed game history 'Period X conclude' messages for the most accurate recent trend, but since I am in Period 5, I have observed P1-P4 actuals: 91, 130, 114, 118. Average of these 4 is ~113. 

The 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided in the prompt instructions often represents a static prior or external dataset, whereas the 'GAME HISTORY' is what actually happened in this run. I will weight the actual game history heavily. 
Observed history (P1-P4): [91, 130, 114, 118]. Mean = 113.25. 
I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this high-demand regime, as it differs from the static samples provided in the instructions.

Inventory Status:
On-hand: 11. Pipeline: 0. 
With L=0, we need to cover just Period 5's demand. The base stock will be calculated as mu + z*sigma. 
Safety stock is crucial here as stockouts occurred in P2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. Lead time remains consistently observed at 0 periods (immediate arrival in same period). Demand over the first 5 periods (91, 130, 114, 118, 106) averages ~112 with some volatility (std dev ~14.5). I am prioritizing the specific Game History logs over the generic historical samples provided in the instructions, as the logs reflect the actual simulation reality. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full observed range (including the high of 130) to ensure the safety stock covers potential fluctuations given the 0.8 critical ratio.

Daily Profit: $184.00, Daily Holding Cost: $79.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand (46 units) was a significant outlier compared to the prior average (~112), causing a sharp increase in observed volatility. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding cost ($1), avoiding stockouts is the priority. I am setting parameters using recent_N=6 to include this low datapoint; this lowers the mean forecast slightly but increases the standard deviation (and thus safety stock), providing a buffer if demand rebounds to previous levels while acknowledging the downside risk. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly in Period 6: 46 units (-60% vs previous avg) significantly increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 observation. Inventory is 40 units. Confirmed lead time remains consistently 0 periods (Period 7 order arrived in Period 7). Demand in Period 7 (86 units) partially recovered from the Period 6 dip (46 units) but remains below the P2-P5 average (~117 units). Given the high volatility introduced by P6 and the potentially softening demand in P7, using a 5-period window is optimal. This window (Periods 3-7) captures the stable high-demand periods alongside the recent downturn, providing a balanced mean and a standard deviation that accounts for the recent instability without overreacting to the single anomaly in P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 decision. Lead time is reliably 0. Demand in Period 8 (103) confirms a strong recovery from the Period 6 anomaly (46), returning close to the historical average (~100). Using recent_N=8 (entire game history) for demand parameters effectively blends the recent volatility with the earlier stable high-demand periods, resulting in a mean approx 99 and high sigma, which sets a robust safety stock target (~121 total inventory) to protect against demand fully restoring to pre-shock levels (>110).

Carry-over insight: Recovery confirmed: Demand rebounded P6(46) -> P7(86) -> P8(103), suggesting P6 was a transient outlier and levels are returning to ~100 mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 decision analysis:

1. Lead Time: All historical orders (P1-P9) consistently arrived in 0 periods. The system is reliable with no delays or lost orders identified. I will continue using 'default' (promised L=0) as it matches the observed 'calculate' value of 0.0.

2. Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized after the Period 6 anomaly (46). The sequence since the dip is P7(86) -> P8(103) -> P9(98). The most recent 3 periods average (86+103+98)/3 = 95.67 units. This is very close to the pre-dip average (P1-P5 avg ~112, excluding the P6 outlier). The variance is relatively low in this recovery phase.

3. Parameter Selection:
   - L: 'default' (0 periods) is robust.
   - mu_hat: Using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the post-anomaly stabilization trend (avg ~96) without being weighed down by the low outlier in P6 or the potentially higher initial demand in P1-P2. This allows the system to target inventory for the current steady state.
   - sigma_hat: Using 'recent_N' with N=3 is appropriate here as well. The standard deviation over the last 3 periods (86, 103, 98) is roughly 8.7, which is much tighter than the full history volatility caused by the P6 dip. This prevents overstocking due to inflated historical variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: Stocked out in Period 10 due to a demand spike of 137 units, which significantly exceeds the post-dip recovery levels (P7-P9 avg ~96). The demand history now shows extreme volatility over result periods (range 46 to 137 in the last 5 periods). To address this, we shift mu_hat to a short 'recent_N=3' window (avg ~113) to capture the higher recent demand signal and exclude the outlier dip in P6. We set sigma_hat to 'recent_N=5' to explicitly account for the widened variance (both the low of 46 and high of 137) in the safety stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: High volatility confirmed: Demand range widened to [46, 137] in last 5 periods, causing stockout in P10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: Lead time consistently observed as 0 periods (instant arrival for demand satisfaction). Demand in P11 (86) normalized after the P10 spike (137). High profit margin ($4 vs $1) favors a higher service level. To support this, we select 'recent_N' with N=10 for all parameters. This window (P2-P11) captures the full volatility spectrum, including the P6 low (46) and P10 high (137). Including these extremes increases the volatility estimate (sigma), which appropriately boosts the safety stock to prevent stockouts against future spikes, maximizing profit capture.

Demand pattern analysis: Following the outlier dip in Period 6 (46), demand has stabilized somewhat but remains volatile. Recent demand history (P8-P12): 103, 98, 137, 86, 87. The P10 spike (137) is the highest recent value, causing a stockout. The mean of the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 102.2. The standard deviation over this period is roughly 20.8. Given the lead time L=0, the target base stock covers only the current period's demand (L+1=1). We will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the recent volatility (the recovery from P6 and the spike in P10) without being too weighed down by the P6 dip which is now 7 periods ago. Service level target is 80% (q=0.8).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is critically low (2 units) following high demand in Period 13 (118). Demand volatility remains significant in the last 5 periods (Range: 86-137, Mean: ~105), while the low anomaly from Period 6 (46) is now distant. With a 0-period lead time, we can replenish immediately. We select N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the recent higher-variance regime (including the P10 spike of 137 and P13's 118) while dropping older, lower data points. This ensures the base stock level is reactive enough to prevent stockouts given the decent profit margins ($4 vs $1 cost).

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime persists: recent 5-period demand bounds [86, 137] with mean ~105, requiring robust safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $431.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: Lead time remains reliably 0. Demand history shows continued volatility with a recent range of [86, 137] over the last 5 periods (avg ~108). The low outlier in Period 6 is receding into history, but the Period 10 spike (137) keeps volatility estimates high. Given the high stockout cost (ratio 0.8), we maintain a responsive forecast using the last 5 periods to capture this higher mean and variance, ensuring adequate safety stock against potential spikes like P10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand inventory is 50. Demand in P15 dropped to 77, showing continued high volatility (recent highs >110, recent low 46). The 5-period mean is approx 96. To balance the high holding cost risk against the stockout risk (Profit/Holding ratio 0.8), I use a 5-period window for mu_hat to be responsive to the recent fluctuation, but a wider 10-period window for sigma_hat to capture the full recent risk profile (including the spike to 137 in P10). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Erratic volatility persists; demand dropped to 77 in P15 after highs of 118/111. High variance strategy required as 10-period range is [46, 137].

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 experienced a massive demand spike to 273 units, far exceeding any previous observation (previous max ~141). This caused a complete stockout. This 273 is an extreme outlier (possibly a seasonal event or promotional spike) compared to the recent average ~100. Given the erratic history (Period 6=46, Period 10=137, Period 16=273), demand is highly volatile. While the 273 might be a one-off, I must react to the increased variance risk. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to dampen the impact of the single outlier while raising the baseline, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to explicitly capture this recent high volatility in the safety stock calculation. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike in Period 16: 273 units (previous max ~141). This 2.7x increase over average signifies extreme tail risk or a major event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $665.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: Demand has undergone a massive surge in the last two periods (P16: 273, P17: 170), significantly exceeding the historical average of ~100. This indicates a 'high demand' regime or event. While P17 dropped from the P16 peak, it remains 70% above baseline. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), stocking out is costly. We select recent_N=3 for mu and sigma to capture this new elevated mean (~173) and extreme volatility (std dev ~98), ensuring we cover potential continued high demand or another spike. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Major demand surge confirmed: P16 (273) and P17 (170) indicate a new volatile high-demand regime, averaging ~221 over the last 2 periods vs historical ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $904.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. The demand surge starting in Period 16 is now confirmed as a sustained high-volume regime (P16: 273, P17: 170, P18: 232). The average over this 3-period block is ~225 units, which is more than double the historical baseline of ~100. P18's rebound to 232 proves P17 was not a return to normal. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding), we must prioritize service level. I am shifting parameters to strictly track this short-term 'surge' regime (N=3) to prevent stockouts like in P16. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P16-P18 avg ~225 units (vs historical ~100). P18 rebound to 232 indicates volatility remains extremely high within this new elevated band.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20. Lead time remains stably 0. The demand pattern shows a significant break: after a 3-period high-demand surge (P16-18, avg ~225), Period 19 dropped sharply to 116, which is consistent with the pre-surge historical mean (~100-120). This suggests the extreme demand event might be concluding, or volatility has just widened to include the lower bound. Given the high cost of understocking (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), it is risky to immediately revert to a low forecast. We utilize a short memory (N=4) for both mu and sigma. This blends the recent drop (116) with the surge data (273, 170, 232) to produce a robust target (~198 mean) and high safety stock, protecting against a potential rebound while beginning to adjust downwards if the trend persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand signal mixed: P19 dropped to 116 after P16-18 surge (avg 225), signaling potential end of extreme regime or widened volatility [116, 273].

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 demand (164) rebounded from Period 19's dip (116), confirming that while the extreme peaks of P16-18 (avg ~225) may have softened, we are not back to the historical baseline of ~100. The last 5 periods [273, 170, 232, 116, 164] show high volatility with an average of ~191. Given the high stockout cost ($4 vs holding $1), we prioritize service level. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this full window of turbulence and ensure adequate safety stock against another potential surge.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime continues: P20 rebound to 164 confirms demand remains elevated above historical ~100 baseline. 5-period average is ~191 with wide swings [116, 273].

Daily Reward (R_t): $657.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 demand (180) confirms the sustained high-demand regime established since Period 16. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is ~189 units, drastically higher than the early game average of ~100. Lead time remains reliably 0. To prevent stockouts (which are costly with a 4:1 profit-to-holding ratio) while avoiding massive overstocking, I am setting parameters based on the last 6 periods. This window (N=6) captures the entire duration of the current demand shift, including the initial spikes and recent stabilization, ensuring the volatility calculation accurately reflects the risk of surges >200 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand plateau: Avg demand for P16-P21 is ~189 units (vs historic ~100). The regime appears structural rather than transient, with a floor around 116 and ceiling near 273.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: Demand in Period 22 was 189, perfectly aligning with the recent high-demand regime average (P16-P22 avg ~189). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The demand shock from Period 16 has settled into a structural plateau with a mean nearly double the historical average (~100 -> ~189) but with significant variance (Standard Deviation ~50). To maximize profit (Service Level ~80%), we focus strictly on the post-shift data. Using N=7 captures the entire high-demand epoch (P16-current) without trailing low-demand data dragging down the forecast.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: We are deep into a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the recent history (P16-P23), demand has shifted from a historical mean of ~100 to a new elevated plateau. Recent demands: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, 187. The average over this 8-period window is ~189 units. The last three periods (P21-P23) have shown remarkable stability around 180-190 units (180, 189, 187), suggesting the extreme volatility of the transition phase (P16-P20) is settling into a consistent high-volume pattern. Lead time remains reliably 0. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding), we must maintain service levels for this new ~190 mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (since the shift start at P16) to capture the full high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock reflects the new reality rather than the outdated history. N=8 covers the entire duration of the shift.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilizing: After the initial surge (P16-P20), demand has stabilized in the 180-190 range for the last 3 periods (P21-P23 avg ~185).

While recent periods (P21-P23) showed stabilization around 185, the uptick to 203 serves as a reminder of the volatility in this regime (range [116, 273]). To avoid stockouts with only 26 units on hand, I am selecting N=9 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16 to P24) for demand estimation. This captures the true mean (~190) and the necessary variance (including the P16 spike) to buffer against potential upward swings. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime fully entrenchment (Periods 16-24): The 9-period average is ~190 units, significantly above the historical ~100. Period 24 (203) broke the recent tight cluster (180-190), indicating variance remains active. Parameters must now treat P16-P24 as the baseline sample.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
High-demand regime (started P16) is stable. Last 5 periods average ~188 units with low variance compared to the initial surge. Using N=10 captures the entire high-demand window (P16-P25) correctly for both mean and safety stock calculations.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilized: P21-P25 demands [180, 189, 187, 203, 180] show tight clustering around mean ~188, confirming the structural shift from Period 16 is robust and less erratic than initially observed.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (187) aligns perfectly with the stable high-demand plateau observed since Period 21 (recent range [180, 203], average ~188). While the last 6 periods have been stable, the current regime (active since Period 16) has a history of volatility (peaks of 232, 273). To balance efficiency with safety against recurring volatility, I am setting parameters based on the full regime history (N=11, P16-P26). This captures the robust mean (~189) and maintains a wider safety stock buffer than a short-term N=6 window would, protecting against potential spikes >200 seen earlier in this regime. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $387.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Demand in Period 27 dropped to 122 units, breaking the recent stable cluster (P21-P26 avg ~188). This significant dip (-35%) mirrors the behavior seen in Period 19 (116 units), suggesting it may be a volatility spike within the high-demand regime rather than a structural collapse. The average demand since the regime shift (P16-P27, N=12) remains ~184 units. Since the cost of stockouts ($4) heavily outweighs holding costs ($1), it is safer to maintain inventory based on the full regime average rather than reacting aggressively to the single low data point. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime volatility returns: Period 27 demand dropped to 122 (-35% from P26), resembling the P19 dip (116). The regime defined by P16-P27 (avg ~184) remains active but exhibits significant downside variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $515.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 29. Lead time is reliably 0 (same-period arrival). Inspecting the high-demand regime established since Period 16 reveals continued volatility. The 'surge' period (P16-P25) had a mean ~190. However, the last two periods (P27=122, P28=147) show a noticeable dip below that 190 average, though still above the pre-surge historical mean of ~100. This suggests the regime might be softening or entering a wider variance phase. The 5-period average (P24-P28) is ~168 units. Given the high cost of lost sales vs holding (4:1 profit ratio), and the risk of demand snapping back to ~200+, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the full scope of this high-demand regime (starting mostly from P19/P20) without overreacting to the last two lower points or the extreme initial outliers. N=10 covers P19-P28, averaging ~168 with high variance. This effectively bridges the gap between the stabilization at ~185 and the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime softening: Recent demand (P27=122, P28=147) is dipping below the stabilized ~185 level observed in P21-P26. The 5-period average has dropped to ~168, indicating the regime is active but volatile with downside risk.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (219) and Period 30 (205) confirmed that the demand dip in Periods 27-28 was a volatility swing, not a regime softening. This resurgence caused consecutive stockouts (0 ending inventory in P29 and P30). To recover service levels and cover the extreme volatility (range 116-273), we return to parameterizing based on the full high-demand regime starting from Period 16 (N=15). This captures the high mean (~185) and the significant variance required for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime volatility confirmed: The dip in P27-P28 was transient; P29-30 (avg 212) caused stockouts, proving the regime (P16-P30 avg ~185) remains active with high variance risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $876.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a critical stockout crisis, having stocked out for 3 consecutive periods (P29-P31) due to underestimating the rebound after the P27-P28 dip. Current demand (P29-P31 avg ~217) has returned to the upper bound of the High Demand Regime established in P16. The 5-period average (~184) is dragged down by the transient dip and is causing under-ordering. To correct this and satisfy the recurring ~200+ demand, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the immediate surge. For volatility, I continue to use the full high-regime history (N=16, since P16) to ensure safety stock accounts for the extreme range [116, 273] characteristic of this period.

Carry-over insight: Stockout crisis (P29-P31): Demand surged to ~217 avg (P29-P31) immediately following P27-P28 dip, causing consecutive zero-inventory periods. High-demand volatile regime (started P16) remains dominant, characterized by rapid shifts between sub-levels (120s vs 220s).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime volatility confirmed: P29-P31 stockout crisis (avg demand 217) was followed by P32 stabilization (177). The regime (active since P16) is defined by a mean ~185 but with violent bi-modal swings between ~120 and ~220+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $580.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 context: The high-demand, high-volatility regime (active since Period 16) continues. We observed a sharp demand surge in Periods 29-31 (avg 217), which caused multiple stockouts, followed by a moderation in Periods 32-33 (avg 169). With on-hand inventory at 60, we face a critical risk of stockout if demand spikes again. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma. This window (P29-P33) captures the recent surge and the subsequent cooling [160, 227], resulting in a responsive mean (~198) and standard deviation (~29). This sets a base stock target (~222) sufficient to cover approximately 80% of the recent demand distribution (matching the profit/holding ratio), prioritizing service level after recurrent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Volatility continues within high-demand regime. The extreme surge of P29-P31 (avg 217) has moderated in P32-P33 (avg 169). The 5-period moving average (198) remains elevated, driven by the recent peaks, requiring sustained high safety stock buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $873.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35. Ending inventory is critically low (3 units) after a demand spike to 219 in P34. This confirms the high-volatility regime (active since P16) is still generating peaks >200. To prevent stockouts, which happened in P29-P31, we shift mu_hat to a tighter recent window (N=6, avg ~201) to reflect the immediate elevated demand, while using a wider window (N=19) for sigma_hat to capture the full volatility of the regime since the shift. Lead time is reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime volatility confirmed: After a brief moderation in P32-P33 (avg ~168), demand spiked back to 219 in P34, nearly causing a stockout. The regime remains characterized by violent swings between ~160 and ~220+, requiring inventory coverage for the upper bound.

Daily Reward (R_t): $871.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 demand (221) confirms the persistence of the upper demand mode (~220) seen in P34 (219) and P31 (227). The bimodal pattern (oscillating between ~160 and ~220) favors a conservative strategy given the 4:1 critical ratio. The last 7 periods (P29-P35) form a coherent high-stress cluster (avg ~204), excluding the deceptive dip in P27-P28. Inventory is critically low (13 units), so using N=7 for mean and volatility ensures the base stock covers these recurrent peaks.

Carry-over insight: Upper-bound demand persistence confirmed: P34-P35 (avg 220) reinforces that the regime's 'high mode' is the dominant risk factor, despite occasional dips to ~160. 7-period average is stabilized at ~204.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 Context: Lead time remains reliably 0 periods. The high-demand regime, which began in Period 16, continues to dominate. Recent demand (P34-P36) has been robust and consistent: 219, 221, 212 (avg ~217). The momentary dip in P32-P33 (177, 160) appears to be the lower bound of this volatility, significantly higher than historical lows. The last three periods show a return to the upper end of the regime (~220). Given the critical service level needed to prevent stockouts (seen in P29-P31) and the tight inventory position (start with 14), we must target the upper percentile of this recent distribution. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 (covering P27-P36) to capture both the severe dip (122) and the high peaks (227), but primarily relying on the recent stabilization around 220. The 10-period lookback (avg ~191, high variance) is slightly conservative but robust; however, given the immediate trend of ~217 over the last 3 periods, a tighter focus might risk understocking if a surge occurs. Actually, looking at P16-P36, calculating 'recent_N' with N=5 captures the most relevant active sub-regime (P32-P36 avg = 198), but P34-P36 avg is 217. To be safe given recent stockouts, I will use a shorter window N=5 for mean to catch the recent 217 trend, and N=10 for sigma to account for the wider risk profile.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime persistence: P34-P36 demand (219, 221, 212) clusters tightly around ~217, confirming the system has returned to the high-volume mode after the P32-P33 dip. The structural floor appears to be ~160, with a ceiling near 230.

Daily Reward (R_t): $661.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Period 38. We are in a sustained high-demand regime (active since Period 16) characterized by oscillation between a lower band (~160-180) and an upper band (~220+). Period 37 demand (182) moderated from the recent highs of P34-P36 (~217 avg), fitting this oscillating pattern. 

Inventory Status: On-hand is 67 units with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Decision Logic: With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (4+1)), we must prioritize service level while managing the inherent volatility. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mean and volatility. This window (Periods 32-37) captures the full recent cycle of 'dip-peak-moderation' (values: 177, 160, 219, 221, 212, 182), yielding a mean of ~195 and covering the variance without over-biasing towards the peak or the trough. This targets a stock level sufficient to cover the upper-mode demands (~220) while avoiding excessive holding costs during dips.

Carry-over insight: High-demand oscillation continues: Period 37 demand (182) confirms the regime's pattern of swinging between ~160 and ~220, rather than maintaining a constant peak. The 6-period average stabilizes at ~195, identifying the effective center of this volatile band.

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 39. Lead time remains reliably 0. The high-demand regime continues with significant volatility but a recent upward consolidation. Demand in Period 38 (203) rebounded from Period 37 (182), reinforcing the pattern where demand clusters above 200 (P34-P36 avg ~217) with occasional dips. The 5-period average (P34-P38) is ~207 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period block which included the dip to 160. With starting inventory critically low at 14 units and stockout costs high ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the priority is robustness against the upper demand bound. I am setting parameters using N=5 to exclude the lower-demand periods (P32-P33) and focus on the current active cluster (~200-220 units) to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime consolidation: P34-P38 average demand is ~207, shifting up from the broader ~185 baseline. The regime appears to have a firm floor around 180 and a frequent ceiling >215, necessitating tighter recent sampling (N=5) to track the upper mode.

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: Demand regime remains high and volatile. Period 39 demand hit 228 (highest in recent cluster), causing a stockout despite high inventory. The last 6 periods show a dominant 'high mode' with 5 periods > 200 units (avg ~210), interrupted only by P37 (182). Using N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this elevated mean (~209) and the associated volatility, prioritizing service level given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime defined by upper-bound dominance: 5 of last 6 periods exceeded 200 units (Avg ~210), with P39 hitting 228. Occasional dips (e.g., P37=182) are becoming less frequent compared to the sustained high volume, necessitating inventory coverage for the ~220 level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $750.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 Context: The high-demand regime (active since Period 16) continues with characteristic volatility. Demand in Period 40 (195) retracted from the Period 39 peak (228), maintaining an oscillation pattern roughly bounded by [180, 230]. The 7-period average (Period 34-40) is ~209 units. Given the high cost of lost sales (critical ratio 0.8) and the recent stockout in P39, I am using N=7 for mean and volatility estimates. This window captures both the recent peaks (219, 221, 228) and the dips (182, 195), ensuring the base stock level covers the upper tail of demand variance while reflecting the robust sustained average.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime volatility persists: P40 (195) dipped from P39 peak (228), confirming the pattern of oscillation between ~180 and ~230. 7-period average remains robust at ~209.

Daily Reward (R_t): $892.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 demand spiked to 260, causing a stockout. This confirms the high-demand regime (active since P16) still possesses extreme tail risk (ranges 180-260). Avg demand last 5 periods (P37-P41) is ~214. Given high lost-sales penalty, we maintain recent_N = 5 for both mean and sigma to capture this latest spike and the ongoing volatility.

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility confirmed: Period 41 demand (260) re-tested the historical high (P16=273), proving the regime's upper range remains dangerous. The system oscillates violently between ~180 and ~260, causing frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $650.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 observes a sharp demand dip to 178 in Period 42, following the extreme spike of 260 in Period 41. This oscillation confirms the regime is bi-modal, swinging between a floor of ~180 and a ceiling of ~260. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) and the demonstrated risk of stockouts (P41, P39), we must maintain inventory coverage for the upper demand mode despite the recent dip. We use recent_N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture the full range of this volatility (including the 260 outlier) in the base stock calculation, ensuring responsiveness to the rapid swings.

Carry-over insight: Bi-modal volatility confirmed: Period 42 demand (178) dropped sharply from Period 41 (260), establishing a sustained pattern of violent oscillation between a ~180 floor and a ~260 ceiling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $850.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 44. The high-demand regime persists with significant volatility. Demand in Period 43 (218) rebounded near the regime average (~215) after the P42 dip (178), reconfirming that the low values are transient fluctuations rather than a new low trend. The last 5 periods (P39-P43) show an average demand of ~216 units with extreme variance (Range: 178 to 260). Given the lead time is reliably 0 periods, the strategy focuses on immediate coverage. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the full extent of the recent instability (including the P41 spike to 260) and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high risk of stockouts observed in P39 and P41.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime reliability: P43 (218) confirms the effective mean remains ~215 despite violent oscillations (178-260). The system consistently reverts to this ~215-220 baseline after deviations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 context: The high-demand, high-volatility regime (active since P16) continues to oscillate violently between a floor of ~170 and a ceiling of ~260. Period 44 demand (170) represents the lower bound of this band, following a recent peak of 260 in P41. Strategy: With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), stockouts are costly. We must protect against the regime's upper mode. Selecting recent_N=6 captures the last full oscillation cycle (including the P41 spike to 260 and P39 high of 228), resulting in a forecast mean ~208 and high standard deviation. This sets a safety stock buffer capable of absorbing the next potential upswing, rather than reacting too aggressively to the P44 dip. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: High-demand volatility persists. P44 demand (170) dipped to the lower bound of the current oscillation band [170, 260]. The 6-period average stabilizes around ~208, confirming the regime's high volume nature despite the bi-modal swings.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 demand (226 units) bounced back sharply from the Period 44 dip (170), confirming the persistent sawtooth volatility of the high-demand regime. The system continues to oscillate between a floor of ~170 and a ceiling of ~260. The 7-period average is stable at ~211 units, effectively centering this volatile band. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the asymmetric risk (profit $4 vs holding $1) and avoid stockouts during upper-bound swings (like Period 41's 260), we use a 7-period window. This captures the full recent oscillation cycle, including the P41 peak, ensuring both the mean and variance estimates reflect the bi-modal reality.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime persistence: P45 rebound (226) confirms the sawtooth pattern (oscillating between ~170 and ~260) is stable. The 7-period moving average holds steady at ~211, suggesting this mean is the reliable center of the volatile band.

Daily Reward (R_t): $907.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand inventory is critically low (9 units). Demand behavior in Period 46 (229) followed the high level of Period 45 (226), breaking the recent strict saw-tooth (high-low) pattern. This suggests the upper demand mode (~225) is more sticky than the lower mode (~170). To ensure adequate safety stock against another potential spike (like P41's 260), I am selecting N=7 for both mean and volatility. This window captures the P41 peak (260) and the recent variance, yielding a robust baseline (Mean ~211, Std Dev ~30) to target a base stock around 235-240.

Carry-over insight: High-demand sustenance confirmed: Demand remained high in P45-P46 (226, 229), breaking the recent alternating oscillation pattern. This suggests the regime leans heavily towards the ~225 upper mode, treating dips to ~170 as transient deviations rather than a structural bi-modal split.

Daily Reward (R_t): $762.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48/50. Demand in Period 47 was 200, consistent with the high-demand regime. The recent pattern (P45-P47: 226, 229, 200) shows a potential tightening of variance around a mean of ~218, holding above the previous 170 floor. However, the broader 7-period window (P41-P47) includes the 260 spike and 170 dip, providing a more robust estimate of the ongoing volatility (Mean ~211, StdDev ~31). Using N=7 ensures we cover the upper-tail risk (stocking out costs 4x holding) without ignoring the bi-modal nature of the dips.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilization: P45-P47 demand (226, 229, 200) clusters more tightly around ~218, dampening the extreme bi-modal swings seen in P41-P44. However, the regime mean remains robustly >200.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: Demand in the high-demand regime has stabilized recently. P47-P48 (200, 203) show a tightening variance compared to the extreme swings seen in P41-P44. The last 3 periods [229, 200, 203] suggest the mean is firmly around ~210 with reduced volatility. Lead times remain consistently 0. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=9 for both predicted mean and volatility to capture the full context of this regime segment (including the P41 outlier of 260) while weighing the recent stabilization. This provides a robust base stock level (approx 232 units) that covers the vast majority of recent outcomes while not over-reacting to the fading 260 peak.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilization confirmed: The extreme bi-modal oscillations (170 vs 260) have dampened. P46-P48 demand [229, 200, 203] clusters tightly around a mean of ~210, suggesting the regime is finding a steadier equilibrium around this level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $932.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. Period 49 resulted in a stockout (demand 237 > on-hand 233), disproving the hypothesis that demand had stabilized strictly around ~200-210. The high-demand regime remains active with an average near 220 and significant right-tail risk (spikes to 237, historical 260). To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (avg ~219) to stay responsive to the elevated volume. For sigma_hat, I am expanding the window to N=10 (approx std dev ~27 vs N=5's ~16) to incorporate the higher volatility observed in periods 40-44 (range 170-260), ensuring the safety stock buffer covers spikes like the one seen in P49. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Stockout (demand 237) contradicts recent stabilization signs. The high-demand regime persists with a mean ~220 but retains critical volatility, requiring buffers for upper-tail spikes >235 (seen in P49 and P41).
