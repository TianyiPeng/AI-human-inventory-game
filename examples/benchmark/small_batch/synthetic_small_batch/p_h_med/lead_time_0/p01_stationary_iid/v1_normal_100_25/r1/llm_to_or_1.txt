Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No prior game history exists, so parameters are initialized based on the provided historical demand samples (Period_1 to Period_5). Calculated mean is ~90 and std dev ~17. Since there is no confirmed seasonality or trend yet, 'default' methods (using stationary statistics of all history) are selected for demand forecast and volatility. Promised lead time is 0 (immediate replenishment), which is used as the default expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders arrive same period). Demand in P1 (108) and P2 (124) shows an upward trend and has caused two consecutive stockouts. The cost of lost sales ($4) significantly outweighs holding costs ($1). To improve service level and catch up with the rising demand trend, we switch mu_hat to an EWMA with gamma=0.8, which places higher weight on the most recent observation (124) compared to a simple average (116). We use recent_N=3 (capped at available history) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4. Current on-hand is 26 units. Historical data shows consistent observed lead time of 0 periods (immediate arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 3 periods (108, 124, 85) averages ~106 units with significant volatility (std dev ~20). Given the immediate delivery (L=0), I am setting parameters based on the most recent 3 data points to capture the current simulation's demand levels, which appear slightly higher than the static pre-game history. Using recent_N=3 for both mu and sigma allows the controller to react to the active volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods (immediate arrival in same period). Demand has shown high volatility (ranging from 79 to 124) with a downward trend in the last two periods, but the high profit margin ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies maintaining a robust safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to include the earlier higher demand periods in the average and variance calculations, ensuring the base stock covers potential demand spikes similar to Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent history P1-P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $383.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival) across all observed history (P1-P5). Demand is accumulating volatility (varying between 79 and 124) with an average of ~99.2 over the last 5 periods. With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (4+1)), avoiding stockouts is the priority. I will use the full 5-period history (recent_N=5) to estimate both mean and variance, allowing the backend to calculate a safety stock level that covers the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival) across all history (P1-P6), so L defaults to promised lead time (0). Demand history (108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98) shows a mean of ~99 and stdev ~15. This is slightly higher than the provided historical samples suggests. To align with actual game dynamics, I am using recent_N=6 for demand parameters, averaging the entire observed game history to stabilize the Service Level (Profit 4/Holding 1 -> 80% SL). Current on-hand is low (17), requiring replenishment to meet the expected daily demand ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. Demand is volatile with a mean of ~102 and highs reaching 124 (Period 2) and 122 (Period 7), causing a stockout in Period 7. The pre-game historical samples average lower (~90) than the actual game history (~102), so I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to focus strictly on the realized game history and exclude the lower pre-game priors. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods (same-period arrival), so 'calculate' will correctly set L=0. Current inventory is 0, so the system will order up to the full base stock immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation is Period 9. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (actual L=0, confirmed P1-P8). Demand has been relatively volatile recently, with stockouts in P7 and P8 despite decent orders. The demand sequence since P1 is 108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122, 121. The most recent two periods (P7, P8) show higher demand (>120), suggesting a potential upward shift or high-variance regime compared to the lull in P3-P4. To capture this recent high activity without overreacting to the full history average (which is dampened by the low periods), we will use a recent_N=3 approach for demand estimation (avg of P6-P8 ~113.6). L stays at default (0) as it is reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand has shown a significant upward shift in the last 3 periods (P7-P9 average ~129 vs P1-P6 average ~99), culminating in a record high of 145 in Period 9. The system has stocked out for 3 consecutive periods (P7, P8, P9) because forecasts lagged behind this growth. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding), we must react aggressively to the trend. I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high demand levels (~129.3) and prevent further lost sales. Sigma uses recent_5 to reflect increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift P7-P9: avg increased from ~99 to ~129 (+30%)

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: On-hand is 31, no in-transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival observed P1-P10). Demand analysis reveals a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 7. While early demand (P1-P6) averaged ~99, recent periods (P7-P10) average ~125.75, with P10 (115) confirming the elevated level despite dropping from the P9 peak (145). To ensure service levels adapt to this higher mean and avoid stockouts seen in P7-P9, we switch mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4, focusing strictly on this new regime. L remains default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 decision. On-hand inventory is 48. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand analysis shows a recent high regime (P7-P9 avg ~129), followed by a moderation in P10 (115) and a significant drop in P11 (89) back to pre-spike levels. While P11 suggests a potential end to the high-demand surge, 'recent_N' with N=5 (P7-P11) is selected to cautiously blend the high spike with recent cooling, resulting in a forecast mean of ~118. This protects against service loss if the drop was noise, without overstocking massively if the regime effectively ended. Volatility (sigma) is also calculated on N=5 to capture the wide swing between 145 and 89.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival), confirming that L should be handled via the default (promised=0) or calculated method; since it's stable, 'default' is safe. The demand regime shift noted in Period 10 (avg ~129) seems to have cooled off slightly in periods 11-12 (89, 102), bringing the average down from the peak but potentially still higher than early history. The last 6 periods of demand are: [122, 121, 145, 115, 89, 102]. Average of this window is ~115.6. This is higher than the early average (~98) but lower than the peak burst. Using 'recent_N=6' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this recent volatility and the higher plateau without overreacting to the single spike at P9 or the dip at P11. With lead time 0, we need coverage for Period 13 demand today. Current on-hand is 34.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Lead time reliably 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand Analysis: The high-demand regime (P7-P9) has clearly subsided; demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) averaged ~95 units, significantly lower than the peak period average (~129). Period 13 demand (73) was the lowest since Period 2, suggesting a potential cooling trend or return to early-game baseline. We switch to a short recent_N window (N=4) for mu and sigma to exclude the P9 outlier (145) and align inventory targets with the current normalized demand levels (~95).

Carry-over insight: Demand normalization confirmed P10-P13: avg demand dropped to ~95 (reverting from P7-P9 peak of ~129).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Period 15. Lead time remains consistently observed at 0 periods (promised default). Demand has shown a continued downward trend since the P7-P9 peak, with P13 (73) and P14 (63) dropping below the recent 'normalization' average of ~95. I will use a short memory (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture this cooling trend (Period 10-14 average is ~88.4) without over-reacting to the single low point in P14. This balances the risk of holding costs against the high profit-margin service requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains 0. Demand spiked unexpectedly in P15 to 142 (after a low of 63 in P14). This suggests high unpredictability rather than a stable low regime. I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to average the high volatility (result ~107), avoiding over-anchoring on the dip in P13-14. I am setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to explicitly capture the high recent deviation (63 to 142) and force a larger safety stock to prevent another stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: New volatility spike detected at P15 (demand 142 vs prev 63); short-term variance has increased drastically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand (108) suggests the Period 15 spike (142) was an outlier or high-variance event rather than a sustained shift to >140, as it reverted closer to the historical average. However, the sequence P13-P16 (73, 63, 142, 108) shows extreme volatility compared to earlier stable periods. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am using recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this recent instability (the dip in P13-14 and the spike in P15) to ensure safety stock covers the heightened variance ($q=0.8$).

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime P13-P16: demand fluctuates wildly (63 to 142), making variance the primary risk factor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 17's demand of 148 fully depleted stock. We are in a high-volatility regime (Period 13-17 range: 63 to 148). While the mean of the last 5 periods is ~107, the standard deviation is extremely high (~39) due to swings between <70 and >140. To balance the risk of stockouts ($4 margin) against holding costs ($1), we use recent_N=5 for both Mu and Sigma. N=5 captures the full extent of the recent volatility (including the dips to 63/73 and spikes to 142/148), resulting in a safety stock that buffers against the erratic peaks without aggressively overstocking for the lows.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime continues through Period 17: demand range expanded to 63-148 (P13-P17), confirming unpredictable oscillations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $405.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: Lead time consistently 0 periods. Demand analysis reveals a distinct regime shift starting Period 15. Periods 13-14 were low (~68 avg), while Periods 15-18 have been consistently high (range 108-148, avg ~127). The demand 'floor' appears to have risen to ~108. With a high critical ratio (0.8), the cost of understocking during these spikes is severe. Therefore, I am switching to N=4 for demand estimators to exclude the P13-P14 low values and target the current higher-volume, volatile cluster. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent mean of ~127 and local volatility, protecting against lost sales in this new elevated regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor elevation confirmed P15-P18: demand consistently >108 (avg ~127), sharply distinct from P13-P14 lows (~68).

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 demand plummeted to 62, sharply contradicting the high-demand trend of Periods 15-18 (which were all >108). This break invalidates the hypothesis of a permanently elevated demand floor and confirms a regime of extreme volatility where demand swings between 62 and 148. Promised lead time of 0 remains reliable (all arrivals immediate). Given the high cost of stockouts (Critical Ratio ~0.8) and the proven potential for demand to hit ~148, we must maintain coverage despite the recent low. We utilize recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the full extent of this volatility (including both the high peaks and the new low) to set a robust safety stock.

Carry-over insight: High volatility expanded: P19 demand (62) broke the recent 108+ floor, confirming an extreme range of 62-148 (P15-P19) rather than a stable high regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $367.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period is 21. Demand in Period 20 normalized to 102, falling centrally within the recent extreme range of 62-148 (P15-P19). The 'High Volatility' regime (starting P15) continues to be the dominant risk factor. A short-term average (N=3) would yield ~91, which risks understocking if demand swings back to the 140s (as seen in P15/P17). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must protect against the upper tail of this volatile distribution. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=6 (P15-P20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full volatile cluster (including peaks of 142/148 and the trough of 62), resulting in a mean ~112 and a high sigma ~30, ensuring the base stock buffers against further oscillations. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Current on-hand inventory is 31. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (immediate arrival). While demand in the last two periods (P20: 102, P21: 107) suggests a return to stability near the sample mean (~105), the recent history (P15-P19) exhibited extreme volatility ranging from 62 to 148. It is premature to declare the high-volatility regime over based on only two data points. Therefore, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility. This window (P17-P21) captures the high spike (148) and the severe dip (62) alongside the recent stable points, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the persisting risk of variance while centering on the recent demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: Current on-hand is 27. Lead time remains consistently 0 (immediate arrival). Demand history shows a recent stabilization in P20-P22 (avg ~105, range 102-107) following a period of extreme volatility in P15-P19 (range 62-148). Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, CR=0.8), it is risky to assume the volatility has permanently ended based on only 3 data points. Therefore, we use a window of N=8 (P15-P22) for demand parameters. This captures the recent stable mean while maintaining a higher standard deviation from the volatile periods to ensure adequate safety stock against potential recurrence of spikes.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization detected P20-P22: Demand variance compressed significantly (range 102-107, avg ~105) compared to P15-P19 volatility. Monitoring for persistence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Lead time remains consistently 0. Demand has stabilized significantly in P20-P23 (avg ~105, range 102-107), marking a distinct departure from the high volatility of P15-P19. To optimize, I am setting mu_hat to focus tightly on this new stable regime (N=4). However, because volatility can return abruptly, I am keeping sigma_hat on a wider window (N=8) which includes previous large swings (e.g., P17's 148 demand) to ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed P20-P23: Demand variance collapsed (range 102-107, avg 105), ending the high-volatility regime of P15-P19.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: The demand stabilization detected in P23 has solidified into a distinct regime (P20-P24). Over the last 5 periods, demand has remained tightly clustered in the [102, 107] range with a mean of ~105 and negligible variance. This contrasts sharply with the high-volatility regime of P15-P19 (range 62-148). Consequently, I am switching parameters to 'recent_N = 5' for both mean and variance. This allows the backend to target the current stable demand level (~105) and significantly reduce safety stock, eliminating unnecessary holding costs associated with the obsolete high-volatility data. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 demand spiked to 125, breaking the P20-P24 stable trend (range 102-107) and causing a stockout. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, CR=0.8), we must increase safety stock to accommodate potential volatility. By extending the lookback window to N=10 (P16-P25), we incorporate the P25 spike and the volatility of P16-P19 alongside the recent lull. This increases sigma_hat significantly (std dev ~21 vs ~8 for the stable period), targeting a base stock level (~125) that matches the most recent demand peak.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: The brief period of demand stabilization (P20-P24) has ended. High volatility returned in P25-P26 with a spike to 125 (causing a stockout) followed by a drop to 80. The mean demand remains consistent around ~105, but the variance has expanded significantly. I am selecting N=10 for both mu and sigma to capture this new volatility alongside the previous volatile regime (P17-P19), as using a shorter window (e.g., N=5) would underestimate the risk of spikes shown in P25. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Volatility return P25-P26: Demand instability (125, 80) has broken the P20-P24 stable streak; variance is increasing again.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Volatility has returned in the last 3 periods (P25-P27 demands: 125, 80, 115), breaking the prior stability of P20-P24. The variance is now the primary risk, causing a stockout in P25. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am switching to a short-term memory (N=3) for both mean and sigma to align with this new erratic cluster and boost safety stock (via higher recent variance) to protect the high service level requirements (CR=0.8).

High volatility has returned (P25-P28 observed: 125, 80, 115, 132). Current on-hand is 0 following a stockout in P28. Moving to recent_N (N=5) for both mu and sigma to capture this localized instability (avg ~111, range 80-132) and improve service level coverage against spikes.

Carry-over insight: Volatility confirmed P25-P28: Demand oscillates widely (80-132) with avg ~113, causing repeated stockouts; stabilization period P20-P24 has ended.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 analysis: Demand continues to exhibit significant volatility (P25-P29 range 80-132, avg ~110), confirming the end of the stable regime seen in P20-P24. With a profit margin of 80% (q=0.8), we must defend against stockouts during spikes (like P28's 132) while acknowledging the high variance (std dev ~21 over last 5 periods). Lead time remains consistently 0. I am switching parameters to recent_N=5 (covering the volatile block P25-P29) to ensure the safety stock buffer reflects the current instability rather than the older stable data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Actual lead time consistently confirmed as 0 periods (immediate arrival). The current demand regime (starting P25) remains volatile with a range of 80-132 and an average of ~106, though P29-P30 showed a slight moderation (98, 87). I am using recent_N=6 for demand and volatility parameters to specifically target this active volatile cluster (P25-P30) and exclude the prior stable data. This ensures the safety stock (driven by sigma_hat) accounts for the recent 132-unit peak risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 experienced a severe stockout due to a demand spike of 145, the highest since Period 17. The low-volatility period (P20-P24) is definitively over, replaced by a high-volatility regime beginning in Period 25. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has ranged from 80 to 145 with an average of ~112. To address this instability and the recent stockout (Current On-hand: 0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=7. This window captures the full extent of the current volatile cluster, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the high variance (std dev ~22) and the risk of 140+ spikes. Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Usage of recent_N=7 for mu/sigma is now locked to the high-volatility regime P25-P31 (Avg ~112, Range 80-145); Period 31's spike to 145 confirms the tail risk is back.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 context: We are deep in a high-volatility regime (P25-P32). The demand during this period has oscillated widely (range 80-145), causing repeated stockouts at P25, P28, and P31. The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 111.6, but the variance is severe. Specifically, the peaks (125, 132, 145) consistently exceed standard safety stock buffers, suggesting a need for a reactive volatility measure. The most recent demand (P32) was 111, stabilizing slightly near the mean, but the spike in P31 (145) reminds us that tail risk is high. Given the continued 0-period lead time performance (perfect reliability), the risk is purely demand-side. I will maintain the strategy of using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full extent of this volatile block (P25-P32) for both mean and standard deviation. This window includes the low of 80 and the high of 145, ensuring the safety stock calculation (sigma) reflects the true instability.

Although P32-P33 showed moderate demand (111, 105), the recent spike to 145 in P31 requires maintaining significant safety stock. I am setting N=9 for both mu and sigma to capture the full statistics of this specific volatile cluster (P25-P33), ensuring the backend prepares for potential swings back to 130+.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 Analysis: We are currently in a sustained high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. The last 10 periods (P25-P34) show erratic demand ranging from 80 to 145, with repeated stockouts (P25, P28, P31) despite average demand hovering around 110. The most recent demand samples are: 87, 145, 111, 105, 98. While there has been slight moderation in the last 3 periods, the spike to 145 in Period 31 warns of significant tail risk. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high variance (std dev ~22 over the last 10 periods vs ~15 in stable times), we must maintain a robust safety stock. I will continue using a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) for both mu and sigma to capture the full extent of this volatility cluster (P25 onwards) without over-weighting very old stable data. This balances the risk of stockouts (costly at $4 profit loss) against holding costs ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 Context: On-hand is 20, in-transit is 0. Demand history in most recent periods (P32-P35) has been remarkably stable: 111, 105, 98, 107. The average over this short stabilization window is ~105. This marks a departure from the extreme volatility seen in P25-P31. While the volatility spike of P31 (145) is still recent enough to warrant caution, the last 4 periods suggest a return to a calmer regime. I will shift from the highly responsive recent_N=7 to a slightly steadier recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization while respecting the recent mean of ~105, rather than the higher volatility average of ~112. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization detected P32-P35: Demand has tightened to a narrow range (98-111, avg ~105) following the high-volatility regime of P25-P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $486.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 decision phase. Current on-hand is low (6 units) after Period 36 demand of 123. The stabilization detected in Period 36 (P32-P35) showed a tight range of ~98-111, but Period 36 demand broke out slightly to 123, hinting at potential rising volatility or just a minor variance. The previous high-volatility regime (P25-P31) had spikes up to 145. 

Given the low inventory position (6), the cost of stockout is high. Demand in the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is: 111, 105, 98, 107, 123. Average ~109.

Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage risk, we will use a recent_N window that captures the current stable-but-rising trend. A window of N=7 captures the tail end of the high volatility and the recent stabilization, providing a balanced safety stock. Purely recent (N=5) average is 108.8, std dev is ~9.3. 

We will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to incorporate the P31 spike (145) into the safety stock calculation, guarding against the slight breakout observed in P36 without overreacting.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Slight demand breakout in P36 (123) vs stable range P32-P35 (98-111); watching if volatility returns.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 38. The short stabilization (P32-P35) has been disrupted by renewed volatility in P36-P37 (demand swinging from 123 down to 83). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (CR=0.8), avoiding stockouts is the priority. I am setting mu_hat with recent_N=6 (avg ~104.5) to reflect the immediate central tendency, while extending sigma_hat to recent_N=10. This wider window for volatility captures significant recent spikes (145 in P31, 132 in P28) and the recent low (83 in P37), ensuring the safety stock calculation accounts for the full range of recent instability to protect against lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Volatility returned P36-P37: Range widened to 83-123 (breaking previous stable P32-P35 range of 98-111); demand instability has resumed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $429.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand (110) falls within the volatile range 83-123 established in P36-P37, confirming the end of the short stable period (P32-P35). With on-hand inventory low at 11 units and a history of significant spikes (e.g., P31 at 145, P36 at 123), the primary risk is understocking during a high-variance upswing. Lead time remains reliably 0. I am selecting recent_N=9 for both demand and volatility parameters. This window (P30-P38) captures the most recent major spike (145 in P31) alongside the current volatility, ensuring the safety stock calculation reflects the tail risk of demand exceeding 120+ units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Date: Period_40). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand in P39 was 93. Following the extreme spike in P31 (145), the demand initially stabilized (P32-P35) but has since entered a moderately choppy regime from P36-P39 with a range of 83-123 and an average of ~102. I am selecting recent_N=8 (P32-P39) for both mean and volatility to capture the full characteristics of this post-spike period, balancing the brief stable window with the recent fluctuations. Current on-hand is 31, and with L=0, the system responds immediately.

Carry-over insight: Moderate volatility persists P36-P39: Range 83-123, Avg ~102. The tight stability of P32-P35 (Range 98-111) has not returned.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: Demand in P40 was 91, following 93 in P39, showing a short-term cooling trend. However, historical patterns (e.g., P29-P30 cooling followed by P31 spike to 145) suggest that low-demand periods often precede sharp rebounds. To protect against this recognized tail risk while maintaining high service (CR=0.8), I am using a 10-period window (P31-P40) for parameter estimation. This explicitly includes the P31 outlier (145), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover potential volatility spikes rather than overfitting to the recent lull.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 demand dropped significantly to 64 units, the lowest observation since Period 19. This sharp decline expands the volatility range (now 64-123 over the last 7 periods) and suggests high instability rather than a simple downward trend. Historical patterns (Period 14->15, Period 19->20) show that such lows are often followed by sharp rebounds to >100. Consequently, while the moving average drops, we must maintain sufficient safety stock for a potential bounce-back. We utilize recent_N=7 for both mu and sigma to capture this full volatility window (Period 35-41), incorporating both the recent low (64) and the Period 36 high (123).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Volatility expanded downward P40-P41: Demand dropped to 64 (lowest since P19), widening the recent range to 64-123 and dragging the recent average down to ~96.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 43. Reviewing P42 conclude: Demand remained low at 65 (similar to P41's 64). This creates a 2-period cluster of low demand (avg ~64.5), significantly below the P36-P40 average of ~102. Despite this drop, the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) dictates we should not over-rotate on just two data points, as a reversion to mean (~100) is costly to miss. Observed lead time remains 0. I will switch to recent_N=5 for both mu and sigma. This window includes the high point of Period 38 (110) and the recent lows, producing a balanced forecast (Avg ~85, Std ~20) that lowers inventory exposure without completely stripping safety stock in case of a demand rebound.

Carry-over insight: Demand drop P41-P42: Consecutive lows (64, 65) mark a significant deviation from the previous ~102 average (P36-P40), suggesting a potential new low-demand regime or extreme downward volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Detected a confirmed demand shelf-drop. Periods 41, 42, and 43 show consistently low demand (64, 65, 62; avg ~64) compared to the prior P36-P40 average of ~102. This 3-period persistence signals a regime change. I am switching 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to 'recent_N=3' to rapidly adapt inventory targets down to this new level (~64) and avoid accumulating excess stock. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed P41-P43: Avg demand dropped to ~64 (range 62-65), significantly below the P36-P40 average of ~102.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 experienced a stockout (Demand 68 vs Sold 65) due to overly tight inventory in the new low-demand regime. While demand has shifted significantly lower (Avg ~65 for P41-P44) compared to the prior ~100 baseline, the history (P15, P20) warns of potential sharp rebounds from low points. To prevent further stockouts while respecting the drop, we use N=5. This window includes P40 (Demand 91), which moderately lifts the mean forecast (~70) and inflates volatility estimates, buffering against slight upward corrections or variance without reverting to the obsolete high-volume parameters.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime confirmed and stabilized P41-P44: Avg ~65 (Range 62-68). This 4-period duration exceeds previous short-lived dips (P14, P19), indicating a durable structural shift rather than transient volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 demand spiked to 116, shattering the low-demand regime (avg ~65) of P41-P44. This caused a stockout. We cannot rely on the short-term low average anymore. Switching to a longer horizon (N=10, covering P36-P45) to incorporate both the recent dip and the surrounding high-volatility periods (123, 110, 116). This yields a moderate average (~88) but a very high standard deviation, which will increase the safety stock (cap) to protect against another spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift reversal P45: Demand spiked to 116 after a stable low period (P41-P44, avg ~65), signaling the end of the suppression regime and a likely return to volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: The low-demand 'suppression' regime (P41-P44, avg ~65) was sharply broken in P45 (116), followed by a moderate P46 (81). The average of the last two periods (98.5) and the 116 spike suggest a return to historical norms (~100-110) rather than the recent lows. Given high stockout costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we prioritize service level. We use 'explicit' mu_hat=105 to bridge the forecast back to normal levels, bypassing the lag of the recent dip. We use 'recent_N=5' for sigma to capture the high volatility (range 62-116) across the transition.

Carry-over insight: Volatility confirmed P45-P46: Demand is oscillating (116 then 81) following the P41-P44 low regime; variance is currently the dominant risk factor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 demand (127) resulted in a stockout, confirming that the low-demand dip (P41-P44, Avg ~65) has fully ended and high volatility has returned (P45-P47 Avg ~108, Range 81-127). Including the dip data in the forecast drags down the mean and causes underordering (as seen in P47). Therefore, we switch to a short memory (N=3) to focus exclusively on the post-recovery regime (P45, P46, P47) which better reflects the current high demand and volatility risk.

Carry-over insight: High demand volatility confirmed P45-P47: Avg ~108, Range 81-127. The earlier low-demand dip (P41-P44) is fully reversed.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. Nearing end of horizon. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been highly volatile recently. Following the low-demand dip in P41-P44 (avg ~65), demand has surged back to a high-volatility regime in P45-P48 (Avg ~102, Range 81-127). Specifically, recent demands were 116, 81, 127, 83. This oscillation (high-low-high-low) suggests extreme unpredictability. Given the short horizon remaining (2 periods), avoiding stockouts is crucial to capture remaining profit, but overstocking is risky. The 0-period lead time means we can react instantly. Due to the high volatility (std dev of last 4 is ~22), I will stick to a reactive recent_N approach to capture the current fluctuation without over-weighting the older low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: High volatility persists P45-P48: Demand is oscillating wildly (116, 81, 127, 83) with avg ~102, confirming the end of the P41-P44 low regime.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. Inventory stocked out in Period 49 due to a demand spike of 135. The current regime (P45-P49) is characterized by extreme volatility with an alternating High-Low pattern (values: 116, 81, 127, 83, 135). The average over this 5-period window is ~108.4, but the variance is severe (range 81-135). The previous low-demand regime (P41-P44) is now irrelevant. To minimize stockout costs (CR=0.8), I am setting mu and sigma based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the full extent of this volatility without being diluted by the older low-demand data. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime P45-P49: Demand oscillates with an alternating High-Low-High pattern (116, 81, 127, 83, 135), avg ~108. The P49 peak of 135 confirms the upper bound of this volatile range is expanding.
