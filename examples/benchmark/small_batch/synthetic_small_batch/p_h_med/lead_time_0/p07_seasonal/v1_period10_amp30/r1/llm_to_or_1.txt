Daily Reward (R_t): $431.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 actual demand (114) was ~1.5x the historical sample for Period 1 (76). Historical data indicates a sharp demand increase from Period 1 to Period 2 (76 -> 130). Applying the observed 1.5x scaling factor to the historical Period 2 value yields a forecast of ~195. Using explicit mu_hat to capture this expected seasonal spike. Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand vs History Scaling: Period 1 actual (114) exceeded historical sample (76) by 50%. Future forecasts should apply this scaling factor to the provided historical profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 demand (114) remained identical to Period 1, contradicting the historical pattern which predicted a sharp rise from P1 (76) to P2 (130). This invalidates the previous 'scaling factor' hypothesis. Demand currently appears flat and decoupled from the historical seasonal shape. For Period 3, I will switch mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=2) to follow the observed flat trend (avg 114). I will retain 'default' for sigma_hat to utilize the historical variance as a safety buffer, since recent variance is zero. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Scaling hypothesis failed: P2 demand (114) remained flat vs P1 (114) despite expected historical jump (130 vs 76). Demand appears decoupled from historical seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual demand in P1-P3 (114, 114, 86) shows no correlation with the provided historical curve (76, 130, 159), which peaked in P3 just as actuals dropped. Given this decoupling, I am discarding the historical samples entirely and switching to a reactive forecast based on the last 3 observed periods. Lead time remains stable at 0. With a high critical ratio (0.8), using the 3-period average (~105) buffers against a potential rebound to P1/P2 levels, whereas basing solely on P3 (86) risks costly stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand inversion confirmed: P3 actual (86) dropped while historical sample peaked (159). Actuals (114, 114, 86) are uncorrelated with historical seasonality; forecasting must rely solely on recent observed actuals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $471.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: Inventory is critically low (1 unit). Observed lead time matches promised (0 periods). Demand analysis confirms decoupling from historical samples (P4 actual 118 vs historical 101, P3 actual 86 vs historical 159). We proceed with a forecast based entirely on recent observed actuals (Mean of P1-P4 is 108). Given the high profit-to-holding ratio (4:1) and observed volatility (range 86-118), we use explicit inputs derived from actuals: mu=108 and a slightly inflated sigma=25 to ensure adequate safety stock coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Actual demand in Period 5 (121) confirms a stabilized high-demand regime, sharply contrasting with the historical data which predicted a drop to 78. The dip in Period 3 (86) increasingly appears to be an outlier, with subsequent periods (118, 121) returning to the ~120 level. Lead time consistency allows strictly default setting. I am setting an explicit mean of 120 (average of recent 'recovery' periods 4-5) to avoid dragging down the forecast with the P3 outlier, but setting a conservative explicit sigma of 15 (derived from the full 5-period variance including the outlier) to maintain a safety buffer given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Actuals settled in 118-121 range (Periods 4-5) following P3 volatility, significantly exceeding historical expectation of 78.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 demand (75) dropped significantly from the Period 4-5 levels (~120), invalidating the previous plateau theory. The demand history (114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75) strongly suggests a recurring 3-period cycle (High-High-Low). Under this pattern, Period 7 corresponds to the start of a new cycle (High), likely in the 115-120 range. Lead time remains reliably 0. I strictly maintain lead time at default. Given the high volatility and cyclicality, I switch to using the full observed history (N=6) for both mean and sigma. This sets a mean ~105 but includes high variance, raising the safety stock to cover the expected 'High' demand of ~120 while accounting for the pattern's oscillation.

Carry-over insight: Cyclical demand pattern detected: Observed sequence (114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75) suggests a recurring 3-period cycle (High-High-Low). Period 7 begins a new cycle and is expected to be High (~115-120).

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 demand (74) invalidated the 'High-High-Low' cycle hypothesis by extending the low-demand trend (P6: 75, P7: 74). The recent history (last 4 periods: 118, 121, 75, 74) reveals a bimodal distribution with equal probability of High (~120) or Low (~75) demand. Given the high critical fractile (0.8, due to 4:1 Profit:Holding ratio), it is optimal to buffer against the High demand scenario. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 sets the base stock roughly at 119 (Mean 97 + Z*Sigma ~22), which covers the High demand case effectively while acknowledging the lower average.

Carry-over insight: Period 7 Cycle Break: The expected H-H-L pattern failed when P7 (74) followed P6 (75), creating a consecutive low trend. Demand appears bimodal (High ~120, Low ~75) with structural instability rather than a clean 3-period cycle.

Daily Profit: $476.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0. Period 8 demand (119) confirmed a return to the High demand regime (~120) after a two-period Low trough (~75). Historically, High regimes persist for 2 consecutive periods (P1-P2, P4-P5), suggesting Period 9 is likely to remain High. With a critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), understocking is 4x as costly as overstocking. Therefore, we use an emphatic explicit forecast of 120 to capture the expected High demand, while relying on the broad historical volatility (N=8) to size safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal demand confirmed: P8 (119) signals re-entry to High regime (~120) after P6-P7 Lows (~75). High regimes historically persist for ~2 periods, forecasting P9 as High.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 demand (102) was significantly lower than the previous High (119), creating ambiguity about whether the High regime is softening or if this is natural variance. While the historical pattern of '2 High periods followed by Low' (P1-P2, P4-P5, P8-P9) suggests Period 10 might revert to a Low regime (~75), the cost of a stockout ($4 margin) is 4x the cost of holding inventory ($1). Over-forecasting for a Low period costs ~$40 in holding, while under-forecasting a High period costs ~$160 in lost profit. Therefore, I must defend the High demand scenario. I set mu_hat to 115 (approximating the High regime average of ~114-118) and maintain a modest sigma to cover the upper bound observed (121).

Carry-over insight: High regime volatility increased: Period 9 demand (102) fell below the typical High range (118-121), expanding the observed High regime band to 102-121. The 2-period High block pattern persists (P1-P2, P4-P5, P8-P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 demand (140) set a new record high, causing a stockout of 16 units. This shifts the 'High' regime ceiling from ~120 to 140 and increases volatility (recent Highs: 119, 102, 140). The current High block has lasted 3 periods (P8-P10), breaking the prior 2-period pattern. Given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the penalty for underestimating another High period (opportunity cost ~$260) far outweighs the cost of holding inventory if the regime flips to Low (~$65). Therefore, parameters are set explicitly to target a base stock of ~142 units (covering the P10 max), utilizing a mean of 125 and sigma of 20 to reflect the intensified volatility.

Carry-over insight: High regime volatility verified: Range expanded to 102-140 (P10 new max). Duration of current High block (3 periods) exceeds historical max (2 periods), suggesting extended regime stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 demand (78) confirmed a drop back to the 'Low' regime (avg ~76) after a 3-period 'High' block. History (P3, P6-P7) suggests these Low phases last 1-2 periods before a sharp rebound to the High (~120) regime. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit-to-holding ratio), forecasting strictly for the Low regime carries excessive stockout risk if a rebound occurs immediately. Therefore, we use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand estimation, which captures the bimodal mix of recent Lows (P7, P11) and Highs (P8, P9, P10). This yields a robust target (~103 mean + safety stock) that covers a potential High rebound while acknowledging the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Low regime re-entry confirmed at Period 11 (78). Pattern suggests Low phases last 1-2 periods before rebounding to High (>115). Volatility remains elevated due to P10 outlier (140).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 demand (158) set a new record high, confirming a trend of increasing volatility and higher peaks (121->140->158). The pattern indicates we are currently in a High regime following the P11 Low. Historical High regimes persist for 2-3 periods. To manage recent extreme variance (78 to 158), I am using a 5-period rolling window for both mean and volatility. This captures the recent expansion in range while smoothing the single-period outlier effect.

Carry-over insight: Peak demand ceiling is rising progressively: Period 5 (121) -> Period 10 (140) -> Period 12 (158). Volatility estimates must account for expanding upper range.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (150 units) confirms the validity of the 'Ultra-High' demand regime established in Period 12 (158 units). The demand ceiling has progressively risen (102->140->158), and we are potentially in a sustained high-demand block (similar to the 3-period high block of P8-P10). Given the high cost of lost sales ($4 margin) versus holding costs ($1), it is optimal to forecast for the continued High regime rather than anticipating a cyclical drop. A drop to ~80 would incur ~$75 excess holding cost, whereas missing a demand of ~150 would cost ~$300 in lost profit. Therefore, we use a tight recent average (N=2) for mu to capture the new high level (approx 154) and a broader window (N=5) for sigma to account for the extreme regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ultra-High demand regime sustained: P13 (150) reinforces P12 (158), establishing a new forecast baseline ~154. High cost of stockouts ($4) vs holding ($1) mandates targeting this upper bound despite volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 15. The aggressive rising trend of peaks (140->158->150) broke in Period 14 with a demand of 124, returning to the established 'High' regime band (115-125). Despite the drop, demand remains significantly above the historical average. Strategy: Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), we must continue to defend against the recent 'Ultra-High' peaks even if P14 signaled a cooling. I am using a short-term average (N=3) for the mean to stay responsive to the elevated levels (avg ~144) and a longer window (N=5) for volatility to capture the full range of recent swings (from P11's 78 to P12's 158). This ensures sufficient safety stock to cover the 0.8 service level target.

Carry-over insight: Peak reversal detected: Period 14 (124) halted the rising peak trend (P12 158 -> P13 150), signaling a potential return to the standard 'High' regime band (115-125) rather than a sustained shift to a 150+ baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 demand (99) confirms a steep cooling trend (158->150->124->99) following the 'Ultra-High' anomaly in Periods 12-13. However, given the high stockout cost ($4 vs $1 holding) and the fact that 99 is still significantly above the 'Low' regime (~75), we must avoid under-forecasting if demand stabilizes near 100-120. I selected mu_hat 'recent_N=3' (approx 124) to capture the descent while maintaining coverage for the 'High' regime. I kept sigma_hat window wider (N=5) to account for the extreme range (78-158) observed recently, ensuring safety stock buffers against lingering volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cooling trend confirmed: Demand dropped 150 -> 124 -> 99, exiting 'Ultra-High' regime. Current level (99) sits between historical High (~120) and Low (~75) bands, suggesting a transition or dampening of volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand dropped to a historical low of 58, confirming a stiff cooling trend after the P12-14 peaks. We are now in a 'Low' regime. However, historical patterns show Lows last only 1-2 periods before rebounding. Using recent_N=3 for mu/sigma (avg ~94) balances the downward momentum against the risk of a rebound, heavily weighted by the high cost of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor detected: Period 16 demand (58) sets new historical minimum, confirming the end of the 'Ultra-High' regime (P12-14). Pattern now resembles earlier 'Low' volatility (range 58-78), which historically precedes sharp rebounds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 actual demand (103) confirms a rebound from the historical low in Period 16 (58), effectively ending the short-term cooling trend. This mirrors previous cyclical patterns where low-demand regimes (58-75) are brief (1-2 periods) and snap back to a 'Standard High' band (100-125). Given the recent extreme volatility (ranging from 58 to 158 over the last 6 periods), we employ a 10-period lookback. This window captures the full spectrum of recent behaviors\u2014including the Ultra-High peaks and the recent floor\u2014resulting in a mean (~113) and deviation that appropriately sizes safety stock for the high service-level requirement (Critical Ratio 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Rebound confirmed: P17 (103) validates the expectation that Low regimes (P16: 58) are transient. Demand has re-entered the moderate-high band (100-125), stabilizing after the P12-14 surge and P16 crash.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 demand (46) set a new historical low, contradicting the stabilization signal from Period 17 and confirming a high-volatility downward trend (declining peaks: 150->124->103, deepening valleys: 58->46). Despite the drop, the high cost of stockouts ($4) vs. holding ($1) necessitates a buffer against potential oscillations (like P17's 103). N=5 is chosen to balance the recent lows with the preceding moderate demand, setting a target base stock ~114 to cover typical rebound scenarios while adjusting for the bearish major trend.

Carry-over insight: Bearish volatility confirmed: P18 (46) set new low, erasing P17 recovery signal. Pattern shows declining peaks (150->124->103) and deepening lows (58->46), with high oscillating variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $391.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 demand (101) rebounded sharply from Period 18 (46), confirming a pattern of high-frequency oscillation rather than a sustained crash. Current on-hand is critical (13). To handle this volatility (~50 to ~100 swings) and protect the 80% service level, we use recent_N=6 for both mean and volatility. This window (Mean ~88) averages the recent extremes (high ~124, low ~46) better than a shorter window which might toggle too aggressively.

Carry-over insight: Oscillation confirmed: Demand swings are rapid (P17:103 -> P18:46 -> P19:101). The 'deepening low' trend was immediately reversed, suggesting a volatile mean-reverting process around ~85-90 rather than a directional crash.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand is oscillating (High-Low-High-Low) with recent values 103, 46, 101, 69. Following a Low (69), a rebound is likely. Switched to recent_N=6 for mu/sigma to capture the full volatility of this new unstable regime (avg ~80, high variance) and prevent stockouts given the low starting inventory (45).

Carry-over insight: Oscillatory regime stabilized: Demand continues to alternate violently (High-Low-High-Low: 101->69). The mean over the last 6 periods (~80) is lower than the P12-14 peak (~150), confirming a shift to a lower-average, high-variance regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand exhibits a strong 'sawtooth' oscillation (High-Low-High-Low) since Period 16. Period 21 was High (109), suggesting Period 22 will be Low (~70). However, the cost of stockout ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1). A short memory (N=3) captures the recent rising trend in peaks (101->109) and volatility, setting a base stock (~110) that safely covers a potential 'High' realization or pattern break. While this likely incurs a modest holding cost if the 'Low' pattern holds, this 'insurance' is cheap compared to the profit loss of understocking a 'High' period.

Carry-over insight: Sawtooth oscillation identified: Demand strictly alternates High (~105) and Low (~60) since Period 16. Variance remains high, but local peaks are rising slightly (101->109).

LLM Rationale:
High-Low oscillation pattern broken by P22 surge (136) following P21 (109), causing consecutive stockouts. Shift parameters to shorter-term history (N=3) to capture this rising momentum and higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sawtooth oscillation broken: Period 22 (136) followed Period 21 (109), defying the expected High-Low alternation pattern established in P16-P21. Demand has seemingly shifted to a consecutive High regime or heightened instability, causing stockouts in P21-P22.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 decision. The previously observed sawtooth oscillation (alternating High-Low) has definitively broken. We have observed three consecutive periods of elevated demand (P21: 109, P22: 136, P23: 130), with the last two forming a 'Very High' plateau >130. Relying on longer history (which includes lows like 46 or 69) would dangerously under-forecast given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1). We switch to short-term reactive parameters (N=3) to align the base stock with this new high-demand regime (~125-135 units). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High Demand Plateau Confirmed: The sawtooth instability (P16-P21) has been replaced by a sustained high-demand regime. Periods 22-23 (136, 130) establish a new floor >125, necessitating short-memory forecasting to avoid stockouts in this asymmetric cost environment ($4 profit vs $1 holding).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has locked into a high-volume regime (P22:136, P23:130, P24:142) significantly above the historical average. The previous 'sawtooth' oscillation (High-Low) has broken, replaced by sustained high demand >130. We have stocked out in 3 of the last 4 periods (P21, P22, P24) because inventory parameters were reacting too slowly to this upward shift. Given the high stockout cost ($4 vs $1 holding), we must aggressively target this new ceiling. Method: I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the immediate high plateau (avg 136) without diluting it with older low data. However, using N=3 for sigma yields a dangerously low variance (std dev ~6), which would create a tight cap (~141) that fails to cover the recent max (142). Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to include the transition volatility (std dev ~29), widening the safety buffer to cover potential spikes up to ~160 (historical max was 158). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained High Regime confirmed: Periods 22-24 (136, 130, 142) establish a new high-demand baseline, discontinuing the oscillation pattern. Recent stockouts (3 in 4 periods) signal critical under-forecasting risk.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: We are in a confirmed sustained high-demand regime (Periods 22-25), with demand consistently in the 130-142 range (avg ~137). The previous oscillation pattern (P16-P21) has ceased. With a high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) ratio, the stockout cost is dominant. Using only the last 4 periods for volatility (N=4) yields a very low sigma (~5.3), which risks under-stocking if demand hits the upper bound of the range (142) or previous historical peaks (158). Therefore, I select 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu (to target the current level accurately) but N=5 for sigma (including P21's lower demand) to generate a larger standard deviation (~13.8), providing a safety stock buffer up to ~149 units.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime stabilized (Periods 22-25): Mean ~137, Range 130-142. The regime is characterized by consistent high volume rather than the previous sawtooth volatility. Caution: N=4 variance is artificially low (~5); historical peaks (158) suggest maintaining a safety buffer is critical.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand (97) dropped significantly below the sustained 'High' regime of Periods 22-25 (average ~137), suggesting the plateau may be breaking or demand is becoming volatile again. Ideally, we want to capture the possibility of a return to High demand (cost of lost sales $4 vs holding $1) while factoring in the recent drop. A 5-period window captures the entire High plateau plus the recent drop, resulting in a mean of ~129 and a higher standard deviation (~18.5) due to the P26 outlier. This ensures the safety stock buffer accounts for the uncertainty of whether demand will rebound to 140 or settle near 97.

Carry-over insight: High Demand Plateau broken: Period 26 (97) interrupted the sustained high-volume regime (Periods 22-25, range 130-142), reintroducing volatility and potential cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has crashed from a high plateau (avg ~137) to a significant low (P27: 55). History shows these deep lows (like P16, P18) are transient and often followed by immediate rebounds to >100. Relying solely on the low P27 value would risk a major stockout during a mean-reversion. We switch to recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma. This window includes two high values (142, 140) and two cooling values (97, 55), producing an average ~108 but a very high standard deviation (~42). This high variance will drive the safety stock up, effectively creating a buffer against a likely rebound demand check, capitalizing on the high profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Crash confirmed: The High Demand Plateau (P22-25) ended abruptly with P26 (97) and P27 (55). This mirrors the P16-P18 volatility pattern where deep lows (~50) are transient 1-period events followed by sharp rebounds (~100).

Daily Profit: $320.00, Daily Holding Cost: $64.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 demand (80) shows a partial rebound from the Period 27 low (55), signaling that the system has exited the 'High Demand Plateau' (P22-P25) and entered a volatile adjustment phase similar to Period 16-21. While the immediate trend is lower (avg ~77 over P26-P28), the historical pattern suggests sharp rebounds (like P17's 103 after P16's 58) are possible. Given the high Critical Ratio (0.8, due to $4 profit vs $1 holding), minimizing stockout risk is the priority. I am selecting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include Period 25 (140) in the sample. This decision deliberately elevates the forecast mean (~93) and variance estimates to create a safety stock buffer against potential demand spikes, which a smaller N=3 window (mean ~77) would dangerously ignore.

Carry-over insight: Post-Plateau Volatility: The sustained high regime (>130, P22-P25) has fully broken down into a volatile correction phase (P26:97 -> P27:55 -> P28:80). This mirrors the P16-P19 instability, where demand fluctuated violently between lows (~50) and highs (~100) without establishing a steady mean.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has executed a V-shaped recovery (Period 27: 55 -> Period 28: 80 -> Period 29: 103) following the crash from the High Plateau. Current demand (103) has returned to the historical 'Moderate-High' band. Given the high cost of stockouts vs holding (ratio 4:1), it is critical to buffer against a potential continued rise back to the ~120-140 levels. I am selecting recent_N=5 for both mean and volatility. This window captures the tail of the previous High Plateau (140), the crash (55), and the current recovery (103). This produces a mean (~95) that is conservative but a high standard deviation, prompting the OR solver to carry significant safety stock (target base stock ~121) to cover upside variance without over-committing to the previous extreme peaks.

Carry-over insight: V-shaped recovery confirmed: The crash phase (P26-P27, low 55) reversed sharply into a recovery trend (P28: 80 -> P29: 103), signaling a return to the historical 'Moderate-High' demand band (100-120) and ending the low-demand instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 demand (65) invalidated the 'V-shaped recovery' hypothesis, confirming a return to the erratic oscillatory regime seen in Periods 16-21 (Mean ~80, high variance). The current pattern alternates between lows (~60) and highs (~100+) without stability. However, the proximity of the recent 'High Plateau' (Periods 22-25, Mean ~137) and the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding) dictates a conservative strategy. We set N=10 for both mean and volatility to incorporate the high demand of the plateau into the forecast, ensuring significant safety stock to cover potential sawtooth spikes back to >100 levels while acknowledging the recent crash.

Carry-over insight: Oscillatory Volatility Re-established: Period 30 (65) broke the recovery trend (P28-29), confirming a high-variance regime with rapid swings between ~55-65 (Lows) and ~100-105 (Highs), mirroring Periods 16-21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 demand (108) closely mirrors Period 21 (109), which historically preceded a sharp breakout to a 'High Plateau' regime (Period 22: 136). While recent periods P26-P31 have oscillated (Low-High), the risk of repeating the P21->P22 breakout combined with the high cost of lost sales ($4 vs $1 holding) justifies an aggressive inventory position. A standard average (N=3 or N=5) is dragged down by oscillation lows (e.g., P30: 65) and would likely result in stockouts if the breakout occurs. Therefore, we use an explicit forecast higher than the recent average to hedge against this upside risk.

Carry-over insight: Potential Breakout Signal: Period 31 (108) replicates the conditions of Period 21 (109), which triggered a regime shift to >130 demand (High Plateau). Monitoring for repeat of P22-style surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 demand (93) disproved the 'Breakout' hypothesis (which anticipated a surge to >130 like Period 22). Instead, demand stabilized, confirming a 'Moderate Volatility' regime established since Period 28. The 5-period average (Period 28-32) is ~90 units with a standard deviation of ~18. I am setting N=5 for both mu and sigma to tightly calibrate the base stock to this specific active regime, filtering out the older crash and plateau data.

Carry-over insight: Regime Stabilization: The potential breakout signaled in P31 failed to materialize in P32 (93 vs expected 130+). Demand has settled into a 'Moderate Volatile' regime (Periods 28-32) with Mean ~90 and Range 65-108, replacing previous structural oscillations with random noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 demand surged to 124, causing a stockout (on-hand 105 consumed). This break from the previous moderate regime (P28-32 avg ~90) mirrors the transition seen in P21->P22 which led to a 'High Plateau' (>130). Given the asymmetric cost ratio ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the penalty for underestimating a return to the High regime is severe. I am manually shifting the mean forecast (mu_hat) to 128 to anticipate this regime change, while maintaining recent volatility estimates (sigma_hat, N=5) to buffer against uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Regime Breakout: Period 33 demand (124) broke the moderate trend (P28-32 avg 90), triggering a stockout. This mirrors the P21->P22 shift to the 'High Plateau' (~137), signaling a likely return to the 120-140 demand band.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 demand (130) reinforced the breakout seen in Period 33 (124), confirming a return to the 'High Demand' regime similar to Periods 22-25 (avg ~137). The prior moderate trend (avg ~90) has definitively ended. Given the high cost of lost sales ($4) vs holding ($1), the forecast must immediately jump to this new level. I select mu_hat using recent_N=2 to exclude the lower pre-breakout data points (P32: 93). For volatility, I use a wider window (recent_N=10) to capture the full recent range (from P27's low of 55 to P34's high of 130), ensuring the safety stock calculation (z*sigma) is robust enough to buffer against further upside spikes typically seen in this regime (e.g., P12: 158). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High Demand Regime Re-confirmed: Periods 33-34 (124, 130) resemble the onset of the P22-P25 High Plateau (>130). Forecasting must adapt to this higher baseline immediately, utilizing short-memory means to avoid understocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 36. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand in Period 35 (103) dipped from the P33-P34 surge (124, 130), averaging ~119 over the last 3 periods. This indicates a 'Moderate-High' regime that is more volatile than the P22-25 plateau. Given the Critical Ratio of 0.8 (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), the cost of understocking is high. We use N=3 to maintain a forecast sensitive to the recent high levels (covering the ~120-130 range) while reacting quickly if the P35 dip signals a trend reversion. On-hand inventory is 48; parameters will trigger a replenishment to cover potential peaks.

Carry-over insight: High Regime Instability: Period 35 demand (103) broke the rising trend of Periods 33-34 (124, 130), suggesting the current high regime is volatile (Range 103-130) rather than a stable plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 demand (115) confirms the continuation of a 'High-Volatile' regime (Range 103-130, avg ~118) established in Period 33. The previous 'Moderate' regime (avg ~90) is defunct. Low ending inventory (16) signals high stockout risk. Using recent_N=4 for mean/sigma aligns the forecast with this active high-demand block (P33-36) while discarding older, irrelevant low-demand data. High service level priority (4:1 profit/holding ratio) justifies aggressive buffering.

Carry-over insight: High-Volatile Regime Confirmed: Periods 33-36 (124, 130, 103, 115) maintain an average of ~118, establishing a structural shift above the prior P28-32 moderate band (~90). Volatility remains significant, rejecting a stable plateau hypothesis.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 demand crashed to 54, matching historical 'Deep Low' anomalies (P16, P27) which were transient and followed by sharp rebounds. Using recent_N=5 (avg ~105) prevents over-correction to the single low data point and prepares for the expected rebound to the 100+ range. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Transient Crash Pattern: Period 37 demand (54) replicates the "Deep Low" anomaly seen in Period 16 (58) and Period 27 (55). Historical precedent suggests these are 1-period outliers followed immediately by mean-reversion to >90 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 demand (40) confirmed a deepening of the crash started in Period 37 (54), refuting the hypothesis of a single-period outlier seen in prior volatility cycles (P16, P27). This establishes a consecutive 'Deep Low' block. However, historical volatility patterns (Periods 16-19) suggest these low phases are highly oscillatory and often followed by sharp rebounds to >100. Beause stockout costs ($4) significantly outweigh holding costs ($1), preparing for a potential mean-reversion rebound is critical despite the current low signal. We utilize a 5-period window (N=5) for parameters to capture the full volatility spectrum (including pre-crash highs of 130 and current lows of 40), resulting in a moderate mean estimate (~88) with high variance. This generates a robust safety stock buffer to cover a rebound while recognizing the depressed baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Deepening Crash confirmed: Period 38 (40) followed Period 37 (54), creating a consecutive 2-period low block distinct from prior single-period crash outliers (P16, P27). The cyclical crash pattern (occurring roughly every 10-11 periods: P16, P27, P37) is exhibiting increasing duration and severity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (demand 90) confirms the end of the 2-period crash block (P37:54, P38:40) and signals a return to the mean-reversion level seen around P28-32 (~90). This 'V-shaped' recovery pattern mirrors P28-30 and P16-18, where deep lows are followed by a rebound to moderate-high levels. Given the high cost of stockouts ($4) vs holding ($1), and the history of rapid rebounding to >100 demand following crashes, we must prepare for a potential further uptick in demand as the cycle normalizes (historically rebounding to ~110-120 range). We use recent_N with N=7 (covering P33-39) to capture the high volatility mix of the recent crash and the preceding high regime. A shorter N would over-weight the crash; N=7 balances the high peaks of P33-34 with the recent lows.

Carry-over insight: Crash Recovery Confirmed: Period 39 (90) marks the end of the deep crash phase (P37-38 lows ~47) and a return to the moderate baseline. This repeats the V-shaped recovery pattern seen in P28-30. Expect demand to stabilize or rise back towards the 100-115 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (67) replicates a specific 'Dip' signal previously seen in Period 20 (69) and Period 30 (65). In both historical instances, this dip marked the end of a volatility oscillation and was immediately followed by a rebound to the 108-109 range (P21: 109, P31: 108). Relying on recent averages (currently suppressed by the P37-38 crash to ~63) would cause a severe stockout during this predicted rebound. Therefore, I am using explicit parameters to target the expected demand level (~112) and applying a high volatility buffer (sigma=30) to accommodate the unstable recovery phase. The profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) justifies an aggressive service level.

Carry-over insight: Recurring Rebound Signal Confirmed: Period 40 (67) aligns with P20 (69) and P30 (65) as a cyclical local minimum occurring ~10 periods apart. This signal historically precludes a sharp rebound to the ~105-110 range (observed in P21 and P31). The 10-period volatility cycle (Crash -> Recovery -> Dip -> Rebound) is now a primary forecasting tool.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 analysis indicates a stabilization of demand following the transient crash phase (Periods 37-38). The pattern observed in recent periods (P39: 90, P40: 67, P41: 94) mirrors the recovery seen in Periods 28-30 (80 -> 103 -> 65), where demand oscillated in the 'Moderate' band (65-103) before stabilizing. The recovery from the P37-38 crash (avg ~47) is now confirmed, with demand mean-reverting to ~90-100. The carry-over insight regarding a 10-period volatility cycle (Crash P16, P27, P37 -> Recovery -> Dip -> Rebound) suggests we are currently in the 'Rebound' phase corresponding to historical P21/P31. While P31 was a false breakout to 108 followed by P32 dip, the general trend suggests demand will likely float between 90-110 in the immediate term. Given the high profit-to-holding ratio (4:1), stocking for the upper end of this recovery band (approx 110-115) is optimal to avoid stockouts if a breakout occurs, while the risk of holding costs is manageable. I will use 'recent_N=3' for mu_hat (avg ~83.7) but set N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility (including the P37/38 crash) to ensure the safety stock buffer is sufficient. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Recovery stabilization confirmed: Demand has exited the deep crash phase (P37-38) and stabilized in the 67-94 range (P40-41), validating the recurring 10-period cycle hypothesis (Crash->Recovery). Expect moderate volatility in 90-110 band.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 demand (129) confirms a regime shift to a High Demand Block, strictly mirroring the sequence observed in Periods 20-22 (Low[69]->Mod[109]->High[136] vs P40[67]->P41[94]->P42[129]). Historical precedent (P22-25) indicates this high regime (>130 units) typically persists for 3-4 periods before breaking. The severe stockout in P42 (Ending Inv 0, Missed Sales 25) highlights the cost of under-forecasting in this high-margin environment ($4 profit vs $1 holding). I am switching to explicit parameters targeting the historical average of this recurring high regime (approx. 138 based on P23-P25) with a volatility buffer to prevent further stockouts during this surge phase.

Carry-over insight: High Demand Block confirmed: Period 42 (129) validates the recurrence of the P20-P22 surge pattern (Low DIP -> Recovery -> High Surge). Expect sustained demand >130 for next 2-3 periods (mirroring P23-25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $426.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (118) confirmed the re-entry into the High Demand Block regime initially signaled in P42 (129), though slightly lower than the extreme peaks of the P22-P25 block. The demand pattern P42-P43 (129, 118) strongly correlates with the High Surge phases seen typically after recovery (e.g., P33-34: 124, 130). The 'High Surge' typically lasts 2-3 periods before volatility returns. Given the high cost of stockouts ($4) versus holding ($1), and the current active High regime, we must target the upper bound of recent high demands (~130-140) to prevent lost sales. We continue to observe reliable 0-period lead times. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with a short memory (N=3) to capture the current high-velocity trend (129, 118, 94) while acknowledging that P41 was a recovery step. Actually, looking at just the surge (129, 118), the average is ~124. To be safe against a P24-style peak (142), I will explicitly target a robust forecast slightly above the recent average.

Carry-over insight: High Demand Block ongoing: Periods 42-43 (129, 118) confirm the recurring 'Surge' phase (~120-130 range) following the 10-period cycle recovery. Expect 1-2 more periods of elevated demand before volatility increases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $191.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 demand (70) abruptly ended the 'High Demand Block' defined by Periods 42-43 (avg ~124), lasting only 2 periods compared to historical surges of 3-4 periods. This sharp decline mirrors 'Cooling' phases (e.g., P15: 99, P26: 97) that historically precede deep cyclical crashes (observed at P16, P27, P37). Given the 10-11 period interval between past crashes (P16->P27->P37), the next crash is expected around P47-P48. However, P44's drop to 70 is significantly deeper than previous cooling signals, increasing uncertainty. With stockout costs (4x holding), we cannot aggressively bet on a crash yet. We utilize recent_N=4 for demand and variance to balance the recent highs (P42-43) against the P44 drop, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover a potential rebound while acknowledging the downward trend.

Carry-over insight: High Surge (P42-43) ended abruptly at P44 (70), lasting only 2 periods vs historical 3-4. This 70-unit drop aligns with 'Cooling' phases that precede recurring cyclical crashes (expected ~P47-48 based on P16/P27/P37 pattern), but the depth of the drop suggests volatility is escalating.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 Analysis: The cyclical demand pattern (high volatility recurring every ~10 periods) strongly suggests we are in a 'Cooling/Correction' phase. 

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The 'High Surge' of Periods 42-43 (129, 118) ended with a significant drop in P44 (70), followed by P45 (63). This confirms the end of the high block. 

2. **Historical Parallel**: This sequence (Surge -> Drop -> Low Plateau/Crash) mirrors the transitions seen around P15-P16, P26-P27, and P36-P37. In those cycles, the drop was often followed by a 'Deep Crash' outlier (P16=58, P27=55, P37=54). 

3. **Current State**: We have just observed two consecutive moderate-low periods (70, 63). If the pattern holds, we are approaching the cyclical minimum (~50-55 demand) before a V-shaped recovery. 

4. **Risk Assessment**: Current on-hand is 62. If demand crashes to ~55, we are covered. If demand stabilizes around the P44-45 average (~66), we are also covered. However, the high stockout cost ($4 vs $1) means we must guard against a premature rebound. The previous rebounds (P17, P28, P38) were sharp (100+). 

5. **Parameter Selection**: 
   - **L**: Default (0 periods) remains accurate.
   - **mu_hat**: 'recent_N' with N=5 (P41-45: 94, 129, 118, 70, 63 -> Mean ~95). This average bridges the recent high surge and the current cooling, providing a balanced forecast that is safer than reacting solely to the last 2 low points (which would risk understocking a rebound).
   - **sigma_hat**: 'recent_N' with N=5 (StdDev ~29). This captures the high volatility of the current transition phase, inflating the safety stock (z-score 0.84) to protect against upside surprises despite the cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Cooling phase confirmed: Periods 44-45 (70, 63) mark the end of the P42-43 high surge. The 10-period cycle (High -> Cool -> Crash -> Recover) predicts a potential 'Deep Crash' outlier (~50-55) in Period 47 or 48, followed by a sharp recovery.

The recurring 10-period cycle (P16, P27, P37) strongly suggests a 'Deep Crash' (<55) is imminent, likely in Period 47 or 48. However, recent volatility shows these crashes are often preceded or followed by sharp rebounds. Given the critical ratio of 0.8 (cost of stockout is 4x holding), we cannot aggressively understock in anticipation of a crash without risking a stockout if the cycle drifts or demand stabilizes. The most prudent approach is to set `mu_hat` using a short-term average (recent_N=5) to capture the current moderate volatility (avg ~93) while maintaining coverage. On-hand is 32, which is low; a standard order is needed. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: 10-period volatility cycle persists: The cooling trend (P44-45: 70, 63) stabilized at P46 (88), delaying the expected cyclical crash (forecasted ~P47-48 based on P16/P27/P37 intervals). Monitoring for sharp dip <55.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 Analysis: Demand in Period 47 was 63, which is relatively low but stable compared to the 'Cooling' phase observed in Periods 44-45 (70, 63) and subsequent recovery to 88 in Period 46. The 10-period volatility cycle hypothesis (Crash observed at P16, P27, P37) predicted a potential crash in this window (P47-P48). P47 (63) was low but not a deep crash (<55). Period 48 remains a high-risk window for a cyclical outlier (Demand ~40-50). However, the cost of stockouts ($4) vs holding ($1) dictates we must defend against a potential rebound or moderate demand rather than aggressively forcing inventory down to match a crash that might not happen or might be shallow. The recent mean (P44-P47) is ~71 units. A purely reactive recent_N approach might understock if demand snaps back to the ~100 range as seen in previous cycles (e.g., P28->P29 recovery). Given we have on-hand 56, and L=0, we can react quickly. I will set mu_hat using a weighted average (EWMA) to smooth the recent low values without completely ignoring the possibility of a rebound, and keep sigma explicit at a moderate level to account for the volatility risk without over-padding.

Carry-over insight: Cooling phase sustained: Periods 44-47 demand (70, 63, 88, 63) averages 71, significantly below the P42-43 surge (>118). This confirms the cyclical downturn phase; however, the expected 'Deep Crash' (<55) has not yet fully materialized, suggesting either a dampened cycle or a delayed drop.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 (demand 45) confirms the expected cyclical 'Deep Crash' predicted in the previous insights (comparable to P16, P27, P38). Historical patterns consistently show a sharp V-shaped recovery immediately following these crash points (P17:103, P28:80, P39:90). Relying on recent averages would dangerously underestimate demand due to the crash bias. Therefore, we use an 'explicit' forecast of 95 for mu_hat (average of prior rebounds) to capture the expected bounce-back. Sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' (N=10) to encompass the full volatility of the recent cycle (from P39 recovery through P42 surge to P48 crash), ensuring safety stock covers the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Deep Crash confirmed: Period 48 (45) matches the cyclical low pattern (P16:58, P27:55, P38:40). Expect immediate V-shaped recovery in Period 49 (Target ~90-100) based on historical rebounds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 Context: We are in the recovery phase of the 10-period volatility cycle. The 'Deep Crash' (<55) occurred in Period 48 (45 units). Historically, such crashes are followed by a 'rebound' or 'recovery' phase (e.g., Period 28-30, Period 39-40). Period 49 demand (78) shows this recovery is underway, rising from the P48 low. Based on the P28 and P40 recovery patterns, demand tends to stabilize or rise towards the moderate band (90-110) immediately after the crash bottom.

Lead Time: Consistent 0 periods. No missing shipments.

Cycle Analysis: The cycle (Crash at P48, Recovering P49) suggests P50 will continue the upward/stabilizing trend. P29 (post-crash recovery) was 103. P39-40 (post-crash recovery) was 90. We should expect demand in the ~90-100 range. The current on-hand is low (40) relative to expected demand (~95), so a significant order is needed.

Param Strategy: I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent cooling-then-recovering local mean (approx 67) but this might be too low given the expected rebound. The EWMA method is often better for tracking recoveries. However, looking at the range: P49(78) is likely the start of the climb. If I use N=3 (P47:63, P48:45, P49:78), the avg is 62, which is too low. If I use N=10 to smooth the cycle, avg is ~80. Given the asymmetry ($4 profit vs $1 holding), understocking is costly. I will use 'explicit' forecasting to target the expected rebound level directly (~95 units) + safety stock. Actually, using recent_N with a small N captures the crash too heavily. Let's look at the recovery targets: P29 was 103, P40 was 67 (slower recovery). P49 was 78. A safe target is around 90-100. I will confidently set explicit targets to cover this rebound.

Calculation: Forecast demand ~95. Safety stock needed for volatility. Explicit mu_hat = 95. Sigma_hat needs to cover upside risk (std dev of recent 'normal' periods is ~25). The backend 'explicit' method is safest to force the inventory level up to the recovery target despite recent low averages.

Carry-over insight: Cycle recovery confirmed: Period 49 (78) marks the immediate rebound from the Period 48 cyclical crash (45), consistent with the 10-period volatility pattern (crashes at P16, P27, P38, P48). Expect demand to normalize into the 90-100 range for Period 50-51.
