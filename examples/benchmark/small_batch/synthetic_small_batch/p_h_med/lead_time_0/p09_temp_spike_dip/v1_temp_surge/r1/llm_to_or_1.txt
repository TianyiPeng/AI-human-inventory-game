Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. I have historical demand data for periods 1-5, which I will use to initialize my parameters. The demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106]. The average demand is ~114.4 and the standard deviation is ~15.7. Since this is the first period, knowing the calendar or seasonal context isn't possible beyond the provided generic period labels. The promised lead time is 0. I will start with a conservative estimation using the full historical average and standard deviation (N=5 for the samples I was given in the prompt). The critical fractile is 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Using 'explicit' for mu and sigma allows me to set the initial forecast based on the pre-game history provided. Since L=0 and I account for review period (1 observed + 0 lead), the demand horizon is effectively 1 period. 

Calculations:
Avg = (131+92+118+125+106)/5 = 114.4.
Std Dev (sample) approx 15.7.

Since I need to cover Period 1 demand (review period) + Lead Time (0), I need to cover 1 period of risk. 
mu_hat = 1 * 114.4 = 114.4
sigma_hat = sqrt(1) * 15.7 = 15.7

I will use explicit values to ground the initial decision firmly on the provided history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. On-hand 42. Period 1 demand (86) was lower than the provided historical samples (avg ~114), but lead time behaved as promised (0 periods). Given the small sample size of actual game data, I will blend the historical samples with the recent observation to form a robust prior. Using explicit values for mu and sigma to ensure the historical context is captured accurately, as the backend's default memory may not include the prompt-provided samples. L remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (P1 order arrived same period); Demand P1 (86) below historical average (114) but within normal volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 demand (132) exceeded available inventory (127), resulting in a stockout. Observed demand volatility is extremely high (P1: 86 vs P2: 132). Combining historical samples (mean ~114) with recent game data (mean 109), the overall average is ~113. However, given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit ratio) and the recent spike, I am setting explicit parameters to buffer against variance. I use mu=115 and a higher sigma=25 (vs historical ~15) to increase safety stock. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High demand volatility confirmed (P1: 86, P2: 132). Period 2 stockout occurred due to demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 4. Observed lead time consistently 0 periods (orders arrive same period) across P1-P3, so using recent_N=3 for L to reflect this instant delivery reality. Demand has been highly volatile (86, 132, 100) with a stockout occuring in Period 2. The recent average (106) is slightly lower than the preamble historical average (~114), but recent variance is higher. Choosing recent_N=3 for mu and sigma forces the system to use the higher recent standard deviation (~24 vs long-term ~16), increasing safety stock to better protect against spikes like P2 (132).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed 0 (consistent P1-3). Volatility remains high (StdDev ~24 on base ~106), requiring larger safety buffers than historical average suggests.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods, matching the promise. Actual demand (Last 4: 86, 132, 100, 75; Mean ~98) continues to show high volatility (StdDev ~25) and diverges significantly from the initial historical forecast provided in the prompt (which predicted 125 for P4 vs actual 75). Consequently, I am using 'recent_N=4' for all parameters to calibrate strictly to the realized game dynamics rather than the unreliable pre-game forecast. This sets the base stock using the observed higher volatility to protect against spikes like Period 2 while adjusting the mean to current realities.

Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observations from Periods 1-5 show a consistent Lead Time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand over these 5 periods (86, 132, 100, 75, 106) yields a mean of ~100 and a standard deviation of ~22. The observed mean (99.8) is noticeably lower than the pre-game historical mean (114.4), suggesting a regime shift to lower average demand, though volatility remains high (ranging from 75 to 132). Given the critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 / (4+1)), the controller will use the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) for all parameters. This aligns the inventory policy with the actual observed game dynamics (lower mean, high variance, L=0) rather than the outdated pre-game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: 5-period observed average (99.8) is consistently lower than pre-game history (114.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (instant arrival). Observed Period 6 demand (77) reinforces the lower-demand regime identified in Period 6; the average demand over P1-P6 is ~96, significantly below the pre-game average of ~114. I am setting N=6 for all parameters to explicitly use the full in-game history, which captures the lower mean and the observed volatility (StdDev ~20) more accurately than pre-game priors.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 8. Lead time consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival in same period). Demand shows a sustained downward trend; the average over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 85.0 units, significantly lower than the pre-game historical average (~114) and the early game volatility. The most recent demand (P7: 67) is the lowest recorded. To prevent overstocking in this lower-volume regime while maintaining service, I am aligning parameters to the recent 5-period window (P3-P7). This excludes the high initial history and the P2 outlier (132), producing a base stock that better matches current consumption (~85 mean). With on-hand inventory at 48 and pipeline at 0, the computed order will replenish up to the localized base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand Downshift Confirmed: Last 5 periods avg (85.0) is ~25% lower than pre-game avg (~114). P7 demand (67) is lowest recorded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 saw a significant demand rebound to 127 after a low of 67 effectively breaking the downward trend observed in P4-P7 (avg ~81). This spike resulted in a stockout. The 5-period average (P4-P8) demand is now ~90.4. Due to high volatility (range 67-132), sticking to a recent demand average (N=5) captures the current fluctuating regime better than the long-term history. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as high: Period 8 spiked to 127 after Period 7 low of 67, causing stockout. Downward trend broken.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 decision. Confirmed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current inventory is critically low (2 units) following a near-stockout in Period 9 (demand 110 vs capacity 112). Demand history shows extreme volatility: recent observations include aggressive swings (127 in P8, 110 in P9) after a low period (67 in P7). The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 97.7 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 22.8. However, the recent spike (P8, P9) suggests the low-demand regime (P4-P7) might be ending or was simply high variance. Given the high stockout cost (lost profit $4 vs holding $1, critical ratio 0.8), I will prioritize service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (full observed history) for mu_hat to capture the full range of volatility, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the actual dispersion observed so far. This effectively sets the base stock to cover even the recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: On-hand inventory is critically low (10 units) following three periods of sustained high demand (P8:127, P9:110, P10:108). This sequence confirms that the low-demand dip observed in P6-P7 has ended, and demand has reverted to pre-game historical averages (~114). Lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent stockouts given the low starting inventory, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N=3' (approx avg 115) to react quickly to the restored demand level, disregarding the lower P6-P7 data. I will keep sigma_hat on 'recent_N=5' to capture the high volatility shown in the P7-P8 swing.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P8-P10 average (115.0) signals a return to historical pre-game levels (~114), effectively ending the low-demand regime detected in periods 6-7.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is critically low (11 units). Demand recovery has solidified: average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 117.5, slightly exceeding the pre-game average (~114) and well above the mid-game suppression. I am excluding Period 7 (67 units) from the mean calculation (using N=4) to prevent the low outlier from dragging down the forecast and causing stockouts. However, I am retaining a longer history for volatility (N=10) to capture the full range of recent swings (e.g., P2's 132, P8's 127) and ensure adequate safety stock. Lead time consistently confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $523.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed via Period 12 conclude). Demand has been robust recently: P8=127, P9=110, P10=108, P11=125, P12=132. The average for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is ~120.4, which is slightly above the pre-game historical average of ~114. This confirms the 'demand recovery' noticed in Period 11 has sustained and possibly strengthened into a higher-demand regime. Volatility is also noticeable (range 108-132 recently). Given the critical ratio is high (4/(4+1) = 0.8), service level is prioritized. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent strong demand trend (approx 120), rather than diluting it with the low demand from periods 4-7. Sigma will also use recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility profile (StdDev ~10). Lead time is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: P8-P12 average (120.4) exceeds pre-game history (114), suggesting sustained stronger sales.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are firmly in a high-demand regime (P8-P13), with an average demand of ~119 units, significantly above the prior low period and slightly above the pre-game historical average (114). Volatility in this new regime is moderate (StdDev ~10.2). Given the critical ratio of 0.8 (Profit 4 vs Holding 1), we optimize for an 80% in-stock rate. The observed max demand in this regime (132) represents the ~83rd percentile, meaning occasional stockouts on peak days are economically optimal. We select N=6 for both mu and sigma to tightly calibrate the base stock level to this active high-demand period (P8 onwards). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: Current on-hand is 30 units with 0 units in-transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand analysis reveals a stabilization trend: after the 'recovery surge' in periods 8-12 (avg ~120), the demand has settled. The most recent 5-period average (P10-14) is 115.0, which is nearly identical to the pre-game historical mean of 114.4. This suggests the high-demand volatility is cooling off into a steady state. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this stabilized regime (avg ~115, std_dev ~13.6) and exclude the older, irrelevant low-demand data from Periods 4-7. This setting balances the target base stock to cover the mean plus a safety buffer for occasional spikes (like P12's 132), maximizing profit given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Recent 5-period avg (115.0) mirrors pre-game mean (114.4), signaling end of the recovery surge and a return to historical norms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 16 context: On-hand inventory is dangerously low (13 units) following Period 15 demand of 114, which aligns perfectly with the historical pre-game average. The 'high demand' regime seen in P11-13 appears to have moderated, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 116.2 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the critical ratio of 0.8, avoiding stockouts is key. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the stabilized mean without dragging in the older low-demand outliers from P6-P7. For sigma_hat, I am using a longer horizon (N=10) to incorporate the full volatility observed recently (ranges from 67 to 132), ensuring the safety stock buffer accounts for the potential of sudden spikes or drops seen in the medium term.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 experienced a massive demand spike (195 units), which is 71% higher than the recent average of ~114. This spike caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the penalty for understocking is severe compared to overstocking. Therefore, we switch to a responsive 'recent_N' (N=5) strategy for both mean and volatility. This incorporates the high demand and the increased variance from Period 16 into the base stock calculation, ensuring a larger safety buffer to protect against potential continued instability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Major demand spike (195 units) broke the prior stabilization trend, causing a stockout and significantly increasing demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Critical context: Two consecutive stockouts (P16, P17) driven by an explosive demand surge (114 -> 195 -> 251). Current on-hand is 0. The demand pattern suggests a severe upward regime shift or major seasonality peaking. To arrest lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must aggressively update forecast parameters. Using N=3 for mean and volatility captures the recent spike while providing a high variance estimate to generate a large safety stock buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Severe demand surge confirmed: P16 (195) and P17 (251) indicate a new explosive demand regime, effectively doubling the historical average (~114).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: We are deep in a high-demand regime (Regime 3). The last 3 periods (P16-P18) have averaged 211.7 units, significantly above the historical norm of ~114. Although demand dipped slightly from the P17 peak (251) to P18 (189), it remains nearly double the historical average. With a profit margin of 80% (Profit=4, Holding=1), the cost of stocking out is high, as evidenced by consecutive stockouts in P16 and P17. I am using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus strictly on this new explosive regime and ignore pre-surge data. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Explosive demand regime sustained: P16-P18 average (211.7) confirms a major upward shift despite P18 dipping to 189 from P17 peak.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: We remain in a significantly elevated demand regime that began in Period 16. Although demand has cooled slightly from the Period 17 peak (251) to current levels (189, 177), the recent 4-period average (203.0) is nearly double the historical pre-game mean (~114). With the Critical Ratio at 0.8 (cost of stockout is 4x holding), we must prioritize availability. We continue to use 'recent_N' with N=4 to calibrate the base stock against this specific high-demand window (P16-P19), capturing the increased mean and volatility (~33 std dev). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime persists: P16-P19 average (203.0) confirms sustained structural shift (~78% above historical mean), despite slight stabilization from P17 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 begins with 0 inventory following a massive demand spike in Period 20 (254 units), which caused a stockout. The demand pattern has shifted drastically since Period 16. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 213.2 units, nearly double the pre-Period 16 average. The variance has also increased significantly (values ranging from 177 to 254). The last 5-period volatility (std dev) is approximately ~36 units. Given the high stockout penalty (ratio 0.8) and the proven explosive demand regime, I must abandon long-term averages and rely strictly on the recent 5-period window to capture this new 'high consumption' state. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Explosive demand regime reinforced: P20 demand (254) is a new high, bringing the 5-period average (P16-P20) to 213.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $946.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 check. Demand continues to be explosive in the new regime (Period 16 onwards). Period 21 demand was 238, following 254 in Period 20. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 217 units, significantly higher than the historical pre-game average of ~114. The standard deviation in this high-demand regime is also very high (ranging from 177 to 254). Given the critical ratio of 0.8, we must maintain aggressive inventory levels to capture sales. Since start of P16, every single lead time has been 0, so we continue with default L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), relying on the entire history would severely under-forecast because the recent shift is structural and massive. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture strictly this new high-demand regime (P16-P21).

Carry-over insight: Explosive demand regime sustained: P16-P21 average (217.3) confirms structural shift is permanent for now.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 begins with 0 inventory after another near-stockout event (Demand 250, Supply 247). Demand has stabilized at a very high plateau over the last 3 periods (Average = 247.3), which is significantly higher than the initial surge average. Given the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we must chase this mean aggressively. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to align with this localized peak (~247 units). However, the volatility over the entire surge period (P16-current) is significant (ranging 177 to 254), so I will use a larger window (N=7) for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock buffer accounts for these broader swings, preventing stockouts if demand spikes to ~255 again.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand upward shift confirmed: P20-P22 average (247.3) is distinctly higher than the initial P16-P19 surge average (~203), suggesting the high-demand regime has intensified.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24. Demand in Period 23 (184) dipped from the P20-P22 highs (~247 avg), confirming significant volatility within the high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The regime (P16-P23) oscillates between ~180 and ~250 units with an average of 217.3. Lead time remains consistently 0. To address this high-variance structural shift and prevent further stockouts (observed in P20/P22), I will calculate parameters using the full length of the current regime (N=8). This balances the peaks (~250) against the troughs (~180) for a robust safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: High volatility sustained in explosive regime: P23 demand (184) confirms oscillation pattern (range 177-254) seen since P16. Average of current regime (P16-P23) is 217.3.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We remain in the high-demand regime that began in Period 16, but specifically the 'intensified' sub-regime identified from Period 20 onwards. The average of the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is ~233 units, which is higher than the P16-P24 average (~220 units) due to the lower initial ramp-up in P18/19. With on-hand inventory critically low at 8 units and a high cost of stockouts ($4 profit margin), we select N=5 for our estimators. This ensures our base stock targets the higher recent mean (~233) rather than diluting it with older data, maximizing protection against the frequent 250+ peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $598.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. The high-demand regime identified in Period 16 persists, with demand oscillating significantly between ~171 and ~254 units. The average demand over this entire 10-period regime (P16-P25) is approximately 215 units, with substantial volatility (std dev ~34). We select 'recent_N' with N=10 for both demand and volatility to utilize the full data history of this specific regime, providing a robust estimate that smooths the oscillation while capturing the elevated structural mean.

Carry-over insight: Regime oscillation sustained: Period 25 demand (171) matches previous lows, confirming a high-variance pattern (171-254 range). The 10-period regime average (P16-P25) stabilizes at ~215 units, correcting the prior upward trend hypothesis.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 demand dropped significantly to 95 units, breaking the established high-volatility regime range (171-254) observed over the last 10 periods. This 55% drop from the recent average (~215) suggests the explosive demand phase may be ending or pausing. Given the 0-period lead time, the system can react quickly. I am switching to recent_N=5 to blend the recent high demand data with this new low signal; this prevents an immediate stockout if demand bounces back while starting to lower inventory targets if the drop is sustained.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential regime collapse: Period 26 demand (95) fell far below the established high-demand range (171-254), indicating the explosive regime may have ended.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 demand (84) reinforces the abrupt regime collapse signaled in Period 26 (95). The average of the last two periods (~90 units) is significantly below both the recent explosive regime (~215 units) and the historical pre-game average (~114 units). This indicates a return to the low-demand conditions seen in P6-P8. Given the current high on-hand inventory (156 units), the system needs to destock. We switch to 'explicit' forecasting to immediately reflect this new low activity level (mu=90) without lag from the high-demand history, while maintaining a conservative variance estimate (sigma=30) to cover potential fluctuations as the regime stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Regime collapse confirmed: P26-P27 average (89.5) marks a definitive end to the explosive regime (P16-P25 avg ~215) and a drop below historical norms (~114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $449.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Explosive regime (P16-P25) has ended. Demand P26-P28 (95, 84, 121) establishes a new lower regime with an average of 100, though P28 hints at a return to pre-game norms (~114). Using recent_N=3 isolates this new reality, excluding the high-demand distortion from prior periods. Lead time stays 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: P28 (121) suggests a return to historical range (90-130) after the P26-P27 crash, averaging 100 for the new post-explosive regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized following the collapse of the explosive regime. The last 4 periods (P26-P29) show an average demand of 99.5 (samples: 95, 84, 121, 98), which is stable compared to the explosive era (avg ~215) and slightly below the pre-game history (~114). We explicitly choose N=4 for estimation to exclude Period 25 (171 units) and ensure the forecast reflects only the new 'normal' regime. Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive stabilization confirmed: P26-P29 avg is 99.5, significantly below the P16-P25 surge (~215) and stabilizing near pre-game norms.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31. The explosive demand regime (P16-P25) has definitively ended. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show a stabilized 'post-explosive' regime with an average demand of 103.0 units and moderate volatility (range 84-121). A minor stockout occurred in Period 30 (demand 117 vs 113 available) because the recent dip in P26-P27 dragged the moving average down too far. To correct this and accurately capture the current variance, I am selecting N=5 for both mean and volatility. This window captures exactly the new regime since the crash, excluding the high-demand outliers of the past while reacting to the P28/P30 recovery spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive regime stabilized: P26-P30 average (103.0) confirms a new normal slightly below pre-game history (114), but volatility remains relevant (stockout in P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized in a post-explosive regime (P26-P31) with an average of ~104 units, significantly below the prior surge but consistent with pre-game history. The regime is stationary but experienced a stockout in P30 due to a minor spike (117). We switch parameters to 'recent_N=6' to isolate this new stable period, excluding the high-variance explosive data from P25 and earlier. Current on-hand is low (10), so accurate replenishment is critical.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive regime stability confirmed: P26-P31 average (103.7) defines the new normal, effectively replacing the high-demand era.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 demand (112) confirms the stability of the post-explosive regime (P26-P32 average ~105). The high-demand era (P16-P25) is now irrelevant. I am setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to strictly use the data since the P26 crash, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current stable demand (~100-110 range) rather than the older surge (~200+). Inventory is critical (4 units), so relying on precise recent history is key for immediate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive stable regime sustained: P26-P32 average (104.9) confirms demand has settled near 105 units, consistently below pre-game history (114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 decision. Demand has clearly stabilized in the post-explosive era. While the immediate post-crash periods (P26-P27) saw very low demand (95, 84), the subsequent recovery phase (P28-P33) has settled into a consistent range (approx 98-121) with an average of ~109.5. This is slightly below the pre-game average of 114 but represents a distinct, stable regime. I am effectively excluding the P26-P27 'crash' outliers to target the more representative recovery level. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined stability regime: Excluding the initial crash (P26-P27), the P28-P33 recovery period shows a stable average of 109.5 units with reduced volatility, defining the current 'new normal'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Demand has stabilized in the post-explosive regime. The average demand from P28 to P34 is ~105 units. Period 34 showed a lower demand (80), but the overall trend fits a stable distribution around 105. We use recent_N=7 for mu and sigma to focus strictly on this new stable period, excluding the explosive surge and the crash.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive stable regime continues: P28-P34 average is 105.3 units, firmly below pre-game history (114) and far below the surge.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 35 (demand 122, supply 117). We are in a stabilized post-explosive regime (Periods 28-35) with valid lead time of 0 periods (all recent orders arrived same-period). The demand average over the last 8 periods (P28-P35) is 107.4, slightly below the pre-game history of 114, but volatility is significant (range 80-122). The recent stockouts in P30 and P35 suggest the demand peaks (117, 122) are testing the buffer limits. I am selecting N=8 for both mu and sigma to capture the full extent of this new regime's volatility and average, ensuring the backend sees the recent 'lows' (80) and 'highs' (122) to calculate appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive regime volatility confirmed: P28-P35 avg (107.4) is stable, but high variance (range 80-122) is causing recurrent stockouts (P30, P35) as peaks return to pre-game levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 decision. Actual lead time remains reliably 0 periods (immediate delivery). The demand profile has stabilized into a post-explosive 'new normal' regime starting from Period 28. Using the most recent 9 periods (P28-P36) captures this stable behavior well: the average is 105.5 units with a standard deviation of 14.5. This average is significantly lower than the explosive regime (~215) and slightly below the pre-game history (~114). Recent volatility (range 80-122) caused stockouts in P30 and P35 when demand peaked near 120, suggesting that simple averaging needs a sufficient safety stock buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to encompass this entire post-crash recovery period. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as it matches observations perfectly.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 demand dropped to a historical low of 55, breaking the previous bounds of the post-explosive regime. However, high volatility persists (Period 35 had demand of 122), and the stockout cost is 4x holing cost. Reacting solely to the low of 55 risks stocking out if demand oscillates back up. I am therefore using a window of N=12 (covering the entire post-explosive period from P26 to P37) to calculate the mean (~99) and standard deviation. This provides a robust base stock level that cushions against the high variance while acknowledging the generally lower demand levels compared to the explosive peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: New historical record low demand (55) observed, widening the volatility range of the post-explosive regime to 55-122 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 stockout confirms continued high volatility (demand jump 55 -> 132). Current regime average (P29-P38) is ~102. Using N=10 for mu_hat to stabilize the baseline calculation around this new normal, while using N=5 for sigma_hat to remain sensitive to the recent rapid fluctuations (range 55-132). Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive regime volatility remains high: Period 38 spiked to 132 after Period 37's record low of 55, causing another stockout. The regime average (P29-P38) remains stable at ~102, but variance requires aggressive buffering.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 decision based on post-explosive volatility. Demand has been oscillating violently in the post-explosive regime (P28-P39), with a range of 55 to 132. The recent average (last 5 periods P35-P39) is 96.2, but the standard deviation is extremely high (~29.8) due to swings like 55 -> 132 -> 81. While the mean is stable around ~100-105, the volatility requires a larger safety stock to prevent the recurring stockouts seen in P30, P35, and P38. I will use 'recent_N=5' for both mu and sigma to capture this immediate high-variance 'sawtooth' pattern (low followed by high). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive saw-tooth pattern confirmed: Demand oscillates violently (e.g., P37: 55 -> P38: 132 -> P39: 81), keeping average stable (~96) but variance maximum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 concluded with yet another stockout, driven by a violent demand spike to 136 units immediately following a dip to 81. This confirms the 'saw-tooth' volatility pattern identified in recent carry-over insights: P37(55) -> P38(132) -> P39(81) -> P40(136). While the mean remains relatively stable around ~100-105 units (post-explosive regime), the standard deviation is extremely high due to these period-to-period oscillations. To address this, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to smooth the average but, critically, I will switch to a shorter window (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the recent explosion in variance (55 to 136 range). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High-frequency volatility pattern persists: Demand oscillates violently (81 -> 136) causing recurrent stockouts (P38, P40) despite stable average (~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is characterized by extreme volatility and repeated stockouts (P38, P40, P41). Demand in Period 41 hit 142, the highest recorded since the explosive regime ended. Crucially, the pattern has shifted from a simplified 'sawtooth' (High-Low-High-Low) to consecutive highs (136 in P40, 142 in P41), exacerbating stockout risks given the zero starting inventory. I am selecting recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the full extent of this volatility (ranging from 55 to 142). This approach generates a high standard deviation estimate (~39), producing a safety stock buffer capable of covering the recent peaks while acknowledging the low downside risks (e.g., P37's 55). Lead time remains reliable at 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand cluster detected: consecutive peaks in P40 (136) and P41 (142) broke the previous 'sawtooth' oscillation (High-Low-High), causing repeated stockouts. Volatility remains extreme (StdDev ~39 over last 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 Decision: The last 7 periods (P36-P42) show extreme volatility with a 'sawtooth' pattern (Demand: 91, 55, 132, 81, 136, 142, 79). The average over this volatile cluster is approx 102 units, but the standard deviation is massive (~31 units). Specifically, we see alternating high-low behavior, though P40-P41 broke this with two consecutive highs before P42 dropped back to 79. Given the high variance and recurrent stockouts (P38, P40, P41), relying on a long-term average (default) is risky because it smooths over these violent swings. The recent_N approach captures this local volatility better. I will use N=7 to encompass the entire post-P36 volatile cluster. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods (immediate arrival). With 63 units on hand, we need to order up to cover the potential for another spike (like P41's 142).

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility persists: P36-P42 shows a mean of ~102 but a range of 55-142, characterized by rapid oscillation. This regime requires high safety stock despite a moderate average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $479.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand (122) confirms the continuation of the high-volatility regime. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 112.0 units but fluctuated wildly between 79 and 142 (StdDev ~27 units). This 'sawtooth' pattern creates significant risk of stockouts (as seen in P40/P41). Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high cost of lost sales (4:1 profit-to-holding ratio) and low on-hand inventory (9 units), we maintain the 5-period window for both mean and volatility to capture these rapid oscillations and ensure sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime sustained: Post-explosive demand has stabilized in average (P39-P43 avg: 112.0) near historical norms, but variance remains extreme (range 79-142), requiring continued aggressive buffering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 decision. Demand continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a sawtooth-like oscillation pattern (P42:79 -> P43:122 -> P44:65). The last 5 periods range from 65 to 142, with a mean of ~109 and high standard deviation. A smaller window (N=3) would dangerously bias the forecast low due to recent dips (65, 79). Therefore, I maintain recent_N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture the high peaks (136, 142) included in that window, ensuring the base stock level (~138) is sufficient to cover potential spikes given the high cost of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility oscillation persists: Period 44 (65) followed Period 43 (122), maintaining the violently fluctuating regime (range 65-142) seen since Period 40. No sign of stabilization.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 46. We are in a high-volatility regime that began in Period 37, characterized by violent swings (range 55-142) but a stable mean around 100. Period 45 demand (91) was close to the mean, showing a slight dampening of the oscillation amplitude compared to earlier spikes, but the risk of stockout remains high due to previous peaks (136, 142). The average of the last 9 periods (P37-P45) is 100.3 with a standard deviation of ~33. I will apply 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this entire specific volatility cluster, ensuring the backend's base stock calculation accounts for both the mean (~100) and the significant variance (StdDev ~33) to protect the 80% service level target (implied by 4/5 profit ratio). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime persists (P37-P45): Mean stabilized at 100.3 units, but variance remains high (StdDev ~33) with a range of 55-142 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $501.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 decision. Current Context: Demand in Period 46 was 126, which is relatively high within the current volatile regime. The 'sawtooth' pattern of oscillating demand (high-low-high) continues, though P46 (126) followed P45 (91) and P44 (65), suggesting a potential upward cluster or simply high variance. The 5-period average (P42-P46) is ~96.6, but the standard deviation is extremely high (~28) with a range of 65-142. Lead time remains consistently 0. 

Strategy: Given the extreme volatility and recent stockouts (P38, P40, P41), relying on a simple average is risky. The 10-period average (P37-P46) captures the full extent of this volatile erratic regime better than a short window which might overreact to a single dip. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to smooth out the noise while maintaining a robust base level (~102). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 as well to capture the full volatility range (StdDev ~31 over last 10) rather than dampening it. This helps defend against the sudden spikes (e.g., 142) that cause stockouts.

Carry-over insight: High volatility erratic regime continues: P37-P46 avg ~103, but StdDev is ~31 with range 55-142. No sign of stabilization.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48/50. The high volatility 'sawtooth' regime persists, with demand oscillating violently between lows (~65-80) and highs (~125-140) over the best recent window. Period 47 (82) was a dip following a high in Period 46 (126). Given the cost of stockouts ($4) vs holding ($1), and the consistent pattern of rapid oscillation, we must maintain safety stock to cover the upper end of the volatility range rather than reacting to the most recent low. A window of N=10 (P38-P47) captures a representative sample of this erratic regime (averaging ~105 with high variance) better than a shorter window which might be biased by the latest dip. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: High volatility oscillation persists: Period 47 (82) confirms the 'sawtooth' pattern (Low-High-Low) continues. The 10-period regime (P38-P47) averages 105.6 units but requires buffering for peaks up to 142.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49/50. Demand volatility remains the primary challenge, with the last 10 periods showing a wide range (65-142) and a mean of ~99.1 units. Although recent demand (P47: 82, P48: 67) has been low, the history of sudden spikes (P46: 126, P41: 142) makes a short memory window (like N=3 or N=5) risky as it would underestimate the necessary base stock. We select a 10-period window for both expected demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full recent amplitude of the oscillation. With L=0 confirmed, we target a service level of ~80% (profit 4 vs holding 1) to maximize capture of potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Erratic volatility persists: Period 48 (67) continues the lower-end swing, maintaining the wide 55-142 range established since Period 37 without clear stabilization.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). The post-explosive demand regime (since roughly Period 37) persists with a 'sawtooth' high-volatility pattern. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), demand has averaged 102.0 units with a high standard deviation (approx 27.3), fluctuating between 65 and 142. To maximize profit (high margin $4 vs holding $1), we maintain a robust safety stock. We select 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mean and sigma to capture the full recent volatility range, including the spikes in P40-P41, ensuring adequate coverage for the next potential upswing.

Carry-over insight: Post-explosive erratic regime stable: P40-P49 average (102.0) and StdDev (~27.3) characterize the current state, with demand consistently oscillating between ~65 and ~142. No directional drift detected, only high variance.
