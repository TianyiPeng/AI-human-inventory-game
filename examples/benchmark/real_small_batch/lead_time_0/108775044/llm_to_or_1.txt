Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean = 134 units/week and moderate variability (sample std \u2248 19). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, no concluded arrivals observed so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and there are no concluded lead-time observations to suggest changing it, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine anchored to the recent historical average demand while avoiding premature adjustments for lead time or volatility changes given the limited 5-sample history. With on-hand and pipeline at zero, this policy will prompt orders to restore stock toward the base stock implied by the observed demand and the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded history shows the Period 1 order (ordered P1) arrived in P1 with lead_time=0, matching the promised 0-period lead time. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 at decision time, but previous ordered stock arrived same period, indicating no confirmed delays. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u2248134 units/week and moderate variability (~17 units). With promised lead time = 0 and no sustained changepoint in demand or lead time (only one concluded lead-time observation), I use the defaults so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std. This keeps the (1+L) coverage equal to one week of demand, balances service level given profit/holding costs, and avoids overreacting to a single-period observation. If future conclude messages show delays or a demand shift, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit estimate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived with lead_time=0 (two observed lead_time=0 samples). Demand history: weekly samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04 = [162,142,115,133,118], plus concluded period demands 2019-02-11=157 and 2019-02-18=244. Recent demand appears higher than the older Jan baseline (last two weeks 157 and 244), but this is only a 2-period elevation so not yet a sustained regime change. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (observed evidence supports 0), and bias the demand forecast toward the recent window to capture the uptick while avoiding overreacting to only two high points. I choose mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 samples: 2019-01-21..2019-02-18 mean \u2248153.4, scaled by (1+L)=1) so the base-stock reflects the short-term increase. Sigma_hat is left as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility to the last two high weeks. This balances service level (reduce stockouts given recent spike) against holding cost by not fully shifting to the extreme recent week (244) alone. No overdue or missing shipments detected (arrivals matched orders in concluded periods).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4 (Period 4). Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated: Period1=157, Period2=244, Period3=175. On-hand=16, in-transit=0, and there are no concluded late arrivals to investigate (no overdue shipments). Observed lead times in concluded history are 0 periods (orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived same period), so I set L using the observed average. Demand appears to have shifted upward and this is sustained for 3 periods, so I use a recent_N forecast over the last 3 demand observations to capture the new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given elevated demand, while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability so the cap will limit extreme over-ordering and balance holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: historical mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) = 134; recent Periods 1-3 mean = 192 (+43%), sustained 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $514.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 in Periods 1\u20134 (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand = 82, in-transit = 0. Demand has shifted up compared to the older historical sample set: recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20134 conclude) = [157, 244, 175, 149] with a sustained higher regime identified starting Period 1. To avoid stockouts given no in-transit cover and higher recent demand, I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (recent_N) to reflect the elevated mean and volatility. I choose N=3 (regime length = 3 recent periods of elevated demand met the threshold; N is set to max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 3) to focus the estimate on the most recent confirmed high-demand periods while avoiding overfitting to a single week spike. This increases base_stock and the backend will compute a higher reorder target to balance lost-sales profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1). Sigma uses recent_N=3 to reflect the higher recent variability and raise safety stock accordingly.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded demand (Periods 3-5) = [175, 149, 138], mean = 154 units; historical sample mean (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) = 134 units. Recent mean is about +15% vs historical, indicating a modest upward shift but not a large sudden spike. On-hand = 93, in-transit = 0, so available inventory covers ~0.6 of a recent-week demand (93 / 154). No overdue or lost shipments observed\u2014all prior orders (P1\u2013P5) concluded with lead_time = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history confirms 0, so use the promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent upward demand regime while being robust to noise, I use a recent_N approach for demand mean and volatility with N=3 (Periods 3-5). This focuses the OR backend on the most relevant recent demand behavior ((1+L) factor is applied by backend). Using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock target relative to historical default to improve service (reduce stockouts) while the capped ordering policy will limit excessive ordering to control holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-6) = [149, 138, 156], mean \u2248 147.7 units/week. Earlier periods showed higher volatility (Period2 spike 244), but the last 3 periods form a stable lower regime around ~148. I will keep promised lead time (observed lead times have been 0 consistently) and base demand forecasts on the most recent 3 periods to reflect the current regime. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the current demand level and variability, improving service while avoiding excess holding cost given low on-hand. This setup addresses missing shipments risk (none observed) and ensures orders target covering the next review+lead period of demand (L=0) with variability captured by recent sigma estimate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent observed demand (Periods 1-7) is elevated relative to the older historical Jan samples: demands = [157,244,175,149,138,156,182], on-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u20137 show lead_time=0, so promised lead time appears reliable. Profit $4 / holding $1 implies a high service quantile (q=0.8) so OR should target higher fill rates to avoid lost sales. I therefore keep L as default (use promised lead time = 0) and set demand estimates using the recent data since a sustained higher-demand regime is present from Period 1 onward\u2014use recent_N with N=7 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full recent regime (Periods 1\u20137). This increases target base-stock to protect service level while sigma estimated from recent variability captures uncertainty and keeps cap from producing excessively large single orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1\u2013P7 all arrived same period)

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no cover for imminent demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived same period), so using promised lead time=0 is appropriate. Recent demand has shifted up vs. the older 2019-Jan baseline; the most recent five concluded demands (Periods 4\u20138 = 149,138,156,182,312) have mean \u2248187.4 and show elevated and more variable demand (one large spike at Period 8). To balance service level (profit $4/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) I use a short lookback to capture the new regime while avoiding overreacting to a single outlier: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean based on the latest regime. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so the backend inflates safety stock appropriately for the observed variability. L remains default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. These choices ensure orders target the current higher demand regime while keeping holding cost in check given confirmed zero lead time and no pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: mean demand over Periods 1\u20139 \u2248 191 units/week (sum 1720 over 9 periods). On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0, so current inventory is well below a single-week demand in this new regime. All concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u20139 show lead time = 0, so promised lead time=0 remains accurate. I choose L='default' (use promised 0) because concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals. For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the OR backend to the sustained higher-demand regime (N=9 equals the observed recent regime length). This ensures base_stock = (1+L)\xd7recent mean and uses recent volatility to set safety stock; with profit=4 and holding=1 the engine will compute an appropriate service-level z. Using recent data avoids diluting the current high-demand signal with older low-demand samples and reduces stockouts given on-hand=41 and no pipeline. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time slips to account for beyond the confirmed L=0.

Recent demand has risen materially versus the Jan baseline: the last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 6\u201310 = 156, 182, 312, 207, 225) average ~216 units/wk, well above the historical mean (~134). On-hand = 14, in-transit = 0, so immediate coverage is very low and we should target higher replenishment. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders placed P1\u2013P10 all arrived same period), so I use the default promised lead time to let the OR engine assume 0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding overfitting to a single spike, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (Periods 6\u201310). This gives the backend a (1+L)-scaled mean based on the recent regime and a recent volatility estimate so the computed base-stock raises service level appropriately while the capped order limit prevents extreme single-period orders. This balances the high profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1) by increasing target stock to reduce stockouts but still constraining order size via the backend cap.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 each concluded period) and elevated demand versus the early historical baseline. I therefore keep L as the promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For demand I use a recent_N mu_hat with N=11 (all observed periods 1\u201311) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime visible across the full recent history (notably multiple weeks with demand >> the earlier Jan baseline). This raises the base-stock target so the OR backend replenishes to meet the higher demand and avoid lost sales. For sigma_hat I use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to reflect observed variability across the full sample set. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit $4 > holding $1) by increasing the forecasted demand while using the backend's capped order to limit excessive inventory and holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated vs the small-sample historical baseline: the last several periods (P6\u2013P12) show consistently high demand (range ~156\u2013312, recent cluster around ~200\u2013270). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover; promised lead time is 0 and previous concluded history confirms same-period arrivals through P12, so no overdue/lost shipments to account for. I select L=default to respect the promised lead time (and confirmed 0 actual lead time). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 7 periods (P6\u2013P12) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively \u2014 7 gives a balance between responsiveness and sample stability given a clear sustained uptick. These choices push the OR backend to raise the base-stock toward the recent demand level (improving service and capturing profit of $4/unit) while sigma_hat from the same recent window moderates safety stock to limit excess holding cost ($1/unit/period).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand = 80, in-transit = 0. Historical baseline (early Jan samples) mean = 134, but demand has clearly increased in recent weeks: Periods 9\u201313 demands = [207,225,273,270,199], recent mean \u2248 234.8 and elevated variance. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history. Because the recent regime (higher demand) is sustained over the last 5 weeks, I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the higher realized demand while keeping L as the promised/confirmed 0. This balances higher service level (to capture profit $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit by using a short N to react to the confirmed upward regime; sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect increased variability. No in-transit units to cover current period demand, so higher mu_hat reduces immediate stockout risk.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 10\u201314 = 225, 273, 270, 199, 266) is substantially above the older baseline (mean \u2248134); recent 5-period mean \u2248246.6, a sustained higher-demand regime. To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) so the OR engine targets a base-stock tuned to the elevated recent mean and its short-run variability. L is left as default (promised 0) because concluded arrival history confirms same-period delivery. This choice ensures the backend raises the target stock to cover the higher recent demand while sigma estimated from recent data prevents overstocking from older quieter periods. No overdue shipments are outstanding (no in-transit), so no explicit lead-time extension is applied.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Past concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and a sustained higher-demand regime in recent weeks. Recent demand (Periods 10\u201315): [225, 273, 270, 199, 266, 267], mean = 250 units/week \u2014 materially above the long-run mean. With lead time confirmed as 0, orders arrive same period so the OR should size base stock to cover the immediate demand regime. I choose L=default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 periods; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to anchor the forecast to the recent high-demand regime (captures the elevated mean of ~250 over the last 6 periods); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than diluted long-run variability. This combination raises the base-stock to meet current demand and avoids frequent stockouts while keeping holding cost in check by using a modest N (6) rather than all historical data. Given on-hand=8 and no pipeline, this policy will trigger orders to restore stock toward the recent demand-driven base-stock level, improving service with controlled inventory holding.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Current on-hand = 13, in-transit = 0. Recent concluded history (Periods 9\u201316) shows consistently higher weekly demand (~200\u2013275) versus the early-Jan baseline (mean 134). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost, I target a demand estimate based on the most recent stable high-demand regime (last 8 weeks: Periods 9\u201316 mean \u2248 246 units). With promised lead time = 0 and observed consistent same-period arrivals, I keep L as default (promised). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect the current elevated demand regime so the base stock will cover the immediate (1+L) period demand at that higher mean. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=8 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices increase service level to match sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock and holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=61, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods. Recent demand (Periods 8\u201317 and earlier) is substantially higher than the small Jan sample; the elevated regime has persisted for many weeks so I use recent data to set demand forecast and volatility. I choose L=default to trust the confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (the last 10 demand observations) to capture the current regime while smoothing short spikes. This ensures the backend's base-stock reflects current higher mean demand across the review+lead period and that sigma reflects recent variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given zero LT) against holding cost (we keep on-hand moderate since holding cost is non-trivial). No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand = 189, in-transit = 0. Recent concluded history (Periods 9\u201318) shows consistently higher weekly demand (many weeks ~200\u2013275) compared with the early-Jan samples (mean=134). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. No shipments are overdue. To keep the OR engine focused on the recent, higher-demand regime while respecting the confirmed short lead time, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 demand observations (captures the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-week noise). Choosing N=10 balances using enough data for stable estimates while responding to the regime shift evident across many periods. This will raise the base-stock target to meet service levels appropriate for the higher demand, while sigma_hat from the same recent window informs safety stock so the OR backend can trade off profit (higher fill) versus holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent realized weekly demand has been higher than the Jan baseline: the last 8 concluded demands (P12\u2013P19) average ~207 units/week with notable variability (range 85\u2013270). On-hand = 190, in-transit = 0, so current stock is roughly one week of recent demand but below the recent mean. Historical game messages (Periods 1\u201319 conclude) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). To keep service while limiting holding cost, I use the confirmed lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent regime (last 8 weeks) where demand stabilized at a higher mean. Therefore: L = default to use promised/confirmed lead time (0). mu_hat = recent_N with N=8 so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 samples (captures the elevated recent mean ~207). sigma_hat = recent_N with N=8 so the engine uses recent volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 8 samples) to size safety stock. This choice balances service (match recent higher demand) and holding cost (avoid using long-run low baseline), and explicitly accounts for zero lead time so orders can correct inventory within the same period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent observed demand has fallen sharply: Periods 18-20 demands = [92, 85, 61]. On-hand = 212, in-transit = 0, and historical concluded lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). Given high on-hand relative to the new lower demand regime, we should reduce the forecast used by the OR engine to avoid excess holding cost. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand, I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 18-20) so mu_hat reflects the new low-volume regime and reduces ordering; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to lower safety stock since volatility has decreased in the last 3 periods. These choices balance service level (short lead time, still keep some buffer) against holding cost by shrinking the base_stock toward current realized demand while respecting the OR backend's capped policy.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=185, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (orders placed P1\u2013P21 all concluded with W=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has a clear regime drop starting Period 18: Periods 18\u201320 mean = 79 (92,85,61) and Period 21 = 27, giving very low recent demand. I therefore bias demand estimates toward the recent low-demand regime rather than the long-run historical mean. Chosen methods: L=default (use promised 0). mu_hat: recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent 4 periods (Periods 18\u201321) where demand averaged \u224866.25, reflecting the sustained low regime; this prevents over-ordering. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=4 to reflect reduced recent variability and keep safety stock conservative. These parameters keep base-stock aligned with current low demand and zero lead time, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the new lower demand level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 18: Periods 18-22 demands = [92,85,61,27,21] with much lower mean/volatility than earlier periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (orders placed P1\u2013P20 all arrived same period). Current inventory: on-hand=164, in-transit=0; with the lower demand regime we do not need large replenishment. To reflect the confirmed short lead time and the new low-demand regime I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) so the OR engine knows arrivals are same-period as promised. For demand forecasting I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (use the last 5 periods in the low-demand regime: Periods 18\u201322) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the most relevant data. This reduces target base-stock and safety stock, lowering holding costs while keeping adequate service for the new lower demand level. The choices account for zero in-transit and substantial on-hand, avoiding over-ordering into a lower-demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Current on-hand=145, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply and stabilized: Periods 21-23 demands = 27, 21, 19 (avg ~22). Lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals; promised L=0 remains appropriate. Given the clear regime shift downward starting Period 18 and 3+ periods of very low demand (Periods 21-23), I bias forecasts to the recent low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost. Therefore: set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat use recent_N (N=3) so the OR engine builds base_stock from the most recent low average ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3). For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the lower volatility observed in the last three periods. This keeps orders conservative (low mean and low safety stock) to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost and prevents overstock given current slow sales and zero in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-55.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has fallen sharply: Periods 18-20 averaged 79 units/week, then Periods 21-24 dropped to ~21 units/week. On-hand = 127, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times are all 0, so no hidden delay signal. Given the clear, sustained drop starting Period 21, I use a short (0) lead-time estimate and compute demand parameters from the most recent low-demand regime so the OR engine will reduce orders and avoid holding costs. Specifically: L set by calculate (observed lead times average 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect the new low-demand regime (Periods 21-24). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to capture reduced volatility in the new regime. These choices lower the base stock (mu_hat) and reduce safety stock (sigma_hat), which helps trade off service level vs holding cost given the sustained decline in demand and the current ample on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg decreased from 79 (Periods 18-20) to 21.25 (Periods 21-24), -73%, sustained 4 periods

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21: Periods 21-25 demands = [27,21,19,18,27], recent mean = 22.4 units/week. All concluded history (Periods 1-25) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period), and there are currently no in-transit units. On-hand = 100 units, which is ~4.5\xd7 the recent weekly demand; with promised lead time 0 and high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1) we still should avoid fresh receipts because holding costs will erode reward. Therefore: set L = default (use promised lead time 0). For demand forecast use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21 (regime length = 5). Use the same recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current reduced volatility. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to the new low-demand level and lower the ordering target so the large on-hand balance is drawn down before replenishing, reducing holding cost while preserving service level under the current low-demand regime. No evidence of lost shipments; in-transit = 0 and prior arrivals confirm lead time 0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand for SKU 108775044 has been in the low regime since Period 18 with a clear sustained decline starting Period 21 (weeks 21\u201326 show low weekly demand: 27,21,19,18,27,16). On-hand = 84, in-transit = 0 and there have been no new orders placed since Period 20 (orders=0 P21\u2013P26) but past concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (arrivals always same period). Given the sustained low-demand regime (at least 6 recent periods, stable), I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N over the most recent 6 demand samples (Periods 21\u201326) so the OR engine targets (1+L)*mean of the current low-demand regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect current lower volatility. This combination reduces order quantities relative to historical highs, limiting holding cost while preserving service for the currently observed low-demand regime. Using recent_N prevents the backend from being pulled up by older high-demand weeks and addresses the lack of in-transit inventory (no overdue arrivals to expect).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Current on-hand = 72, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time = 0 for all observed arrivals (Periods 1\u201320). From Period 21 onward the system has placed no orders (ordered=0, arrived=0) while demand fell sharply and then stabilized at a low level (Period 21\u201327 demands = 27,21,19,18,27,16,12). There is no concluded evidence of increased lead time or in-transit shipments; missing arrivals are due to no orders being placed rather than delayed shipments. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms lead time = 0 and there is no evidence to change it. Demand regime has clearly shifted down starting Period 21 and is sustained for 7 periods (Periods 21\u201327); to reflect the new lower mean and lower variability I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (regime length = 7). This makes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 demand samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 7 samples, so the OR backend will size the base stock to the recent low-demand regime and shrink safety stock accordingly. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, reducing target stock limits unnecessary holding cost while preserving service for the lower-demand regime. The parameters also account for zero in-transit inventory (no pipeline) so the OR engine will calculate an order only to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the recent-regime base stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 21: recent weekly demand (Periods 21\u201328) is consistently low (range 11\u201327, avg \u2248 19\u201321). On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0; lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period). Given the sustained low-demand regime (8 consecutive low-demand periods) I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (the recent low-demand regime length) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 8 demand samples \u2014 this keeps target base-stock aligned to the much lower current demand and avoids excess holding cost. This approach balances service level (use recent demand stats to meet current low weekly demand) against holding cost (reduces base-stock compared to using older high-demand data). No evidence of new lead-time issues or lost shipments in concluded history, so no lead-time adjustment.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (weekly demand: 27,21,19,18,27,16,12,11,7). On-hand = 54, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0, so I keep L = default (0). Demand regime: a sustained drop beginning Period 21 (9 periods of low demand) justifies using a recent-sample forecast. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 (covers Periods 21\u201329) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_last_9 \u2248 1*17.56 per period aggregated across review+lead. Sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=9 to capture current low-regime volatility. This keeps base-stock and cap small to avoid excess holding cost given high holding ($1) vs profit ($4) and the clear sustained demand decline. No evidence of lost shipments (arrivals historically matched orders when placed), so no upward bias to cover delayed arrivals is needed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand for 108775044 has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (weekly demand mostly between ~6\u201327 units); the last 10 observed demands (Periods 21\u201330) average 16.4 units. On-hand = 48, in-transit = 0 \u2014 current inventory already covers multiple weeks of the current low-demand regime. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) through Period 20 and earlier, so there is no evidence of a longer or unreliable lead time. To avoid overstocking given a high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), I set lead time to the promised/default and use a recent_N forecast that targets the current low-demand regime: mu_hat uses the last 10 periods (the recent, sustained low-demand regime) so the OR engine computes a base-stock appropriate for current demand; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This keeps service high for current demand while limiting excess holding cost by not inflating the forecast with older, higher-demand periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows lead time reliably 0 (orders P1\u2013P31 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 18 with further step-downs recorded through Period 25; recent weeks (Periods 21\u201331) show consistently low weekly demand (27,21,19,18,27,16,12,11,7,6,4). I will keep lead time at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand parameters I use a recent-window estimate anchored to the low-demand regime that began at Period 21 \u2014 this captures the sustained lower mean/variance and avoids over-ordering from older high-demand history. The regime length from Period 21 to Period 31 is 11 periods, so I choose recent_N with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This makes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 11 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 11 samples) when the backend computes. This approach reduces stockbuilding risk (lower mean) while keeping safety for observed variability in the low-demand regime. No in-transit units and on-hand=44 already cover several weeks of current demand, so shrinking forecast to recent regime helps balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Demand context: historical series shows a sustained, large downward shift beginning Period 18 with further drop at Period 21; recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 21\u201332). On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0; no incoming arrivals expected (previous orders from Periods 21+ were 0). Lead time: past concluded messages consistently show same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) so use promised/default. Demand forecasting: a low-demand regime has persisted from Period 21 through Period 32 (12 periods). To capture the current low mean and recent variability, use recent_N over the last 12 demand observations (Periods 21\u201332). This keeps mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the sustained low-demand regime, reducing target base stock and holding cost while preserving service for current demand. These parameter choices help the OR backend compute a smaller base stock (reducing holding cost exposure) while reflecting the confirmed low-demand regime and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21: average demand from Periods 21\u201333 \u2248 13.4 units/week (13 periods). On-hand = 38, in-transit = 0 \u2014 current inventory covers roughly 2.9 weeks at this demand rate. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. I therefore keep lead time at the promised value and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Choices: L=default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded arrivals show 0-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=13 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the sustained low-demand regime (N chosen = length of the current regime, 13); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=13 to capture recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk by aligning the base-stock with the new low mean while keeping enough coverage for ~ (1+L) demand; low sigma reduces safety stock since demand variability is low, which balances service level against holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Current on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical conclude history and previous carry-over insights confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained down-shift in demand beginning Period 18 with further reduction at Period 21 and Period 25; recent weekly demand has been low (periods 21\u201334: values mostly in the single- to low-double digits). Given confirmed same-period arrivals historically and promised lead time=0, I use the default lead time so the OR engine uses the promised lead time. For demand forecast I focus on the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201334). I choose recent_N for mu_hat using N=14 (regime_length = 14 weeks from Period 21\u201334) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the last 14 samples and captures the lower current demand level. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N with N=14 to reflect volatility within the same recent regime. This keeps base-stock and cap tight to avoid excess holding cost given low demand and substantial on-hand inventory (31 units) while maintaining service, leveraging the confirmed lead time=0 to allow same-period replenishment if demand picks up.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show lead time repeatedly observed as 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P17 all arrived same period), and demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (sustained low weekly sales ~3\u201327). No recent arrivals are pending, so pipeline = 0 and there are no overdue shipments to reconcile. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because multiple concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained low-demand regime that began at Period 21 (Periods 21\u201335 = 15 samples). Using the recent 15 weeks prevents the OR engine from restocking to the much higher historical peaks and reduces holding cost given the low current demand; matching sigma to the same recent window ensures safety stock reflects current low variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts for small ongoing demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (demands per week mostly between 3\u201327, trending ~10\u201315 recently) and on-hand = 23, in-transit = 0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201336) confirm actual lead time = 0. Given the sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21 (regime length = 16 periods up to Period 36), I use the promised/confirmed lead time (default L=0) and base the demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 16 samples to capture the new lower mean and reduced variance. This choice keeps mu_hat responsive to the persistent drop (avoids over-ordering) while sigma_hat from recent data captures current demand variability so the OR backend sets an appropriately low base stock and cap, balancing service level against holding cost with minimal extra inventory given holding cost = $1/unit/period and profit = $4/unit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Demand has been in a low, stable regime since Period 21 (weekly demand mostly single- to low-double digits). On-hand = 20, in-transit = 0 \u2014 current inventory covers ~1.7\u20136+ weeks of recent demand depending on week, so aggressive replenishment is unnecessary. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period). I therefore keep L = default (promised lead time). For demand, I detect a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 21 (length = 17 periods to date); I use recent_N with N=17 so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent low-demand regime rather than the much larger historical mean. Volatility has likewise compressed in the same recent window, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=17 to reflect the lower std. These settings reduce target base-stock and cap order size, lowering holding cost while maintaining adequate service for the confirmed low-demand regime and same-period lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 with a further prolonged low tail from Period 25 onward. Current on-hand = 12, in-transit = 0; no arrivals expected (no recent orders placed). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed in Periods 1\u201317 arrived same period). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 25\u201338, 14 samples) averages ~8.2 units/week with modest volatility (std \u2248 6.4). Given the confirmed zero lead time and the clear, sustained low-demand regime, I choose a short-horizon estimate that focuses the backend on the most recent 14-week regime to avoid overstocking. This keeps base stock small (reducing holding cost) while still covering expected near-term demand. Methods chosen: L uses the promised/default lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=14 to anchor the order-up-to calculation to the current low-demand regime and its observed volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand history shows an earlier high-demand regime (Periods 1\u201317) then a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 18 and confirmed through Period 39 (see carry-over: drop to avg ~21.25 by Periods 21\u201324 and low values thereafter). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded messages (orders placed P1\u2013P39 that arrived show 0 periods). Current on-hand=10, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has been low (single- to double-digit) for many periods, so we should target a low review+lead demand forecast to avoid holding cost. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 21\u201339 form the current low-demand regime; regime length=19, capped rules give N=19) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the recent low-demand samples. This biases the base-stock toward the low-demand regime, reducing overstock/holding cost while preserving service given observed low demand and immediate replenishment. No evidence of new changepoint or lost shipments in the last concluded period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (weekly sales mostly single digits through Periods 21\u201340). On-hand = 14, in-transit = 0 so no incoming arrivals expected; inventory covers only a short number of weeks at current demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To align the OR engine with the current low-demand regime I use the promised/default lead time and estimate demand parameters from the recent low-demand regime. Specifically: L='default' (promised 0), mu_hat='recent_N' using the most recent 20 periods to capture the sustained low-demand mean across Periods 21\u201340, and sigma_hat='recent_N' with the same N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match current low demand (limiting overstock and holding cost) while still providing service against weekly demand variability. I flagged that there are no in-transit units and we should expect no arrivals next period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier); no new lead-time evidence\u2014use promised lead time. Demand experienced major declines mid-year and has remained in a low, stable regime for many periods (Periods ~25\u201341). I detect the most recent low-demand regime covering the last 13 concluded periods (Periods 29\u201341) with consistently small weekly demand (values mostly between 3 and 8). To keep the OR backend responsive to the current low-demand regime while still accounting for short-term variability, I use recent_N with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility are driven by the most recent low-demand observations. This reduces overstock risk versus using the long-run mean and balances service level (using z from profit/holding) against holding costs given current low demand and zero lead time. No overdue shipments are observed (arrivals have matched orders in recent conclues).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Current on-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (many periods of single- or low-double-digit weekly demand; recent weeks: P39\u2013P42 demands = 4,4,3,10). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period). No overdue shipments visible. Given the persistent low-demand regime (long duration >20 periods), I use a recent-sample forecast to capture current lower mean and reduced volatility rather than the long-run historical mean which is dominated by earlier high-demand periods. Choices: L = default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat = recent_N with N=20 to set the (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the current low-demand regime and reduces risk of overstock); sigma_hat = recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent lower variability. This keeps base-stock small to limit holding cost (holding $1/unit/period) while allowing the OR backend to compute a service-level consistent z* from profit/(profit+holding). Recent_N inputs reduce overstating demand and help avoid large ending inventory given low current demand and non-negligible holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (weekly demand mostly in the single digits). On-hand=13, in-transit=0; given current weekly demand (~2\u201310 last five weeks) on-hand covers multiple weeks so I will avoid inflating inventory. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (many periods with orders arriving same period), so use default (promised) lead time. To capture the long-lived low-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent stable regime while respecting the N selection rule). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps forecasts and volatility tied to the current low-demand regime and helps the OR backend compute a smaller base stock (reducing holding cost while maintaining service).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been very low compared with early-year levels: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 39\u201344) = [4,4,3,10,2,4], mean \u2248 4.5 units/week. On-hand = 10, in-transit = 0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (carry-over evidence). Given the sustained low-demand regime for many weeks and small sample variance, I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows same-period arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent regime (captures current low demand ~4\u20135/week). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent low volatility rather than the much larger historical volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match the low current demand and avoid excess holding cost while keeping a high service level (profit/hc implies high target fill rate). With on-hand=10 and expected weekly demand \u22484.5, this should keep inventory near one to two weeks of cover and limit holding cost drag.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand has been in a low, stable regime for many periods (weekly demands mostly single- to low-double digits since Period 21). On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P45 that concluded arrived same period). Given the long, sustained drop in demand vs earlier higher-volume periods, I reduce the demand forecast to reflect the recent low-demand regime. I choose L = default so the OR engine uses the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; this avoids inflating pipeline coverage. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent observations and avoid carrying excess inventory. This helps the OR backend lower base-stock and cap calculations to reduce holding cost while still aiming for a high service level (profit/ (profit+holding) = 0.8 implies high z*). With on-hand=3 and no in-transit, the smaller recent mean/std should keep orders conservative and prevent large ending inventory build-up over the holiday/low season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: avg decreased from 21.25 (Periods 21-24) to 4.86 (Periods 39-45), \u221277%, sustained 7 periods

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical series shows a prolonged low-demand regime since Period 39 (recent demands: P39\u2013P46 = [4,4,3,10,2,4,7,11], mean \u22485.63). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. There is no confirmed new sustained demand shift (P46 spike to 11 is a one-period uptick). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows same-period arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current low-demand regime including the most recent variability; mu_hat will therefore be (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples and sigma_hat will use recent_N N=8 (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 8). This keeps base-stock low to limit holding cost while allowing the OR backend to provide some buffer for observed volatility (the capped order will further limit over-ordering). Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, this configuration balances a modest service level with tight inventory to avoid excessive holding cost when demand is low and stable.
