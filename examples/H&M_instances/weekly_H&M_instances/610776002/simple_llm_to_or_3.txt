======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis (Periods -5 to -1) shows a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308. This represents a growth from an average of ~160 in the first three periods to over 300 in the most recent observation, suggesting a transition into a higher demand regime. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal relevance as the Northern Hemisphere moves from mid-February into Spring. Given the strong momentum and the transition into mid-February (a typical period for Spring collection interest), a further increase is projected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed leading into Period 1: significant upward trend with demand increasing from ~150 to 300+ in the last 5 periods (+100% growth).

Predicted demand: 345 units

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend, culminating in 308 units in the last training period. The actual demand for Period 1 was 266 units, which is slightly lower than the training peak but confirms the 'carry-over insight' of a sustained high-demand regime compared to the early training average of ~150. Given the product is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt and the date is February 18, we are moving further into the spring pre-season where demand for basics typically stabilizes or grows. The drop from 308 (training end) to 266 (Period 1) suggests a stabilization or slight cooling of the initial spike, but the overall level remains high. I predict slightly rejuvenated demand as we approach late February.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU showed an initial range of 148-233, ending with a peak of 308. In the current test phase, Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316) confirm the Carry-over Insight of a sustained upward trend and a higher demand regime (averaging ~291 recently). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees increasing demand as spring approaches in late February. Given the sequential increase from 266 to 316 and the historical momentum, the forecast for February 25th anticipates a continuation of this growth or a stabilization at the new high-demand level. I will project a slight further increase based on the established trend line.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trajectory, moving from 148 to 308. This shift has persisted into the test phase. Observations for Periods 1-3 show demand levels of 266, 316, and 306, establishing a new stable demand regime with an average of approximately 296 units. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically sees increasing demand as the Northern Hemisphere moves from late winter into early spring (March). Given the current date is March 4th and the recent trend has stabilized above 300, I expect demand to remain strong or slightly increase due to seasonal momentum. The slight dip from 316 to 306 is treated as minor variance within the new high-demand regime.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an upward trajectory (148 to 308). The observed test demand (Periods 1-4) confirms a new stabilized regime averaging 292.75 units, significantly higher than the training start. During this time of year (early Match), demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts typically remains stable or begins a slight climb as spring approaches in several markets. Recent demand has shown a slight cooling from the Period 2 peak of 316 down to 283 in Period 4. I expect the demand to stabilize around the current 4-week mean while anticipating the start of a seasonal spring uplift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an initial climb from 148 to 308. In the test phase (Periods 1-5), the demand peaked at 316 in Period 2 and has since shown a steady decline over four consecutive periods (316 -> 306 -> 283 -> 252), representing a ~20% drop from the peak. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring progresses, but the recent weekly trend is clearly downward. Period 6 (March 18) follows this cooling trend. Given the consistent weekly decreases of ~10-30 units, a continued moderate decline is expected before the full spring/summer surge typically seen in April/May.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed since Period 2: demand decreased from 316 to 252 over 4 periods (~20% decline).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data showed a peak in Period 2 (316), followed by a three-period decline ending in Period 5 (252). Period 6 (270) broke this downward trend with a modest 7% increase. Given the product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt and the current date is late March, demand is likely to stabilize or show slight seasonal growth as spring weather begins. The mean of the last three periods is approximately 268. An estimate of 274 accounts for the stabilization observed in the most recent period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt showed a decline from Period 2 (316) through Period 5 (252). However, recent performance shows a sharp reversal. Period 6 saw a slight recovery to 270, and Period 7 experienced a significant spike to 364 units (a 35% increase from Period 6). This surge corresponds with the end of March/beginning of April, likely driven by seasonal demand as customers transition into Spring wardrobes. Given the strong momentum from Period 7 and the product's relevance as a lightweight layering piece for the current calendar date (April 1st), I anticipate the demand will remain elevated, though slightly moderating after the initial surge.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows an initial decline from Period 2 (316) to Period 5 (252), followed by a significant regime shift starting in Period 7. Demand jumped from 270 in Period 6 to 364 in Period 7 (+35%) and 372 in Period 8. This spike aligns with the product being a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' in early April, correlating with the onset of the Spring/Summer retail season and warmer weather. Given the strong upward momentum and high demand in the most recent two periods (avg 368), I expect demand to remain elevated but stabilize slightly as the initial seasonal surge levels off.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward shift starting Period 7: demand baseline increased from ~280 to ~370 (+32%) coinciding with Spring seasonal demand for basics.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this basic jersey T-shirt shows a recent supply/demand spike in Period 7 (364) and Period 8 (372), followed by a notable drop to 271 in Period 9. While the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 9 suggested a sustained upward shift based on periods 7 and 8, the sharp drop in Period 9 (returning to the Period 1-6 baseline of ~282) suggests the previous two weeks may have been an isolated peak (possibly a mid-season promotion or specific spring transition peak) rather than a new permanent regime. Given the date is mid-April, demand for 'Everyday Basics' typically stabilizes or grows slightly as weather warms. Taking a weighted approach that respects the recent drop while acknowledging the slightly higher average of the last 3 periods (335) compared to the first 6 periods (282), I expect a moderate recovery from the Period 9 dip.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basic) shows a high-level volatility with a baseline shift identified in Period 7 (averaging ~370 for two weeks). However, the most recent three periods (P9: 271, P10: 310) show a significant cool-down from that peak. The current date (2019/04/22) follows the Easter peak (likely captured in P10 or leading up to it), and demand is stabilizing. While P10 showed a slight recovery (310) from P9 (271), the average of the last two periods (~290) is lower than the Spring baseline previously noted (370). For Period 11, I expect demand to remain in the 280-320 range as the post-holiday period settles into a normal Spring baseline for basic jersey items.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a base level around 300-370 units during the spring season. However, Period 11 (2019/4/22) shows a massive spike to 564 units (+82% vs Period 10). This aligns with the week leading up to late April and early May, which often correlates with 'Mid-Season Sales' or seasonal transitions to warmer weather for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts). The jump from 310 to 564 is likely a peak event or promotion. Period 12 (Apr 29 - May 5) typically sees a slight cooling off after such a massive spike, but usually remains higher than the previous baseline as warmer weather sustains interest in t-shirts. I expect demand to regress back toward the higher-end baseline of 400-450 units, balancing the post-peak drop with seasonal momentum.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 11 (2019/4/22): demand surged to 564 units, representing an 80% increase over the previous period, likely driven by late-April seasonal promotions or weather shifts.

Predicted demand: 435 units

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a baseline of ~300 units with high volatility in April. Period 11 saw a massive spike to 564 (late April), which began to cool in Period 12 (424). For Period 13 (2019/5/6), the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) is entering high-season relevance as temperatures rise in the Northern Hemisphere. Looking at the trend, the massive spike in Period 11 is likely an outlier or a promotion effect, but the 'post-spike' value of 424 is still significantly higher than the March/early April average (~315). I anticipate a continued normalization back toward a higher spring baseline. Given the descent from 564 to 424, a further drop toward the 350-400 range is expected as the initial late-April surge stabilizes.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this basic T-shirt showed a significant localized spike in Period 11 (564 units) and Period 12 (424 units), likely tied to late April/early May transitions. However, Period 13 (304 units) shows a sharp return toward the baseline levels established in Periods 7-10 (averaging ~330). As the date is mid-May (2019/5/13), the extreme volatility seen in late April appears to be subsiding, settling into a higher spring baseline than earlier in the year but lower than the promotion/weather-driven peak. Given the 28% drop between Period 12 and 13, I expect a slight further stabilization or minor oscillation around the 300-320 mark.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this basic jersey T-shirt shows a general upward trend as the season transitions from late winter into spring/early summer. The 'Carry-over insights' highlight a baseline shift to ~370 in April. Recent volatility is noted: a massive spike to 564 (Period 11), followed by a correction to 424 and 304, then another jump back to 431 in Period 14 (mid-May). Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, demand typically strengthens as temperatures rise in May. The average demand over the last four periods (11-14) is 430.75. Given the recent climb back to 431 in Period 14 and the seasonal relevance for late May, I expect demand to remain elevated but stabilize slightly from the most recent peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility regime in May: demand fluctuating between 300 and 560 with a weekly average of ~430 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear upward shift as the season progresses into warmer months. Analyzing the recent periods (11-15), demand has entered a high-volatility regime with a higher mean. The last two periods (14 and 15) show stability and slight growth (431 to 442). Period 16 (2019/5/27) coincides with the Memorial Day holiday in some regions, which typically drives retail traffic for summer basics. Given the sustained high-volatility average of ~430 units over the last 4 periods and the slight upward momentum in the most recent two weeks, I expect demand to remain strong and slightly increase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear seasonal progression from a baseline of ~270 in Feb/March to a higher plateau in May. Recent demand (Periods 14-16) has stabilized around an average of 436 units (431, 442, 435), indicating a settled high-demand regime for early summer. The Period 11 spike (564) appears to be an outlier or specific promotion, whereas the last three weeks show very low variance. As we enter June (Period 17), demand for 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts typically remains strong and steady. Given the three-week consistency at the ~435-440 level, I expect demand to remain within this range.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized high-demand regime in late May: Period 14-16 average of 436 units with very low variance (<2% deviation), confirming a steady summer baseline for the product.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt shows a clear upward trend as summer approaches. Recent demand in mid-to-late May (Periods 14-16) stabilized around a high baseline of 436 units. Period 17 (2019/6/03) saw a significant surge to 640 units (a 47% increase from the previous baseline), likely driven by early June seasonal shopping and warmer weather. For Period 18 (2019/6/10), demand is expected to remain highly elevated as summer peaking begins. While Period 17 might be a spike, the seasonal context for lightweight jersey basics suggests a sustained high-demand environment. I expect demand to consolidate slightly below the peak but remain well above the May average.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike at Period 17 (June start): demand increased from a 436 average to 640 (+47%), signaling the start of peak summer seasonality.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a core summer baseline established in mid-late May (Periods 14-16) at ~436 units. Period 17 saw a massive peak of 640 (likely a June/Summer launch or promotion), which then corrected to 419 in Period 18. This 419 figure is remarkably close to the previous 'steady' baseline of 436 (-4%). As we are in mid-June (June 17), demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is expected to remain firm. However, the drop from 640 to 419 suggests the surge has passed. Period 19 will likely gravitate back towards the established steady summer baseline. I will project a slight recovery from the Period 18 dip while respecting the recent mean of the last 5 periods (~467) vs the last 2 periods (~530 weighted downward). I forecast a demand of 435, aligning with the stabilized high-demand regime identified in Period 17.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear elevated baseline for the summer season. Following a peak of 640 in Period 17 (early June), the demand has settled into a stable range. Periods 18 and 19 recorded 419 and 439 units respectively, which aligns closely with the previous stable regime observed in May (avg ~436). The date (June 24) is late June, which typically sees steady demand for lightweight jersey basics. Given the low variance between Period 18 and 19 and the historical stability at this level, I forecast the demand for Period 20 to remain around this current baseline, allowing for a slight uptick as summer heat continues.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear peak in early June (Period 17: 640 units) followed by a stabilization and a recent sharp decline in Period 20 (301 units, a ~31% drop from Period 19). Although Period 17 was an outlier, the baseline from late May (Periods 14-16) and June (Periods 18-19) consistently hovered around 420-440 units. The Period 20 drop to 301 is significant and likely represents a mid-summer cooling or a post-promotional trough. For July 1st (Period 21), I anticipate a modest recovery toward the established summer baseline of ~400 units as consumers shop for July weather, but I will temper the forecast due to the exhaustion seen in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: End of peak summer surge: After the June peak (640 units), demand has regressed to a mean of ~380 units across the last 4 periods (Periods 17-20), signaling the end of the high-growth phase.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for this jersey t-shirt. After a significant summer peak in early June (Period 17: 640 units), demand has entered a sustained downward trend as the peak summer shopping season concludes. Specifically, the last four periods (Period 18-21) have seen demand drop from 419 to 232 units. The most recent observation (Period 21) shows a sharp decline to 232 units, which is below the Spring baseline and suggests a transition into mid-summer clearance or late-season tapering. Period 22 (July 8) typically sees a continued cooling of demand for basics as consumers transition toward vacation periods or early autumn resets. I expect demand to stabilize slightly or continue a minor descent from the recent low.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-summer contraction: Demand has declined for 5 consecutive periods since the June peak (640 to 232), dropping 63% from the seasonal high and establishing a new lower baseline of ~230-250 units in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. After a peak in early June (Period 17: 640 units), demand has experienced a consistent contraction as the peak summer buying season concludes. Recent demand has stabilized significantly over the last two periods (Period 21: 232, Period 22: 238), establishing a new mid-summer baseline. Given the stability between the last two periods and the lack of major upcoming retail events in mid-July to drive a resurgence, I expect demand to remain steady or continue a very slight downward glide toward the late-summer trough. The forecast weights the most recent two-period average (235) heavily while acknowledging the overall downward trend from the June peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a clear post-summer contraction for this basic T-shirt. After peaking at 640 units in early June (Period 17), demand has steadily declined. In the last three periods (P21-P23), demand has stabilized at a much lower baseline, recording 232, 238, and 212 units respectively. The most recent observation (212) suggests a continued slight tapering or stabilization at the lower end of the previously identified 230-250 range. As we are in late July, we expect this low-demand regime to persist before any potential late-summer or back-to-school transitions. Forecast is set near the 3-period average, accounting for the recent downward pressure.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1)' is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly seasonal. Historical data shows a clear lifecycle: a spring surge (Periods 7-11), a sustained summer peak (Periods 14-19), and a sharp post-peak contraction starting in late June. Over the last four periods (Period 21-24), the demand has stabilized around a new lower baseline following a 50%+ drop from June levels. Specifically, the last four observations are 232, 238, 212, and 207 units. This indicates a flattening of the downward trend as the product enters a late-summer steady state. Given the narrow range of 207-238 units over the last month and the most recent observation of 207, I expect demand to remain stable near this level for late July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this T-shirt SKU has shown a clear seasonal arc, peaking in early June (Period 17: 640) followed by a persistent decline throughout July. The Carry-over insight for Period 22 noted a contraction to a baseline of ~230-250 units, but the most recent data shows this floor has broken: demand has fallen for five consecutive weeks (232, 238, 212, 207, 154). The drop to 154 in Period 25 represents a 25% week-over-week decline. As of August 5th (Period 26), the product is in a late-summer clearance/low-demand phase. Given the acceleration of the downward trend in the last period, I expect demand to continue its descent or begin to stabilize at this lower level. A slight further decrease is projected to align with the current momentum.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward momentum through July/August: demand fallen for 5 consecutive periods (238 to 154), representing a late-summer seasonal low below the previously established baseline of 230.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a steep late-summer seasonal decline. Historical demand shows a consistent downward trend over the last 6 periods, falling from 301 units in late June to just 102 units in the most recent period (Period 26). This represents a total contraction of approximately 66% from the post-peak baseline. Specifically, the last two periods saw declines of 25% (207 to 154) and 34% (154 to 102). In August, demand for lightweight jersey basics typically reaches a seasonal trough before potential back-to-school or transitional autumn refreshes. Given the current momentum and the absence of any stabilization signals in the most recent data point, I expect demand to continue its descent, though the rate of decline may marginally decelerate as it approaches a fundamental floor.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer seasonal trough: Demand has dropped for 6 consecutive periods (301 to 102), reaching its lowest point in the observed data and falling below the early February baseline of ~150.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt shows a clear seasonal lifecycle: a spring growth phase, a summer peak (June), and a sharp late-summer contraction. Demand plummeted from a high of 640 in June (Period 17) to a trough of 102 in early August (Period 26). However, Period 27 (2019/08/12) shows a slight uptick to 120 units, suggesting the late-summer trough has likely bottomed out. Looking at the initial historical data provided (training period), demand around February started at roughly 148-175 units. As we move closer to the end of August, demand often begins a slow recovery or stabilizes as consumers start looking for transition pieces or back-to-school basics. Given the slight increase in the most recent period (+17%), I expect the demand to stabilize at a bottom baseline between 120-135 units for Period 28.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this T-shirt SKU (610776002) shows a strong seasonal pattern. After peaking in early June (640 units), demand underwent a significant contraction throughout July and early August, bottoming out at 102 units (Period 26) as summer clearance likely concluded. Recent data for the last three periods (102, 120, 158) indicates a reversal of this downward trend and the beginning of a recovery phase. The date (2019/08/26) corresponds to the end of August / late-summer period where retailers often see a shift toward 'everyday basics' as part of Back-to-School shopping or early transitional season interest. Demand has increased by approximately 18% and 32% sequentially in the last two weeks. Following this upward trajectory, I expect demand to continue rising as it moves away from the seasonal trough towards its historical baseline.

Carry-over insight: End of late-summer trough: Demand has increased for two consecutive periods (102 to 158), showing a ~55% recovery from the seasonal low, signaling the start of a post-summer demand stabilization/increase.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major seasonal peak in June (640 units) followed by a sharp contraction throughout July and August. A seasonal trough was reached in Period 26 (102 units). Since then, demand has shown signs of stabilization/recovery (120, 158, 140). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, typically seen as a summer item or a year-round basic. Entering September (Period 30), we anticipate demand to maintain its current post-trough floor. While there was a slight dip from Period 28 to 29, the average of the last three periods (139) suggests a baseline much higher than the August low. We project a slight stabilization around 145 units for the transition into the school/fall season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) shows a distinct seasonal cycle: an upward trend in spring (Feb-Apr), a peak in early summer (June), and a sharp contraction throughout July and August. In the most recent periods (Period 26 to 30), the product reached a seasonal trough of 102 units and has since stabilized. Specifically, the last three periods (28, 29, 30) recorded demands of 158, 140, and 145 units respectively. This indicates that the late-summer downward momentum has ceased and demand is currently oscillating around a new baseline of approximately 140-150 units. For early September (Period 31), there are no major immediate retail holidays to drive a spike, so I expect demand to follow the current stable post-trough trend.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized demand floor in early September: Demand has successfully emerged from the seasonal low (102 units) and flattened to a mean of 147 units over the last 3 periods (Periods 28-30), confirming the end of the post-summer contraction.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt has moved out of its late-summer trough (102 units in Period 26) and has entered a period of stability. Over the last four periods (Periods 28-31), demand has been tightly clustered around a mean of 146 units (158, 140, 145, 141) with minimal variance. As we are in mid-September, demand for basics typically remains steady before any potential autumn shifts. Given the low volatility and consistent baseline established over the last month, the forecast for Period 32 predicts a continuation of this stable trend.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable post-summer phase. Historically, the product saw a peak in June (640 units) followed by a sharp contraction through August. Since Period 28 (late August), demand has stabilized significantly. The last five periods (28-32) show a very narrow range: 158, 140, 145, 141, and 135 units, resulting in a 5-week average of 144 units. The recent trend shows a very slight cooling (down to 135), but as an 'Everyday Basic', the demand is unlikely to drop much further below this established floor of ~135-145 units in late September. Therefore, the forecast is set near the most recent observation and the 5-week average.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. After peaking in June (640 units), demand underwent a significant contraction through July and August. Current demand has stabilized at a new low-level baseline since Period 28. Over the last six periods (Periods 28-33), demand has averaged 144 units with very low variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 8 units), ranging from 135 to 158. Specifically, the last four periods (Periods 30-33) show a steady mean of 142 units. Given the transition into late September (2019/9/30), there is typically no upward seasonal driver for a lightweight basic T-shirt in many markets as colder weather approaches, suggesting demand will remain flat at this established floor. The forecast takes the recent 4-period average (142) and adjusts slightly for the most recent observation (147).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basic). Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand phase in spring/summer (peaking at 640 in June) followed by a significant seasonal contraction starting in July. Over the last seven periods (Periods 28-34), demand stabilized into a low-volume floor, averaging approximately 133 units. Period 34 (2019/09/30) recorded 106 units, reaching its lowest point since the mid-August trough. Given the date (early October), we are entering a period where lightweight basics typically experience further cooling in demand as consumer focus shifts toward heavier layers and knitwear for autumn. The forecast anticipates demand remains near the established seasonal floor but reflects the recent downward pressure observed in the latest period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle for this lightweight T-shirt, peaking in June (640 units) and declining through the summer. After a brief stabilization in September around 140 units (Periods 31-33), demand has entered a significant Autumn contraction. Recent demand has dropped for three consecutive periods (147 to 106 to 85), representing a ~42% decline from the September baseline. As we enter mid-October (Period 36), the shift toward heavier garments typically accelerates, further depressing demand for jersey basics. The forecast anticipates a continuation of this downward trajectory toward a winter floor.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand contraction confirmed: Demand has broken below the early September stabilization level (~140 units) for 3 consecutive periods, falling to 85 units (-42%) as of Period 35.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is currently in its autumn contraction phase, moving through late October. Historically, the product saw a peak in June (640 units) and has been on a long-term decline as seasonality shifts toward colder weather. Recent demand has dropped significantly from the early September stabilization level (~145 units) to a new low. Periods 35 and 36 show strong stability at this lower level with 85 and 84 units respectively. Given the consistency of the last two weeks and the lack of upcoming major retail events in this specific late-October window for basic T-shirts, I expect demand to remain flat at this seasonal floor.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a clear autumn contraction, with Period 35 and 36 hitting yearly lows of 85 and 84 units respectively. However, Period 37 (2019/10/21) shows a slight uptick to 109 units (+30% from the bottom). Analysis of the product as a 'Womens Everyday Basic' suggests that while it is primarily a warm-weather item, it remains relevant as a layering piece in late autumn. Similar stabilization patterns were observed in the late-summer trough (Periods 26-29) before a brief recovery. For late October (Period 38), demand is expected to consolidate around the 100-unit mark as the product transitions into a low-volume winter baseline. I anticipate a minor regression from the Period 37 lift but staying above the 80s floor.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt shows a clear seasonal cycle. Demand peaked in June (640 units) and has since undergone a sustained decline as temperatures cooling. In the most recent 5 periods (Periods 34-38), demand has entered a low-volume regime, averaging approximately 92 units, compared to the early October average of ~100-140. This reflects a typical autumn contraction for a lightweight summer-oriented basic. Period 38 saw a drop to 78 units, the lowest in the current cycle. Given the date (Nov 4), we are in a pre-holiday trough. While there might be minor fluctuations, the immediate trend is stagnant at this lower baseline. I expect demand to remain within the 75-95 unit range, with a slight adjustment toward the recent 5-period mean.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) shows a persistent downward trend throughout Autumn, reaching a new low of 61 units in Period 39. The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 36-39) is 83 units, significantly lower than the September baseline of ~140. However, the current date (November 11) marks the start of the 'Singles' Day' (11/11) and pre-Black Friday retail period. While this product is a lightweight summer basic, seasonal promotions often trigger a small, temporary lift in demand for everyday items even in off-seasons. Given the consecutive declines in Periods 38 and 39 (78 to 61), a pure mathematical trend would suggest a further drop; however, the influence of mid-November promotional events is expected to provide a minor floor or slight recovery. I anticipate the demand will stabilize slightly above the most recent low but remain within the current late-Autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Autumn/Winter floor established: demand has averaged 83 units over the last 4 periods (Periods 36-39), representing a ~40% decrease from the early September stabilization level and a new historical seasonal trough.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product is in a clear seasonal trough. After stabilizing around 140-150 units in September, demand entered an Autumn/Winter contraction phase. In the last five periods (Periods 36-40), demand has dropped significantly, averaging approximately 80 units. The most recent two periods (39 and 40) show the lowest volumes yet at 61 and 69 units respectively. While Period 40 (Nov 11) showed a minor relative uptick from Period 39, the overall trend remains deeply bearish for this lightweight jersey T-shirt as late November approaches. Given the transition into colder weather and the lack of holiday-specific demand for this basic SKU so far, a continuation of the low-volume floor (approx. 60-70 units) is expected.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the product has entered its lowest structural demand regime (late Autumn/Winter). The Carry-over insight from Period 40 identified a seasonal trough averaging 83 units, but the most recent three periods (39, 40, 41) show a further local stabilization at a mean of 66 units (61, 69, 67). The current date is November 25th, which aligns with 'Black Friday' week in the retail calendar. While this product is a basic lightweight T-shirt (less seasonally relevant for winter), widespread retail promotions typically induce a lift in general traffic and 'basics' purchasing. I expect a moderate uplift from the currently stagnant baseline of ~66 units due to these seasonal sale events, though restricted by the off-season nature of the garment category.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has shown strong seasonal sensitivity, peaking in summer (P17: 640 units) and troughing in autumn/winter. After a sustained seasonal low averaging ~65 units (Periods 39-41), Period 42 (2019-11-25) saw a significant jump to 109 units (+63%), coinciding with Black Friday week. Period 43 (2019-12-02) covers the Cyber Monday period and the beginning of December holiday shopping. While the product is a summer-staple 'Everyday Basic', holiday promotional activity typically sustains elevated demand compared to the November floor. I expect demand to remain higher than the pre-holiday baseline but taper slightly from the peak Black Friday spike as the primary promotional weekend concludes.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basic), which has followed a distinct seasonal decline from its June peak. Current demand has entered an Autumn/Winter trough, as noted in previous insights. Following a temporary spike to 109 units in Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand returned to its baseline in Period 43 (61 units). The average demand over the last five non-promotional periods (Periods 39-41, 43) is 64.5 units. Given the date (Dec 9), we anticipate demand to remain stable at this established seasonal floor, as basic T-shirts are less likely to see significant pre-Christmas surges compared to gift-oriented categories.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern for this basic T-shirt. After a significant peak in June (640 units), demand underwent a long-term contraction throughout late summer and autumn. Period 40 identified a seasonal trough of ~83 units. However, the most recent 5 periods (40-44) show a further decline in the baseline, averaging 72 units. Specifically, the last two periods (43 and 44) have recorded the lowest demands in the entire dataset (61 and 55 units). Given that the current date is December 16, typically a period where demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts is at its annual minimum due to winter seasonality, and considering the immediate downward momentum (from 109 to 61 to 55), a forecast reflecting this continuing trough is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: New seasonal low confirmed in December: demand dropped to an average of 58 units over Periods 43-44, approximately 30% below the previously established Autumn/Winter floor of 83 units.

Predicted demand: 53 units

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows strong seasonality, with peaks in April (564) and June (640), followed by a steady decline into the winter months. Recent demand (Periods 43-45) has established a new seasonal trough, averaging 60 units (61, 55, 64). Period 46 corresponds to the week starting December 23rd (Christmas week). For a basic T-shirt staple, this is a low-demand period due to the cold weather and a shift in consumer focus toward holiday gifts and winter apparel rather than lightweight basics. While end-of-year clearance sales may begin, their impact on basic jersey tees is typically minimal compared to a sustained baseline. Given the stability of the recent demand floor, I expect Period 46 to remain consistent with the current five-week average of approximately 60-65 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Period 46 (Dec 23) showed a significant uptick to 92 units, up from the established December floor of ~60 units, likely driven by holiday shopping and the start of post-Christmas clearance events. Period 47 (Dec 30) encompasses the New Year's transition and the continuation of winter sales. While the December baseline has been lower than autumn, the end-of-year momentum usually sustains a slightly higher level than the mid-month trough before heading into the early January inventory turnover. I expect demand to remain near the 85-95 unit range, mirroring the strength seen in Period 46 as consumers take advantage of seasonal discounts on basics.
