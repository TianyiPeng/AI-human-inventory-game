Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The past five periods show a strong upward trend from 148 to 308, indicating increasing momentum. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is Feb 11, 2019. In the retail calendar, this follows the post-holiday slump and leads into the spring transition. As a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, this item is a year-round staple but often sees increased interest as customers begin layer-friendly spring shopping. 3. Trend Analysis: There is a clear and consistent week-over-week increase in the historical data (148 -> 175 -> 160 -> 233 -> 308). The jump from 233 to 308 (+32%) suggests a significant ramp-up. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the strong upward momentum and the approach of the spring season, demand is expected to continue rising, though potentially at a slightly moderated pace to account for the recent large jump.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand trend confirmed over past 5 periods: demand increased from 148 to 308 (avg growth ~20% per period).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend peaking at 308. However, the first test period (Period 1, 2019/2/11) recorded 266 units, which is a decline from the training peak but still significantly higher than the initial training average. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees steady or increasing demand as spring approaches in late February. Given the date (2019/2/18) is mid-February, we are entering a transition into the spring season where basic layers often see stable demand. The drop from 308 to 266 suggests the extreme growth seen in the training set has stabilized. I expect demand to remain relatively flat or show a slight recovery as spring shopping gains momentum.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend peaking at 308. In the current test phase, Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316) confirm that demand remains high and is continuing to grow. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' likely seeing increased demand as the transition from winter to spring begins in late February. Given the 18.7% increase from Period 1 to Period 2 and the overall momentum, a further increase is expected for Period 3 (Feb 25), reflecting pre-spring shopping behavior.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as spring approaches. Historical demand from the training period showed a strong upward trend (148 to 308). In the current test phase (Periods 1-3), demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging approximately 296 units (266, 316, 306). The date of March 4th signals the start of the pre-spring retail season, where lightweight jersey items often see a sustained or slightly increasing demand. While the most recent period saw a slight dip from 316 to 306, the overall level remains significantly higher than the early training data. I expect demand to remain stable or slightly increase as the weather warms, following the established higher regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~296 units over the last 3 periods compared to the early training average, representing a sustained shift to a higher baseline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend peaking at 308. In the test phase (Periods 1-4), the demand has stabilized at a higher level than the early training mean, consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' of a new regime averaging approximately 293 units (266, 316, 306, 283). The current date is March 11, 2019. This is the transition into spring in the Northern Hemisphere, which is typically favorable for 'Womens Everyday Basics' like a lightweight jersey T-shirt. While there was a slight dip in Period 4 (283), the overall four-week average is 292.75. Given the seasonal relevance of the product (T-shirt) as we enter spring, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly recover from the Period 4 dip, aligning with the established regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $879.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the test phase peaked in Period 2 (316 units) and has since shown a consistent downward trajectory over the last three periods (306, 283, and 252). While the product is a staple T-shirt suited for the transition into spring (mid-March), the current trend suggests a cooling-off period following an early-season surge in February. The average demand of the test phase is approximately 285 units, but the most recent observation (252) is significantly below this and the previous regime mean of 296. I expect the demand to continue its recent decline of roughly 10-12% per week as it approaches a more sustainable baseline.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend detected: Demand has decreased for 3 consecutive periods (306 to 252), dropping approximately 17% from the February peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1025.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this basic T-shirt showed a significant jump from the training period (avg ~205) to a higher regime in the test phase (avg ~282). After peaking at 316 units in mid-February (Period 2), demand experienced a four-week cooling period, bottoming out at 252 units in Period 5. Period 6 (270 units) broke this downward trend with a 7% week-over-week increase. Given that the current date (March 25) aligns with the onset of Spring in many markets, demand for everyday jersey basics typically stabilizes or increases as consumers transition to warmer-weather wardrobes. The forecast anticipates a continued modest recovery toward the test phase mean.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt showed an initial peak in mid-February (~316), followed by a gradual decline into mid-March (bottoming at 252), and then a significant surge in Period 7 (364). This surge (approx. +35% from the previous week) aligns with the end of March/beginning of April, a period typically associated with the onset of Spring shopping and preparations for warmer weather. As the current date is April 1st, demand is expected to remain elevated or slightly increase as seasonal momentum builds for basic lightweight jersey tops. The previous 'downward trend' noted in Period 6 has been invalidated by the strong recovery in Period 7. I forecast a slight continuation of this upward momentum.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basic) showed an initial upward trend, followed by a brief cooling period in early March. However, recent data shows a significant and sustained surge: demand increased from 270 (Period 6) to 364 (Period 7) and 372 (Period 8). This represents a jump to a higher demand regime (~360+ units). Seasonally, April (Period 9: 2019/4/8) aligns with the beginning of spring in many markets, which typically drives demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts ('Everyday Basics'). Given the stability between Period 7 and 8, and the upcoming seasonal relevance, the forecast anticipates a slight continued rise or stability at this high level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 8: demand has shifted from an average of ~280 to a higher baseline of ~368 over the last two periods (+31%), likely driven by seasonal spring transition.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear shift in late March/early April, with Period 7 and 8 spiking to ~368 units (a +31% increase from the prior average). Period 9 (2019/4/8) saw a sharp decline to 271 units. The current date is 2019/4/15, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday (April 21, 2019). Historically, apparel retail experiences a significant 'Easter peak' in the week immediately preceding the holiday as consumers shop for spring basics. While Period 9 dropped, it likely represents a lull before the holiday surge. Given the product's category (Everyday Basics / Jersey T-shirt) and the seasonality of April, I expect demand to rebound toward the higher regime seen in Periods 7 and 8 to capture holiday-related shopping.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an initial upward trend. In the test phase (Periods 1-10), demand peaked at Period 8 (372 units) during the spring transition, followed by a sharp drop in Period 9 (271 units) and a moderate recovery in Period 10 (310 units). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly relevant as temperatures rise in late April. Period 10 (April 15) saw 310 units; Period 11 (April 22) is the week following Easter 2019 (April 21). Typically, retail demand sees a post-holiday stabilization or slight dip after the holiday weekend surge, but the general seasonal trend for 'Everyday Basics' T-shirts remains positive heading into May. Given the recent volatility (372 -> 271 -> 310), I expect demand to stabilize near the current mean of the last four periods (~315) as the spring season solidifies.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt showed a stable high regime around 360-370 units in early April (Periods 7-8), followed by a brief dip. Period 11 (2019-04-22) showed a massive spike to 564 units (+82% vs previous week). This spike aligns perfectly with the lead-up to the Easter holiday (April 21) and the transition into late spring/early summer weather, which typically drives demand for jersey basics. Period 12 (2019-04-29) follows the holiday peak; while seasonal interest in T-shirts remains high, the immediate 'holiday shopping' surge usually recedes. Comparing the previous regime of ~310-370 and the recent outlier, I expect demand to settle at a higher post-holiday baseline, but significantly lower than the 564 peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a general upward trend as we transition into spring, with a significant spike in Period 11 (564 units) coinciding with late April. This spike was followed by a correction in Period 12 (424 units), which remains significantly higher than the mid-April baseline (~300 units). The current date is May 6, 2019. In retail, early May often sees sustained higher demand for 'Everyday Basics' like jersey T-shirts due to warming weather and preparation for summer. While the Period 11 peak was likely an outlier or a specific promotional/holiday event (e.g., Easter/Spring break tail-end), the new baseline appears to be settling between 400 and 450 units. I expect demand to stabilize slightly lower than the Period 12 figure but remain well above the March/April average.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 12: baseline has shifted from ~300 to ~450 (+50%) following the late-April seasonal surge.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a high level of volatility. The training data (148 to 308) and test data (266 to 564) indicate an overall upward trajectory as we enter warmer months (Spring/Summer), which is consistent with the product being a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. However, recent performance shows a significant cooling: demand peaked at 564 in Period 11 (late April) and has since declined to 424 (Period 12) and 304 (Period 13). This suggests the late-April surge (potentially driven by pre-summer shopping or specific promotions) has subsided. The 'Period 13' carry-over insight suggesting a new baseline of ~450 is now challenged by the actual observation of 304. Given the date (May 13), we are in a steady-state spring period. I expect demand to stabilize near the recent 304 level or see a slight recovery as summer approaches, but the immediate trend is downward. I will forecast a value slightly above the most recent observation to account for the broader seasonal upward trend while respecting the recent sharp decline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a general upward trend as the season moves into spring/summer. Over the last 4 periods (Periods 11-14), demand has entered a higher, albeit volatile, regime with an average of 430 units, compared to the Period 1-10 average of ~300. Period 11 saw a massive spike (564) likely due to a specific event/promotion, followed by a correction and then a recovery in Period 14 (431). Given the current date (May 20), we are in a peak seasonal window for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts. The most recent observation (431) aligns with the higher baseline established in late April. I expect demand to remain in this elevated range as warmer weather sets in, targeting the average of the recent high-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility seen in the last few weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a significant shift in demand baseline. While early periods (1-6) averaged around 282 units, the most recent periods (11-15) show a much higher mean of approximately 433 units. This 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt is experiencing increased demand as we move into late May (Current Date: 2019/5/27), consistent with seasonal transition into summer for the Northern Hemisphere. Period 11 saw a major spike (564), followed by a stabilization phase. The last two weeks (Periods 14 and 15) have shown consistent demand at 431 and 442 units respectively. Given the upward trajectory of the mean and the proximity to the summer season, I expect demand to remain in this higher regime, likely sustaining the slight upward momentum seen in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Baseline has shifted from a training average of ~185 to a sustained recent average of ~433 (+134%) over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), driven by seasonal transition into summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this lightweight T-shirt shows a clear upward shift as the season transitions into summer. Analyzing the 'Observed Demand', we see a regime change starting around Period 11 (late April), where demand jumped significantly. The last three periods (P14-P16) have shown remarkable stability with demands of 431, 442, and 435 respectively (averaging ~436). This indicates the product has reached a stable peak-season baseline. As we enter early June (Period 17), the weather typically remains favorable for jersey basics, maintaining this high plateau. Given the tight variance in the most recent three weeks, I expect the demand to remain within this established range, slightly favoring the most recent stable average.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal transition for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. The product recently moved from a spring baseline of ~300 units to a sustained early-summer baseline of ~436 units (Periods 14-16). Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640 units (+47% over the recent average), coinciding with the start of June. While this likely represents a peak summer surge or promotional event, similar spikes in the past (e.g., Period 11 at 564 units) were followed by a moderate correction rather than a total return to the previous baseline. Given the strong seasonal relevance of the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt in mid-June, demand is expected to remain high but regress slightly from the Period 17 peak. The forecast of 510 reflects a value between the recent stable baseline and the latest peak.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we move into the summer season. The 'Carry-over Insights' note a sustained shift to a higher baseline (avg ~433) starting around Period 11. Recent data (P14-P18) supports this, with values consistently above 400. Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640 (likely a specific promotion or early June heatwave), which retreated to 419 in Period 18. Period 18's demand of 419 is very close to the established late-May/early-June baseline of ~430-440. Given the date (June 17), we are in peak summer demand for lightweight basic T-shirts. I expect demand to remain stable near the current high-season baseline rather than repeating the P17 spike immediately.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a high-summer baseline averaging ~470 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), representing a significant increase from the spring baseline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a basic summer T-shirt currently in peak season (late June). Analysis of recent demand shows a significant spike in Period 17 (640 units), likely due to a specific event or early June promotion, followed by a return to a stable baseline. In the last two periods (P18 and P19), demand has leveled off at 419 and 439 units respectively. Excluding the P17 anomaly, the average demand over the last five periods (P14-P16, P18-P19) is approximately 433 units. Given the consistency of this 'high-summer' baseline and the lack of upcoming major holidays in the final week of June, I expect Period 20 to remain aligned with this recent trend.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lightweight t-shirt shows a clear seasonal increase moving into the summer months, with a peak baseline identified around ~470 units (Carry-over Period 19). However, the most recent observation (Period 20: 301 units) shows a significant 31% drop from Period 19 (439 units) and is the lowest demand seen since early May. This sharp decline at the end of June suggests either a post-peak correction, a stock-out (though I shouldn't assume inventory), or a potential shift in consumer behavior as mid-summer heat sets in. Given the previous volatility (e.g., Period 17 spike to 640 followed by a drop), I expect a partial recovery from the Period 20 low as we enter July, but I will weight the recent downward pressure. I'm forecasting a moderate rebound to 365, balancing the established high-summer baseline with the immediate downward momentum.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant 'high summer' peak between Periods 14 and 19, where demand averaged ~470 units. However, a sharp downward trend has emerged over the last two periods (P20: 301, P21: 232), representing a total decline of approximately 50% from the June peak. This aligns with the seasonal transition in early July, where demand for summer basics typically cools after the initial seasonal surge. Given the velocity of the decline over the last two weeks, the forecast for Period 22 anticipates a further slight cooling or stabilization as demand returns toward the baseline levels observed in early spring (Feb/Mar).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant demand peak during late May and June (averaging ~470 units). However, the last three periods (P20-P22) show a sharp and sustained decline: 301, 232, and 238 units respectively. This indicates the passing of the peak summer demand for this basic T-shirt. The data for the last two weeks (232 and 238) suggests demand is stabilizing at a new, lower mid-summer baseline. For Period 23 (July 15), I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent stabilization around the 235-245 range, as the initial drop has leveled off.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a high-summer average of ~470 (P14-P19) to a lower mid-summer baseline of ~257 (+/- 45 units) over the last 3 periods (P20-P22), marking the end of the seasonal peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt peaked in June (Periods 17-19) with an average of ~500 units but has since entered a significant downward trend as the peak summer season concludes. The demand regime shifted in late June, dropping from the high 400s to a new baseline. Over the last three periods (P21-P23), demand has stabilized at a lower level of 232, 238, and 212 units, respectively (averaging ~227). Given the date (July 22) and the consistent softening of demand over the last four weeks, I expect the next period to remain within this lower 210-230 range, likely continuing the slight downward drift seen in the most recent observation (212).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt) has transitioned out of its high-summer peak (P14-P19, avg ~470) into a lower late-summer baseline. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has averaged approximately 222 units (232, 238, 212, 207), showing a stabilization significantly below the spring/early-summer highs. The most recent two periods (212 and 207) suggest a slight continued softening as the season progresses into late July. Given this downward trajectory and the upcoming end of the summer season, I expect demand for Period 25 to remain near the current floor established over the last two weeks.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has entered a clear post-summer decline. Following a high-summer peak (P14-P19 avg ~470), demand dropped to a mid-summer baseline of ~257 (P20-P22). Most recently, demand has fallen further, with the last three periods (P23-P25) recording 212, 207, and 154 units respectively. The sharp drop to 154 in P25 indicates that the product is exiting its primary seasonal window. For Period 26 (August 5th), demand is expected to remain at this lower baseline or decrease slightly further as retailers transition to fall assortments. A forecast of 145 accounts for the continued downward momentum while acknowledging the product's nature as an everyday basic.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a mid-summer average of ~257 to a lower late-summer baseline of ~191 units (P23-P25), representing a ~25% decrease as the peak season concludes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this basic T-shirt. Demand peaked during the high-summer period (P14-P19) with an average of ~470 units, followed by a transition into a mid-summer baseline of ~257 units (P20-P22), and a late-summer baseline of ~191 units (P23-P25). Period 26 (102 units) shows a significant further decline of ~33% from the P25 level and ~47% from the P23-P25 average. This sharp drop-off in early August aligns with the end-of-summer clearance cycle in retail, where demand for lightweight jersey basics typically collapses to make room for autumn/winter transitions. Given the momentum of the last four periods (212 -> 207 -> 154 -> 102), a continued downward trajectory is expected for Period 27 as the product exits its peak seasonal relevance.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend acceleration: Demand has fallen for 4 consecutive periods (P23-P26), dropping from 212 to 102 units (-52%), indicating the product is entering a post-summer low-demand phase.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt peaked in June (Period 17: 640 units) and has since been in a significant seasonal decline as summer ends. Demand dropped from 207 units in Period 24 to a low of 102 units in Period 26. The most recent observation (Period 27: 120 units) shows a slight stabilization or minor recovery after the sharp descent, suggesting the product is bottoming out at a late-season baseline. Given the date (August 19), we are in the final transition out of summer peak. I expect demand to remain low but relatively stable around the recent 3-period average (~125 units), potentially tapering slightly as the transition to autumn continues.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt reached a seasonal floor of 102 units in early August (P26) following a sharp post-summer decline. However, the last two periods (P27: 120, P28: 158) show a clear reversal and recovery trend. As of August 26, we are in the 'Back-to-School' and late-summer transition period, which typically drives a modest uptick in basic apparel. The demand has increased by an average of ~28 units per week over the last two periods. Following this momentum and the seasonal transition, I expect demand to continue its recovery towards a stabilized late-season baseline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 reached a seasonal trough in early August (Period 26: 102 units). Since then, demand has stabilized at a lower baseline, showing a slight recovery with observations of 120, 158, and 140 units. The average for the last three periods (P27-P29) is approximately 139 units. The current date, September 2nd, coincide with Labor Day 2019, a major retail event that typically provides a minor lift for everyday basics like T-shirts. Given the recent stabilization and the holiday factor, the forecast expects demand to remain steady or slightly elevated compared to the immediate prior period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a late-summer/early-autumn baseline averaging ~130 units over the last 4 periods (P26-P29), marking the end of the sharp downward trend seen in July.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has stabilized following the sharp decline observed in late July. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has moved from a low of 102 to a consistent range between 140 and 158 in the most recent three weeks. Specifically, the last three observations (158, 140, 145) suggest a firm late-summer/early-autumn baseline. As of September 9th, the peak summer season is over, and demand for basic jersey T-shirts typically remains steady at a lower maintenance level before further cooling or shifting to layering pieces. The average of the last three periods is approximately 147 units. Given the stability between P29 (140) and P30 (145), I forecast the demand for P31 to remain within this established range.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has transitioned from its peak summer season (P14-P19 avg ~470) into a stabilized late-summer/early-autumn baseline. After a sharp decline in July and early August, the demand has leveled off significantly. Over the last four periods (P28-P31), demand has remained extremely stable, ranging between 140 and 158 units with an average of approximately 146 units. Given the consistency of the last three observations (140, 145, 141), there is no evidence of a further downward trend or a new seasonal spike. As we are now in mid-September, demand for this 'Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt is expected to maintain this steady floor before any potential shift toward autumn/winter layering behavior.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:

The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has entered a stable, low-volume regime following the sharp decline from its summer peak. Over the last seven periods (P26-P32), demand has fluctuated narrowly between 102 and 158 units. The most recent four periods (P29-P32) show a very consistent baseline with an average of approximately 140 units (140, 145, 141, 135). As of late September (2019/09/23), the transition into autumn typically keeps demand for lightweight basic T-shirts flat as they shift from primary garments to layering pieces. There is no evidence of a further downward trend or a new seasonal spike, suggesting the current baseline will persist.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The product saw a significant peak in demand during the spring and early summer (P11-P19), followed by a sharp decline throughout July and August. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: As a 'Womens Everyday Basic' lightweight T-shirt, demand has transitioned from a seasonal summer peak to a stable autumn baseline. September 30th is a standard transitional period. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand has stabilized remarkably over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), fluctuating in a narrow band between 135 and 158 units. The average for the last 4 periods is approximately 142 units. (4) Final forecast logic: Given the current stability and the lack of upcoming major retail events or seasonal shifts for this specific garment type, I expect demand to remain consistent with the recent 4-week average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. After a summer peak (averaging ~470 in P14-P19), demand transitioned through a downward trend to a stabilized autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged approximately 135 units. While Period 34 showed a dip to 106, the preceding four periods (P30-P33) were consistently between 135 and 147. Given the transition into October, we expect demand to remain in this low-demand autumn regime. The forecast weights the recent stable average (approx. 130-140) but acknowledges the potential continued slight cooling indicated by the P34 result.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight basic T-shirt has shown a clear downward shift as the season progresses into mid-October. After stabilizing at a baseline of ~130-140 units during September (P30-P33), demand has dropped significantly over the last two weeks: Period 34 (106) and Period 35 (85). This represents a ~40% decline from the September average, consistent with the product's seasonal profile as a summer/light-layering item. Given the current downward momentum and the mid-autumn date, I expect demand to continue its decline or stabilize at a lower baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this T-shirt shows a clear seasonal lifecycle, peaking in late spring/early summer (reaching >600 units) and declining through the autumn. Recent demand in late September to mid-October (P34-P36) shows a significant break from the previous stable baseline of ~140 units. Specifically, demand dropped to 106, then stabilized at 85 and 84 over the last two weeks. This suggests a new late-autumn regime as the product enters its off-season. Given the stability between P35 and P36, I expect the demand to remain around this new floor for the current period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a late-summer baseline of ~140 units to a lower late-autumn baseline averaging ~92 units (P34-P36), representing a ~34% decrease as seasonal relevance for lightweight jerseys declines.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which has seen a significant seasonal decline from its summer peak of ~470 units to a late-autumn baseline. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged approximately 96 units (106, 85, 84, 109). While Period 37 showed a slight increase to 109 units, the overall trend remains low as the weather cools. The forecast for Period 38 (late October) anticipates demand staying within this established late-autumn floor of 90-110 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt peaked in early summer (June) and has been in a sustained decline since. Period 37 confirmed a shift to a lower late-autumn baseline of ~92 units. Recent performance (P34-P38) shows a mean of approximately 92, with the most recent observation at 78 units. As we enter November, demand for summer-oriented basics typically remains low or decreases slightly further before any holiday-related fluctuations. The forecast assumes the current low-demand regime will continue, weighting the most recent period (78) alongside the period average.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this lightweight T-shirt peaked in early summer (P17: 640 units) and has since undergone several downward regime shifts as seasonal relevance declined. The most recent carry-over insight (P37) noted a shift to a baseline of ~92 units. However, demand has continued to erode over the last three periods (P37: 109, P38: 78, P39: 61), with P39 marking a new low for the test phase. Given the current date is Nov 11, the product is in its off-season (late autumn/winter), and the downward momentum is strong. While major retail dates like 11/11 exist, they rarely reverse the seasonal decline of lightweight summer basics significantly. I expect demand to continue its trajectory toward a winter trough, likely settling in the 50-60 unit range.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a late-autumn average of ~92 to a pre-winter baseline averaging ~83 units (P37-P39), with a clear downward trend as the product reaches its seasonal minimum.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its off-peak seasonal phase (mid-November). Historical data shows a clear downward trajectory from a high-summer baseline (~470 units) to a late-autumn baseline. Recent demand has stabilized at a significant low: Period 38 (78), Period 39 (61), and Period 40 (69). The average of the last three periods is approximately 69 units. Given the proximity to late November, demand is expected to remain near this seasonal floor. There is no evidence of a pre-holiday spike for this specific basic item yet, so the forecast maintains the recent three-period average while acknowledging the slight variance seen in the last two weeks.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has declined significantly from its summer peak (~470 units) to a late-autumn baseline. Recent observations show the demand has stabilized at a low level over the last three periods (P39: 61, P40: 69, P41: 67), averaging approximately 66 units. Period 42 (beginning 2019/11/25) includes Black Friday (Nov 29). While the product is seasonally less relevant in late November, major retail events typically trigger a temporary demand lift. I expect a moderate spike above the current baseline due to holiday promotions, followed by a return to the low-winter baseline in subsequent weeks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a low-winter baseline averaging ~66 units (P39-P41), representing the product's seasonal minimum before holiday promotional effects.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal low-demand phase (winter). Demand reached a baseline of ~67 units in mid-November (Periods 40-41). Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a significant increase to 109 units (+63%), coinciding with Black Friday. Period 43 (Dec 2) includes Cyber Monday and the start of the December holiday shopping period. While demand for lightweight jerseys typically remains low in winter, holiday promotional activity and gifting trends are expected to keep demand elevated above the November baseline, though likely slightly lower than the Black Friday peak as the initial surge tapers off.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product has reached its seasonal minimum, with demand stabilizing at a low-winter baseline. Excluding the Black Friday spike in Period 42 (109 units), recent demand has been consistently low: Period 39 (61), Period 40 (69), Period 41 (67), and Period 43 (61), resulting in a non-promotional average of approximately 65 units. Period 44 (Dec 9) represents the second week of December; while holiday shopping is active, demand for a lightweight summer-oriented jersey T-shirt is expected to remain at this baseline floor. The forecast anticipates a continuation of this stable winter demand level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a low-winter baseline averaging ~65 units (P39-P43, excluding the Black Friday outlier), representing the seasonal floor for this lightweight basic.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' lightweight T-shirt is currently in its seasonal low-winter phase. Following the Black Friday promotional spike (P42: 109), demand returned to its pre-winter baseline, with P43 at 61 units and P44 at 55 units. This indicates a continued slight downward trend or stabilization at the seasonal floor. As of Dec 16 (P45), the product is at its lowest seasonal relevance for the year. While general holiday retail traffic might provide a slight buffer, the specific category (lightweight jersey basics) typically continues to see minimal demand during this period. The forecast weights the most recent observation (55) and the recent non-promotional average (~60) to predict a stable but low demand for the current week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002, a lightweight T-shirt, is currently at its seasonal winter floor. Over the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has remained highly stable with values of 61, 55, and 64 units, averaging approximately 60 units. This aligns with the Carry-Over Insight from Period 44 which established a low-winter baseline of ~65 units. While Period 46 (2019/12/23) covers the Christmas week, basic jersey items typically do not see significant holiday spikes compared to gift-oriented categories, and the lightweight nature of the product limits its relevance in late December. Therefore, the forecast remains consistent with the established winter baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal low-point (winter). Historical data from Period 39 to 45 shows a very stable baseline averaging approximately 63 units, with a seasonal floor established around 55-65 units. Period 42 (109 units) was a clear outlier corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions. Period 46 (Dec 23) showed a moderate spike to 92 units, likely driven by last-minute holiday gift-giving or high-street traffic during the Christmas week. Period 47 (Dec 30) covers the post-Christmas/New Year's Eve week. While holiday traffic remains higher than November levels, the immediate 'gift' demand dissipates, and consumer focus often shifts towards winter clearance or early spring interest. Given the 'Everyday Basic' nature of the SKU, demand is expected to soften from the Christmas peak but remain slightly above the mid-winter floor (63) due to end-of-year clearance activity.
