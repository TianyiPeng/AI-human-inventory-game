It is an 'Everyday Basic', suggesting relatively stable demand, but potentially influenced by seasonal shifts. Date is Feb 11, 2019 (late winter/early spring transition). b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] show an upward trend, averaging ~205 units. The last two samples (233, 308) suggest a regime shift or seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. No history yet to verify. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: Since L=2, the order placed now must cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 rule). Forecasting ~230 per period based on recent historical samples to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost. Total needed = 230 * 3 = 690 units. Minus 0 on-hand/in-transit = 690.",

  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt. Historically, demand for basics is relatively stable but can fluctuate based on spring/summer transitions. In February (Northern Hemisphere), we might see a slight upward trend as spring approaches. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples were [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (Average: 204.8). Period 1 actual demand was 266, which is on the higher end of historical samples, suggesting a potential high-demand regime or seasonal uptick. c) Lead Time/Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (690 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (conclude visible in P4). d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. Since the P1 order hasn't arrived, demand in P1 (266) was lost, and P2 demand will also likely be lost because lead time is 2. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 3 (when the first shipment arrives) and Period 4 (when the next shipment arrives). Target stock = Demand Forecast * (L+1). With an average demand of ~260, I need ~780 units total pipeline. I have 690 in-transit.

  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight t-shirt, which is now in its late-autumn seasonal decline. Current demand in November has stabilized between 60-80 units per period (P39: 61, P40: 69). The inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit balance is 4,200, but based on historical analysis, the vast majority of this (4,000+ units from P3 through P36) is confirmed lost. Effective pipeline includes orders from P38 (100 units), P39 (100 units), and P40 (100 units). Given a volatile lead time of 1-3 periods, these 300 units are expected to arrive between P41 and P43. To cover the remaining 7 periods of the game (P41-P47) while accounting for the high risk of shipment loss, I will maintain a consistent ordering pattern of 100 units. This ensures that even with a 50%+ loss rate, we have enough stock to meet the ~70 units/period demand without incurring excessive holding costs if multiple shipments happen to arrive at once.",

Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline from summer peaks (400-600 units) to current late-autumn levels. Recent demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 61, 69, and 67 units, establishing a stable regime around 65-70 units/period. The lead time remains highly volatile, recently fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P37 arrived in 2, P40 arrived in 1). The 4,200 units in 'In-transit' are predominantly confirmed lost orders from P3-P36. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P38 (likely arriving now or lost), P39 (due now), and P41 (due P42/P43). Current on-hand is 33. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at ~70 units/period (total 210 units) and accounting for the unreliability of the pipeline, I will order 100 units to maintain a continuous flow of incoming stock without incurring excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (P47).",

  "rationale": "The SKU 610776002 is a women's lightweight jersey t-shirt. Current data shows we are entering early December. Historical patterns for this SKU and similar basics often see a secondary peak or stability during the holiday gift-giving season (December), followed by a clearance period in January. Demand in Period 42 was 109, an increase from the November average of ~65-70, suggesting the start of this December lift. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P39 arrived with LT=3, P41 with LT=1). The effective pipeline consists of orders from P38 (now 5 periods old, likely lost) and P42. Current on-hand is 124. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at an expected rate of ~110-130 units/period (accounting for holiday demand), I need approximately 330-390 units total. With 124 on-hand and 100 in-transit from P42, the current effective stock is 224. I will order 150 units to bolster the pipeline against potential holiday spikes and shipping delays.",

Demand in Period 42 showed a significant lift (109 units), although Period 43 dipped back to 61. Historically, late-autumn demand was ~60-80, while the December holiday shift suggests an average closer to 90-110 units/period. The supply chain is still highly unreliable; while recent orders (P37, P39, P40, P41) arrived with lead times of 1-3 periods, many previous orders are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 63. The order from P42 (100 units) is now at lead time 2 and should arrive soon. The order from P43 (150 units) is at lead time 1. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted ~100 units/period (300 units total), I need to account for the 63 on-hand and the 250 units in the effective pipeline (P42, P43). This total (313) barely covers the requirement. Given the high probability of shipment loss seen throughout the year, I will place a safety order of 100 units to ensure availability during the peak December weeks.",

  "rationale": "The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand in Period 42 showed a holiday lift (109 units), but recent demand in Periods 43-44 (avg ~58) suggests volatility or a pre-Christmas lull. Historical samples (avg 205) and early spring data (~300) suggest demand will rise significantly in early 2020. However, the game ends at Period 47, meaning only demand for Periods 45, 46, and 47 remains. On-hand inventory is 8 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 4,350 is almost entirely composed of lost units from P3-P36 and P38. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P42 (100 units), P43 (150 units), and P44 (100 units). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Order P42 is now 3 periods old and P43 is 2 periods old; both are likely to arrive in Period 45 or 46. To satisfy the remaining 3 periods of demand (estimated at 80-120 units each due to holiday/end-of-year activity) while accounting for the effective pipeline of 350 units and current 8 units on-hand, no further large orders are necessary to avoid high holding costs as the game concludes. A small safety order of 50 units is placed to cover potential late-period demand spikes if existing pipeline orders are lost.",

Demand has shown a slight holiday lift (Period 42: 109 units), but recent weeks (P43-P45) have averaged 60 units, suggesting the peak has passed or is stabilizing. Historically, 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts see a decline post-holiday. Inventory assessment: On-hand is 44. The 'In-transit' balance of 4,300 is overwhelmingly comprised of lost orders from earlier in the year. The effective pipeline includes orders from P43 (150), P44 (100), and P45 (50). The P43 order is now at T+3, which is the upper limit of observed lead times (1-3 periods). If P43 arrives in Period 46, we will have 150 + 44 = 194 units, covering ~3 periods of demand at current rates (~60-70 units). However, given the high frequency of lost orders (P31, P33, P36, P38 all likely lost), I must maintain a small continuous flow. I will order 50 units to keep the pipeline moving without overstocking, as Jan/Feb demand typically remains low for this category.",

Historically, demand for basic T-shirts saw a slight lift in December (averaging ~75 units over P42-P46) compared to November (~65 units). January typically sees a stabilization or minor decline as holiday shopping concludes. The effective pipeline includes orders from P43 (150 units, now 4 periods old and likely lost/delayed beyond the max observed lead time of 3) and P46 (50 units). On-hand inventory is currently 102 units. Given that the P43 order is likely lost, the 'real' pipeline is only 50 units (P46). With an expected demand of ~70-80 units per period and a target of covering 3 periods (L+1), the required inventory is ~210-240 units.
