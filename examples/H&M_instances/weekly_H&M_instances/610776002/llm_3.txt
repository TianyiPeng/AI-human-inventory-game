The goal is to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods to bridge the gap until the first order arrives. The historical demand samples provided [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] show an average of 204.8 units per period with an upward trend. The product 'Tilly' is a Women's Everyday Basic T-shirt, which typically faces steady demand, but the calendar date (February 11, 2019) suggests we are moving out of winter into spring in many markets, potentially increasing demand for jersey basics. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the 1-period observation lag, an order placed now will arrive in Period 5 and be reflected in my Period 6 decision. To cover demand for Periods 1-5, I calculate a requirement based on the recent average of ~200 units plus a buffer for the observed upward trend. 200 * 5 = 1000 units. I will order 1000 units now to establish initial stock as on-hand is currently 0.",

Historical demand samples (148-308) and recent demand observations (P1: 266, P2: 316, P3: 306, P4: 283) suggest a steady demand regime averaging approximately 300 units/period (P2-P4 avg is 301). Current date is March 11, moving into Spring, suggesting stable or slightly increasing demand for basics. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in P1 should arrive during P5's arrival phase (making it visible in P6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in history for P1-P4 is expected. Inventory calculation: We must cover demand for L+1 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9) because an order placed now (P5) arrives in P9. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~1,500 units. Current pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=2050 (from orders in P1: 1000, P2: 400, P3: 350, P4: 300). The pipeline already covers 2050 units, which is significantly more than the 1500 units needed for the next 5 periods.

  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its off-season (December). Recent demand has averaged approximately 70-80 units per period, with Period 43 showing a demand of 61. There is an ongoing stockout (on-hand is 0), and I am waiting for orders placed in Periods 41 (177 units), 42 (80 units), and 43 (126 units) to arrive. Given the confirmed 4-period lead time, the Period 41 order (177 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 45. However, since the current period is 44 and the game ends at Period 47, any order placed now (Period 44) would arrive in Period 48, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the pipeline already in transit (383 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (44, 45, 46, 47) considering the current low demand regime (~70-100 units/period). Additional ordering would only incur holding costs on ending inventory without the possibility of sales.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight T-shirt ('Women's Everyday Basics'), which is currently in its off-season (mid-December). Demand has stabilized at a low trough, averaging approximately 73 units/period over the last 7 periods (P38-P44). Inventory on-hand is currently 0. In-transit pipeline consists of: P41 order (177 units) expected in P45, P42 order (80 units) expected in P46, and P43 order (126 units) expected in P47. Total in-transit is 383 units. Since the simulation ends at Period 47, any order placed now (P45) would arrive in Period 49 (45+4 lead time), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to satisfy demand using existing in-transit stock while avoiding remaining inventory at the end of P47. The current pipeline of 383 units covers roughly 5.2 periods of demand (383 / 73 \u2248 5.2). With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), the current in-transit stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~220 units (3 * 73). No further orders are needed.",

Recent demand for Periods 38-45 has averaged approximately 70 units per period (69, 67, 109, 61, 55, 64). With a lead time of 4 periods, I need enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods (P46 to P50). Expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 350 units (5 * 70). Current supply includes 113 on-hand and 206 in-transit (80 from P42, 126 from P43), totaling 319 units. The P42 order (80 units) is expected to arrive in P46 conclude, and the P43 order (126 units) in P47 conclude. This pipeline covers most of the expected demand through P50, but leaves a small projected deficit (350 - 319 = 31).

  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its off-season (Late Dec/Early Jan). Recent demand has stabilized in a low-volume winter regime, averaging approximately 76 units/period over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My objective is to maintain enough inventory to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current pipeline: On-hand = 101, In-transit = 226 (consisting of 126 ordered P43, arriving P47; 0 ordered P44/P45; 100 ordered P46, arriving P50). Total inventory available to cover current and upcoming periods is 327 units. At an estimated average demand of 80 units/period (accounting for potential post-holiday fluctuations), 5 periods of demand equals 400 units. Pipeline (327) vs target (400) leaves a gap of 73 units. I will order 100 units to ensure a small safety buffer against seasonal volatility or early spring replenishment demand, while keeping holding costs manageable given the low winter sales.",
