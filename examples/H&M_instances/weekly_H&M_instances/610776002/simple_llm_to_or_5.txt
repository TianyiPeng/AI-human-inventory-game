======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of the provided data [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] indicates a strong upward trend over the last five periods. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a seasonal staple as we move from late winter into early spring (mid-February). The demand has increased significantly in the last two periods (from 160 to 308), showing a growth of approximately 92% over five intervals. Given the current date of February 11th, we are entering the pre-spring shopping season for 'Everyday Basics'. I expect the upward momentum to continue but at a slightly tempered rate as the trend stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Significant upward demand trend identified: demand grew from 148 to 308 over 5 periods (+108% total), shifting the mean from ~160 to ~270 in the most recent two observations.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data showed a strong upward trend peaking at 308 (Period 1 Training). The actual demand for the most recent period (Period 1 Test) was 266, which aligns with the carry-over insight indicating a regime shift toward a higher mean (~270). This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees steady to increasing demand as the spring season approaches in February. Given the recent demand shift from the 150-range to the 230-300 range, and the stability of the 266 observation, the forecast reflects the new higher baseline while accounting for minor variance/stabilization following the initial spike.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend, ending at 308 units. In the test phase, Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316) confirm that demand has stabilized at a higher regime compared to the early training levels. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees consistent or increasing demand as spring approaches in late February. The demand grew by ~18% between the last two observed periods (266 to 316). Given the momentum and the product category's relevance to the season, I expect a slight further increase or stabilization near the recent peak.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt showed a strong upward trend, ending at 308 units. The test phase data (Periods 1-3) confirms a new, higher demand regime, stabilizing between 266 and 316 units (average ~296). Period 1 (2019/2/11) to Period 3 (2019/2/25) shows consistent volume exceeding 260 units. As we move into early March (2019/3/4), the product\u2014a lightweight jersey T-shirt\u2014enters the peak spring transition period in many retail markets, where demand for basics historically remains strong or increases. Given the recent stability around the 300-unit mark and the seasonal relevance of the item, I forecast a slight continuation of this high-demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Established demand plateau: Period 1-3 (Test Phase) confirms a stable high-demand regime averaging ~296 units, validating the shift from the earlier training mean.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) showed a significant upward trend during the training period, rising from 148 to 308. In the current test phase (Periods 1-4), the demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 293 units. The most recent observations (316, 306, 283) show a slight cooling from the peak in Period 2 but remain consistently within the 280-310 range. As of 2019/03/11, we are entering mid-March; for a lightweight jersey T-shirt, this typically aligns with the start of spring fashion cycles in the Northern Hemisphere, supporting sustained demand. Given the slight downward movement in the last two periods (306 to 283), a conservative forecast near the current regime mean is appropriate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a staple item for spring. Analysis of the historical demand shows a significant jump from the training phase (avg ~180) to the test phase. During the first five periods of the test phase (Feb 11 - Mar 11), demand peaked early at 316 and has shown a gradual softening in the most recent two weeks (283 to 252). Period 6 (March 18) coincides with the mid-late March period where spring shopping is generally active but can fluctuate before the Easter peak. Given the downward movement from 316 to 252 (-20% over 3 weeks), a stabilization or slight further decline is expected as initial spring stock-up demand settles, though the mean remains significantly higher than the training period. I estimate a slight stabilization near the recent average.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a significant regime shift from an initial average of ~160 to a high-demand plateau established in the training-to-test transition. Recent data (P1-P6) maintains this higher level with an average of 282 units. While there was a slight dip in P5 (252), P6 (270) indicates stabilization. Given the current date (March 25) coincides with the start of Spring, demand for a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt' is expected to remain strong and potentially increase slightly as temperatures rise. The forecast of 275 reflects the relative stability of the recent three-period average (268) adjusted for seasonal upward pressure.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed an upward trend in the training phase, which stabilized at a higher plateau during the start of the test phase (P1-P3 avg ~296). After a brief cooling in P4-P6 (avg ~268), P7 (3/25) showed a significant spike to 364 units (+35% over P6). This surge aligns with the transition into April, a key month for spring apparel like the 'Tilly' jersey basic T-shirt as weather warms and mid-season shopping cycles begin. Given the strong momentum in P7 and the seasonal relevance of the product, I expect demand to remain elevated, though potentially correcting slightly from the sharp P7 peak as it stabilizes at a new spring level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a stable plateau around ~282 units from Periods 1-6. However, Periods 7 and 8 show a significant upward shift, jumping to 364 and 372 units respectively. This represents a ~30% increase in volume coinciding with the start of April and the spring season, which is highly relevant for a 'lightweight jersey' t-shirt. Given the momentum between Period 7 and 8 (+2%) and the seasonal alignment, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or grow slightly as the weather continues to warm.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (148-308) and test data (Periods 1-6) established a high-demand regime for this basic T-shirt, averaging ~275 units. Periods 7 and 8 showed a significant spike (364, 372), likely driven by the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019) and the transition into spring weather, which favors lightweight jersey basics. Period 9 saw a correction back to 271. Period 10 (April 15-21) is the week of Easter Sunday; while some pre-holiday shopping may have peaked, holiday weeks often see a final surge or maintain high volume due to seasonal transitions. Given the drop in Period 9, I expect a moderate rebound as the actual holiday week commences, aligning with the established high-demand baseline and seasonal relevance.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal spring/Easter spike confirmed: Demand increased by ~35% over the baseline in Periods 7-8 (avg 368 vs previous avg 275).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (148 to 308) and early test periods (1-6) established a high-demand baseline for this 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt, averaging ~282 units. Periods 7 and 8 showed a significant spike (avg 368) attributed to the lead-up to Easter (April 21, 2019). Period 9 (271) showed a post-spike correction, while Period 10 (310) represents the immediate pre-Easter week, likely capturing late holiday shopping. Current Period 11 (2019/4/22) is the week immediately following Easter. Historically, demand for basics tends to normalize after holiday peaks. Given the average performance outside the Easter spike is approximately 280-290, and considering a minor post-holiday cooling effect, a return toward the established baseline is expected.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong baseline demand around 280-300 units for this basic SKU. A seasonal spring spike occurred in Periods 7-8 (avg 368), followed by a brief stabilization near 290. Period 11 (2019/4/22) showed an extreme surge to 564 units, coinciding with the Easter holiday week. Historically, such significant spikes in 'Everyday Basics' are often followed by a sharp correction as the promotional or holiday effect fades, though the broader trend for T-shirts typically remains strong moving into May. I expect demand to drop from the outlier peak of 564 but remain above the early-year baseline due to seasonal relevance.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand volatility: Period 11 recorded a record peak (564 units, +82% over the previous period), suggesting high sensitivity to holiday calendars or mid-season promotional events.

Predicted demand: 385 units

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a growth phase (Periods 1-3) followed by a stable regime (~270 units). Period 7-8 saw an Easter-related spike (~368 units), followed by a massive surge in Period 11 (564 units) and Period 12 (424 units). Period 11 coincided with Easter Monday/late April, and Period 12 remained elevated. These high numbers likely reflect late spring/early summer demand for a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt'. As the date is May 6, we are entering the peak season for basics/summer wear. However, the drop from 564 to 424 suggests the immediate holiday peak is subsiding. I expect demand to stabilize at a higher 'summer baseline' than the early spring baseline, but lower than the anomalous Period 11 peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline shift: Following the April peaks, demand has settled into a higher floor of 400+ units, representing a NEW baseline (~50% higher than the Feb/March average of 270) due to seasonal relevance of jersey t-shirts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this jersey t-shirt shows several regimes: an initial spring baseline (~280-300), a pre-Easter/Spring spike (Periods 7-8), and a significant Easter/Holiday peak (Period 11: 564 units). Following the Easter peak, demand has been correcting downwards (424, then 304). The current date is May 13th, transitioning into the early summer season. While Period 13 dropped to 304, this aligns with a post-holiday stabilization. Looking at the broader trend since late March, the average demand is 372. Jersey basics typically see rising or sustained demand as temperatures increase in May. I expect the downward correction from the April peaks to floor out around the 330-350 range, representing the 'Summer baseline shift' noted in insights, as 304 appears to be a local trough following the massive 564 unit spike.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this jersey t-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we enter the summer season. Recent data highlights high volatility tied to the calendar: a massive spike in Period 11 (564 units, Easter Monday) followed by a correction, and then another significant jump in the most recent Period 14 (431 units). The 'Carry-over Insights' established a new summer baseline of approximately 400+ units. Period 15 aligns with the week before the late May Bank Holiday (UK/Europe context), a period typically associated with pre-holiday apparel shopping for basics. Given the volatile but upward-trending nature of the last 4 weeks (424, 304, 431) and the product's increasing seasonal relevance (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt), I expect demand to remain strong and slightly increase towards the month-end peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a multifaceted pattern: an initial baseline of ~290 (P1-P6), a spring peak (P7-P11) peaking at 564, and a subsequent stabilization into a higher 'Summer baseline'. Recent data (P14-P15) shows a consistent upward movement at 431 and 442 units respectively, confirming the 'Summer baseline shift' noted in Carry-Over Insights (400+ units). As the current date (May 27) approaches June, demand for a lightweight jersey T-shirt usually remains strong due to rising temperatures. The current trend over the last two periods is slightly upward-sloping. Given the lack of major public holidays in late May/early June for this specific period in 2019, I expect demand to maintain its current momentum but stay within the established summer range.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:

Historical demand over the last three periods (14-16) has shown remarkable stability, averaging 436 units (431, 442, 435). This confirms the previously identified summer baseline shift for this lightweight jersey T-shirt as we enter June. Given the product category's high relevance in summer and the lack of immediate holiday disruptions until Period 18 (Whit Monday), I expect demand to remain consistent within this established high-demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Summer plateau stabilization: Periods 14-16 have established a consistent demand range between 431-442 units, confirming the higher summer baseline predicted in Period 13.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this jersey T-shirt shows a clear upward progression: initial training data (avg ~200), early spring (avg ~296), and summer stabilization (avg ~436). The previous period (17) saw a massive spike to 640 units, which aligns with early June seasonal peaks for lightweight basics or potential early summer promotions. However, looking at the pattern of previous spikes (e.g., Period 11's 564 followed by Period 12's 424/13's 304), these surges are often followed by a retracement toward the current baseline rather than maintaining the peak. Given the current date is mid-June, demand should stay elevated above the baseline but likely retreat from the extreme 640 high. I expect a correction toward the 500-unit mark, maintaining the summer surge momentum while accounting for the high volatility seen in similar past spikes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge: Period 17 confirms a secondary seasonal spike (640 units), surpassing the Easter peak (564) and establishing a likely June demand ceiling ~45% above the May baseline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt is currently in its peak summer season. Historically, we saw a stabilization baseline around ~435 units (Periods 14-16) followed by a sharp spike in Period 17 (640 units), likely driven by early June weather or promotions. Period 18 saw a correction back to 419 units, which aligns closely with the established pre-spike baseline. As we are in mid-June (June 17), demand is expected to remain firm but likely stabilize near the current baseline rather than repeating the extreme outlier seen 2 weeks ago. Given the slight cooling from 435 to 419, a forecast near the recent average (excluding the spike) is appropriate.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this Jersey T-shirt shows a clear upward trend as summer progresses. Analysis of the recent baseline (Periods 14-16) showed a stable level around 435 units. Period 17 saw a significant seasonal spike to 640 units (likely related to early June summer shopping), followed by a return to the current baseline in Period 18 (419) and Period 19 (439). For the current date (June 24th), we are in the peak summer season where demand for 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts remains high. The average of the last two periods is 429 units. Given the consistency of the 430-440 range when not peaking, and the approach of July which typically maintains summer demand, I expect demand to remain stable near this established baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear high-season baseline established in May/June averaging between 430-440 units, with periodic spikes (Easter and early June). The drop in Period 20 (301 units) mirrors the correction seen in Period 13 following a major peak. Period 21 (July 1st) enters the heart of the summer season. Given the 'Summer baseline shift' identified in Period 13 and the stabilization observed in Periods 14-16, demand is expected to recover from the temporary Period 20 dip and return toward the established summer floor of ~400+ units. The dip to 301 is treated as a short-term volatility event rather than a regime shift downward, as the product (lightweight jersey T-shirt) remains highly seasonally relevant in July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal peak in June (reaching 640 units), followed by a sharp decline in late June and early July. Specifically, Period 20 (301) and Period 21 (232) indicate a rapid cooling as the primary summer peak fades. The current date (July 8, 2019) places the product in the mid-summer period. For a 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt, demand often stabilizes at a lower but steady level after the initial summer surge. Given the 22.9% drop between Period 20 and 21, I anticipate a further slight cooling or stabilization around the 200-220 range before hitting the late-summer floor. The forecast expects the downward momentum to slow down.

Carry-over insight: Post-Summer peak correction: Period 19-21 shows a sustained downward trajectory (avg decline ~26% per period) from peak levels, returning demand toward early-spring baselines (~250 units).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basic) peaked in early June (Period 17: 640 units) and has since undergone a sharp correction. The carry-over insight from Period 22 identifies a significant downward trajectory. Looking at the most recent three periods (P20: 301, P21: 232, P22: 238), demand has stabilized at a lower floor, roughly matching the initial training and early spring baselines (148-260 range). As we enter mid-July, the peak summer shopping season for basics often transitions into a clearance or late-summer plateau before any back-to-school or transitional shifts. Given the slight stabilization between P21 and P22 (232 to 238), I expect a similar performance for Period 23 as the downward momentum has leveled off around the 235-unit mark.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization of post-peak demand: Following the significant decline from June peaks, demand has found a new floor (Periods 21-22) at approximately 235 units, consistent with early spring levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which saw significant peak demand during the spring and early summer leading up to June. Historical analysis shows a clear peak in June (Period 17: 640 units), followed by a steady decline as the summer peak season fades. The most recent three periods (21, 22, and 23) show demand stabilizing at 232, 238, and 212 units respectively, averaging 227 units. This represents a return to the early spring baseline (late Feb/early March). As we move further into late July (Period 24), there is no immediate calendar event to drive a spike, and the gentle downward drift in the last period (212 units) suggests a slight further cooling of demand as mid-summer shopping concludes and the market awaits late-summer/back-to-school transitions. I predict demand will continue to stay near this established floor but with a minor downward bias.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly seasonal. After reaching a peak of 640 units in early June (Period 17), demand has been on a consistent downward trajectory as the peak summer buying season concludes. Recent observations (Periods 21-24) show demand stabilizing at a lower level: 232, 238, 212, and 207 units respectively. This indicates a return to the early spring baseline (approx. 200-250 units). The last two periods (23 and 24) specifically show a tightening range around 210 units. Given no major retail events are occurring on July 29th for this category, a slight continued softening or stabilization around the 200-unit mark is expected.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-summer floor: Demand has stabilized between 200-240 units for four consecutive periods (21-24), marking the end of the summer peak cycle and a return to base levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a basic jersey T-shirt, which has moved through its primary summer peak (May-June) and is now entering the late summer/early autumn transition. Historical data shows a clear downward trajectory from the June peak (640) down to the most recent period (154). While Periods 21-24 established a floor around 210-230 units, Period 25 (July 29) shows a significant break below that floor, dropping to 154 units (-25% from the previous period). This decline aligns with typical seasonal transitions where summer basics begin to lose momentum in favor of autumn apparel. For Period 26 (Aug 5), demand is expected to remain near this lower level as the summer clearance phase continues. I am forecasting a slight stabilization or incremental decline following the sharp drop in Period 25.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand break: Period 25 indicates a significant drop below the previously established floor (avg 222 units in Periods 21-24 down to 154), marking a transition to late-season clearance levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic t-shirt (610776002) is currently in a strong downward trend as the summer season concludes. Historical data shows demand peaked in June (Period 17: 640) and has steadily declined through July and early August. Specifically, recent observations show a sharp acceleration in this decline: Period 24 (207), Period 25 (154), and Period 26 (102). This represents a week-over-week drop of ~25-34% in the last two periods. As of August 12 (Period 27), we are entering the tail end of the summer season where 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts typically face clearance or reduced seasonal interest. Following the trend of a ~30% decline from the previous period (102), the forecast anticipates a landing near the 70-unit mark.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer liquidation phase: Demand has entered a steep terminal decline phase for the summer season, dropping from a stable floor of ~220 units (Periods 21-24) to 102 units in Period 26, reflecting a weekly contraction rate of over 30%.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline phase as summer comes to a close. After a sustained late-summer floor of ~220 units (Periods 21-24), demand dropped sharply to 154 (Period 25) and then hit a low of 102 (Period 26). The most recent observation (120 in Period 27) shows a slight stabilization after the steep drop, indicating that demand has likely reached its end-of-season baseline. Given the date (August 19), we are in the final weeks of summer clearance. I expect demand to remain in this lower regime (100-130 units) as seasonal relevance continues to fade.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Jersey T-shirt) has exited its peak summer season (Periods 14-19) and subsequent liquidation phase (Periods 25-26). Historical data shows a clear regime change: after hitting a season low of 102 units in Period 26, demand has rebounded for two consecutive periods (120 and 158 units). This suggests that the liquidation dip has passed and demand is settling into a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline. The date 2019/8/26 often correlates with the end of summer sales and a slight uptick in 'back-to-school' or 'basics replenishment' shopping. Period 28 saw a +31% increase from Period 27; I expect this stabilization/slight recovery to continue as demand returns to a sustainable off-peak level before the end of the season.

Carry-over insight: Post-liquidation recovery: Demand has rebounded from a seasonal floor of 102 units (Period 26), growing by ~55% over two weeks to 158 units, establishing a late-season baseline near 150-170 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product completed its summer peak and liquidation cycles, reaching a seasonal low of 102 units in early August. More recently, demand has rebounded and stabilized during late August (Periods 27-29) with values of 120, 158, and 140. For Period 30 (starting Sept 2), demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts typically enters a steady secondary baseline as summer items transition toward early-autumn wardrobe staples. Given the recent average of 149 units over the last two periods and the lack of major upcoming holidays in this specific week, I anticipate demand will remain consistent with this post-liquidation baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product completed its summer peak and liquidation phase (Periods 17-27), followed by a recovery to a new late-season baseline (Period 29). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey t-shirt, which serves as a year-round layering piece but loses primary seasonal momentum in September. The last three periods (29, 30, and 31) show extreme stability with demand values of 140, 145, and 141 respectively. This indicates a very consistent baseline for the current autumn transition period. The average for the last three weeks is 142 units. Considering the date 2019/09/16, there are no immediate retail calendar spikes expected in this specific region/period. Therefore, I forecast a continuation of this stable 140-145 unit floor.

Carry-over insight: Established autumn baseline: Demand has consolidated between 140-145 units for three consecutive periods (29-31), marking a stable post-liquidation floor for the everyday t-shirt category.

In the last four periods (Periods 29-32), demand has been tightly range-bound between 135 and 145 units, establishing a clear autumn baseline. The most recent observation (Period 32) showed a slight softening to 135 units. As we move further into late September (2019/9/23), the seasonal relevance of a lightweight jersey t-shirt remains stable but faces slight downward pressure from cooling temperatures. Given the average of the last four periods is 140, and the subtle downward drift in the most recent week, a forecast slightly below the recent mean is appropriate.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a highly stable autumn baseline following the end-of-summer liquidation phase. Analyzing the recent history (Periods 29-33), demand has fluctuated within a very narrow range: 140, 145, 141, 135, and 147 units. The mean for these five periods is approximately 141.6, with the most recent observation (Period 33) being 147. Calendar-wise, late September/early October (Period 34) represents a period without major retail anomalies for everyday basics, and the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category typically maintains a steady floor during this transition before any late-season or holiday shifts. Given the consistent consolidation around the 140-145 mark and the slight uptick in Period 33, I forecast a continuation of this stable baseline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows an established autumn baseline of ~142 units during Periods 29-33. Period 34 (Sep 30) saw a significant drop to 106 units (-26% from the baseline), which aligns with the seasonal transition into October where demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts typically shifts toward layering or declines in favor of heavier weight apparel. This 106 value is nearly identical to the previous seasonal low of 102 (Period 26), suggesting the product has reached its late-year floor. I expect demand to stabilize around this new lower level for the current period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant downward shift for the 'Tilly' t-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). For Periods 29-33, demand was stable (range 135-147, avg ~142). However, Periods 34 (106) and 35 (85) show a steep departure from this floor, with Period 35 representing a 40% decline from the previous stable range and a 20% decline week-over-week. As of mid-October (2019/10/14), the product\u2014a lightweight jersey t-shirt\u2014is entering late autumn, where seasonal relevance for 'lightweight jersey' typically bottoms out before any potential holiday lift. The current trend suggests demand is searching for a new winter baseline. Applying the recent momentum (approx. -20 units per week), I expect Period 36 to continue this low-demand trend near 75 units.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand contraction: Demand has broken the previous 'autumn floor' of ~140 units (Periods 29-33), falling significantly to an average of 95 units over Periods 34-35 (-33% shift) as seasonal relevance declines.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Tilly' t-shirt has shown a clear seasonal lifecycle, peaking in June (Period 17: 640) and declining steadily through late summer and autumn. Recent periods have demonstrated a significant contraction from the previous autumn floor of ~140 units. Specifically, demand dropped to 106 (Period 34), 85 (Period 35), and 84 (Period 36). The last two observations indicate that demand has stabilized at a new, lower floor of approximately 85 units as the product's seasonal relevance as a lightweight jersey top decreases in late October. Given the stability between Periods 35 and 36, I expect the demand to remain flat at this level.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization of late-autumn floor: Demand has plateaued at ~85 units for two consecutive periods (35-36), confirming a new baseline following the transition from the autumn range of 140-145.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of contraction and stabilization as we move into late autumn. After a drop from the previous 'autumn floor' of ~140 units, demand settled at approximately 85 units for Periods 35 and 36. Period 37 showed a slight uptick to 109 units (a +30% increase from the previous week). Historically, for an everyday basic jersey t-shirt, we are transitioning away from peak seasonal relevance in October. The recent spike to 109 may reflect a small promotional effect or standard variance, but the overarching trend is a stabilization around a lower baseline compared to early autumn. I anticipate a slight regression toward the newly established floor of 85-100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-179.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is seasonally low-demand during late autumn (November). Current Observed Demand shows a clear downward shift from the autumn floor of ~140 units to a late-autumn baseline of approximately 80-100 units. Specifically, Periods 35-38 show demands of 85, 84, 109, and 78. Excluding the slight spike in Period 37, the trend is trending toward the low 80s or high 70s. As we move further into November (unfavorable for lightweight jersey basics), demand is expected to remain at this low-level plateau or slightly decrease until holiday shopping potentially provides a minor lift later in the month. The average of the last four periods is 89, but the most recent observation (Period 38) is 78, suggesting the trend is still softening toward the lower end of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late-autumn floor refinement: Demand has consistently remained below 110 units for four consecutive periods (35-38), establishing a late-season baseline (~89 avg) that is roughly 37% lower than the early-autumn floor (~140).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a steady decline from the mid-autumn floor of ~140 units to a late-autumn baseline of ~89 units. In the most recent period (P39), demand dropped to its lowest seasonal point of 61 units. Given the product is a 'lightweight jersey' t-shirt, its seasonal relevance continues to diminish as we move further into November (Winter transition). While the drop to 61 marks a new low, basic items typically find a terminal floor for layering purposes. I anticipate demand will stabilize near this new low or see a very slight recovery due to early November retail activity (e.g., Singles' Day/pre-Black Friday), leading to a forecast of 68.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for this jersey t-shirt has entered a late-season trough, with the last five periods (36-40) averaging ~80 units, reflecting a decline from the early-autumn floor of 140. Most recently, demand has dipped further, averaging 65 units over the last two weeks (P39-40). The current period (Nov 18-24) is the week immediately preceding Black Friday week. Historically, basic items like t-shirts often see a slight uptick or stabilization during pre-holiday sales events even if they are out-of-season. Given the recent floor established at ~65 but acknowledging the potential for early 'Black Week' promotional lift, I forecast a slight stabilization or marginal increase from the previous week's 69.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand trough: Periods 38-40 have established a lower seasonal floor of ~69 units, a further 22% decline from the previously identified floor of ~89.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the SKU has reached its annual late-autumn trough, averaging approximately 67 units over the last three periods (39-41). However, Period 42 (starting 2019/11/25) encompasses the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping window. As a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey t-shirt, this product is highly susceptible to the sitewide promotional activity characteristic of this retail period. While the seasonal demand for t-shirts is currently low, Black Friday typically drives a significant temporary volume spike for staple items. I am forecasting a substantial uplift from the current trough (approx. 130% increase) to reflect event-driven demand, similar to levels seen during the late-summer recovery phase.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is seasonally low in late autumn/early winter. Historically, demand has been in a sustained decline, establishing a 'trough' floor around 65-70 units (Periods 39-41). However, Period 42 (Nov 25) shows a significant jump to 109 units (+63% from the previous week). This spike aligns with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional window. As the current period is Dec 2, we are in the immediate post-Cyber Monday week. Historically, holiday momentum and early December gift shopping often sustain a slightly elevated level compared to the November trough before dropping off again towards mid-December. I expect demand to moderate slightly from the peak promotion week but remain above the late-November baseline of ~68.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Tilly Jersey T-shirt shows a clear descent from its summer peaks (~640) to a late-autumn baseline. Recent data shows a stable floor between 60-70 units (Periods 39-41, 43), with a notable spike in Period 42 (109 units) corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (November 25, 2019). Moving into Period 44 (December 9, 2019), the immediate post-promotional 'hangover' seen in Period 43 (61 units) is expected to persist, as jersey t-shirts are low-relevance items in mid-winter. While the Christmas shopping season is active, this specific basic jersey item typically sees lower engagement compared to gift-oriented or seasonal-specific categories. I expect the demand to stay consistent with the established winter floor.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Promotional sensitivity confirmed: Period 42 showed a ~63% increase (109 vs avg 67) during the Black Friday window, followed by an immediate return to the late-season floor of ~61 units.

Predicted demand: 65 units

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for this jersey t-shirt has been in a sustained seasonal decline, recently establishing a late-autumn trough. Excluding the Black Friday spike (Period 42: 109), the recent baseline has averaged approximately 63 units across Periods 39-43. However, Period 44 (Dec 9) recorded the lowest demand to date (55 units), suggesting a continued downward drift as the product reaches minimum seasonal relevance in mid-December. While the upcoming period (Dec 16) is the final full week before Christmas, basic jersey t-shirts typically do not experience a significant holiday surge compared to festive or cold-weather categories. I expect demand to remain near the established floor of 55-60 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows the product has entered a winter baseline phase, with demand averaging approximately 60 units over the last three periods (61, 55, 64). Period 46 (starting 2019/12/23) covers Christmas and the start of post-Christmas/Boxing Day sales. While the product is a staple item, previous promotional sensitivity (Black Friday spike to 109) suggests it may see a minor lift from year-end clearance activity starting Dec 26. However, the overall seasonal relevance for a lightweight jersey T-shirt remains at its annual low. I expect demand to remain close to the current baseline with a very slight holiday/clearance-related uptick.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-202.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a stable late-December floor of approximately 60 units (Periods 43-45). Period 46 (Christmas week) saw a significant 50% increase to 92 units, consistent with the holiday/promotional sensitivity previously observed during Black Friday (Period 42). Period 47 (Dec 30 - Jan 5) covers the New Year holiday and the beginning of January clearance sales. While demand is expected to remain above the mid-December floor due to holiday traffic and seasonal promotions, it typically softens slightly compared to the peak Christmas week. Therefore, I forecast a slight moderation from the 92 units seen in Period 46, while staying well above the 60-unit baseline.
