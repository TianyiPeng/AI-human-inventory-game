======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an upward trend over the last five periods (148 to 308). The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, categorized as 'Everyday Basics'. The current date is February 11, 2019. In the retail calendar, mid-February often sees a transition from winter clearance toward spring essentials. Given the recent trajectory (last three periods: 160, 233, 308), there is significant upward momentum. However, a jump from 233 to 308 (+32%) is a sharp increase. I expect the demand to continue growing as spring approaches, but at a slightly more moderated pace to account for potential stabilization after the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand trend confirmed over last 5 periods: increased from 148 to 308 (+108% total growth).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a significant upward trend (148 to 308). The most recent observation (Period 1) came in at 266 units, which is a slight softening from the peak of 308 but still significantly higher than the initial average. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees steady or increasing demand as we move from February into spring. The current date is 2019/2/18, approaching late February when spring shopping begins to accelerate. Given the recent growth trend and the transition into a more favorable season for lightweight jersey tops, I expect demand to stabilize or slightly increase from the Period 1 level.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend ending at 308 units. In the current test phase, demand has remained high and continues to grow (266 to 316). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as the transition from winter to spring begins (late February). The recent growth from Period 1 to Period 2 (+18.8%) suggests the upward momentum is sustained. Given the date (Feb 25), we are entering a seasonal window where lightweight jersey basics gain traction. I expect a continued moderate increase following the established trend line.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as spring approaches. Historical training data showed a strong upward trend (148 to 308). In the current test phase (Periods 1-3), demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 296 units (266, 316, 306). The slight dip from 316 to 306 in Period 3 suggests a stabilization rather than a continued aggressive spike. Given the date (early March), we are entering a peak season for jersey basics. The forecast assumes demand will remain robust and slightly increase as weather warms, aligning with the established higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Average demand has shifted from the initial training mean (~200) to a sustained higher level of ~300 units (+50% shift) over the last 4 periods.

Predicted demand: 325 units

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a significant upward shift from the training mean (~200) to a new regime (~300) during the test phase. Observed test demand for Periods 1-4 was 266, 316, 306, and 283, maintaining an average of 293 units. While there is a slight softening in the last two periods (306 to 283), March typically sees stable or increasing demand for 'Everyday Basics' T-shirts as spring approaches. Given the recent average and the established higher regime, a forecast slightly above the most recent observation but aligned with the current regime average is appropriate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as spring approaches. Historical training data showed a strong upward trend (148 to 308). In the test phase, demand peaked at Period 2 (316) but has shown a steady decline over the last three periods (306 -> 283 -> 252). This decline suggests a cooling off from the initial peak or a temporary stabilization. The current date is March 18, 2019, which is just before the official start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere; while seasonal demand for T-shirts should remain healthy, the immediate trend is downward. I expect the demand to stabilize near the 240-250 range as the initial surge subsides before any potential April spring peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $985.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product has transitioned from a historical training mean of approximately 205 to a higher demand regime in the test phase. Over the last six periods, demand has averaged 282 units. While there was a peak of 316 in Period 2, the demand softened recently, hitting a low of 252 in Period 5 before rebounding to 270 in Period 6. Given the date (late March), we are entering the Spring season, which typically supports stable or increasing demand for basic T-shirts. The forecast accounts for the recent recovery from Period 5 and the seasonal transition, projecting demand to stabilize near the current test-period average.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt showed an initial training climb (148 to 308) followed by a stabilization around a mean of 280-300 units in the early test periods. The last period (Period 7: 364) shows a significant spike (+35% vs. P6). Looking at the calendar, the current date is April 1st (Period 8). This coincides with the transition into Spring, where 'Everyday Basics' like lightweight jersey T-shirts typically see increased seasonal demand as temperatures rise. The jump in Period 7 likely signals the start of this seasonal ramp-up. While P7 was 364, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially stabilize or grow slightly as the season progresses. I am forecasting a slight continuation of this momentum.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal spring ramp-up confirmed: Period 7 saw a 35% increase (to 364 units) compared to the previous 6-period average of ~282, indicating the start of warmer weather demand for jersey basics.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (148-308) showed an initial upward trend. In the test phase, Periods 1-6 established a stable regime around a mean of ~282 units. However, Periods 7 and 8 show a significant upward shift (364 and 372 units), representing a ~30% increase over the previous test average. This aligns with the 'Seasonal spring ramp-up' noted in the Carry-over Insights, as early April (current date 2019/4/8) coincides with rising temperatures and the demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts ('Womens Everyday Basics'). Given the consecutive high readings of 364 and 372, I expect demand to remain in this elevated tier, likely continuing a slight upward trajectory as spring progresses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an initial growth trend (148 to 308). In the test phase, demand stabilized around a mean of ~282 for Periods 1-6. Periods 7 and 8 showed a significant spike (364 and 372 units respectively), coinciding with late March and early April, which aligns with seasonal demand for a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt' as spring begins. However, Period 9 saw a sharp correction back to 271 units. Given the date (April 15), we are in the post-Easter period where retail demand often stabilizes after a spring surge. The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 8 noted the ramp-up, but the most recent data point (Period 9) suggests the extreme peak has passed or was a temporary surge. My forecast predicts a slight recovery from the Period 9 dip but maintains a level closer to the current seasonal average (~300-320) rather than the previous peaks.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has transitioned from a base level of ~200 to a higher regime of ~300. Recently, we observed a seasonal spike in Periods 7 and 8 (averaging 368 units), likely due to the onset of spring. Period 9 saw a significant dip to 271, followed by a recovery to 310 in Period 10 (the week leading up to Easter). The current date is 2019/04/22, which is Easter Monday. Retail demand typically remains strong following a holiday weekend due to 'bridge' days and spring shopping momentum, but often slightly lower than the pre-holiday peak. Given the recent average of the last four periods (328) and the stabilization after the Period 9 dip, a forecast near the current mean is appropriate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial training mean of ~204. In the test phase, demand stabilized around ~285 units for the first six periods. A 'Spring Ramp-up' was identified in Period 7-8 (avg ~368). Period 9-10 saw a temporary dip (avg ~290), likely due to post-peak cooling. However, Period 11 (2019/04/22) experienced a massive spike to 564 units (+82% vs previous period). This spike coincides with the Easter Monday holiday and the transition into late spring/early summer weather, which significantly drives demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirts'. While 564 is an outlier compared to the previous mean, the current date (April 29) remains in a high-demand seasonal window. I expect demand to mean-revert from the holiday peak but remain significantly elevated compared to the early April baseline due to seasonal momentum.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal peak detected at Period 11 (564 units), representing a ~100% increase over the baseline mean, likely driven by Easter/Holiday shopping and rising temperatures.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an initial growth trend, which evolved into a higher demand regime of approximately 300 units. Recent performance in the test phase (Periods 7-12) shows clear seasonal volatility associated with spring and early summer for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. We observed a significant peak in Period 11 (564 units) and Period 12 (424 units), likely driven by the Easter period (April 21st) and warmer weather. Period 12 (April 29) shows a deceleration from the peak as the holiday effect wanes, but demand remains elevated compared to the early-season mean of 280-300. Given the date (May 6), we expect demand to continue normalizing downward from the holiday peak while maintaining a higher seasonal floor. I predict a slight further decrease from 424 to 385 units, reflecting the post-holiday stabilization in early May.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization: Demand declined 25% from the Period 11 peak (564 to 424), establishing a new seasonal baseline for May above 350 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown significant volatility around holiday periods (Easter peak in Period 11 at 564 units). Following that peak, demand has experienced a multi-period normalization: 564 (P11) -> 424 (P12) -> 304 (P13). Period 13 (304 units) has returned the demand to the pre-holiday baseline level (approx. 270-310 units seen in Periods 9-10). The current date (May 13) is a standard spring week with no major retail events. Given the downward trend from the holiday peak, I expect demand to stabilize near the established May baseline. A slight correction upwards from the sharp drop in Period 13 is likely as the product settles into its late-spring mean.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a volatile but generally upward trend as the season progresses into late spring. The training mean was ~205, but recent periods (12-14) have averaged ~386 units. After the Easter peak in Period 11 (564), demand dipped to 304 (Period 13) before surging again to 431 in Period 14. For Period 15 (May 20th), we are in a high-demand window for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (jersey T-shirts) as weather warms. The recent bounce-back from 304 to 431 suggests strong underlying demand. Given the volatility, I expect demand to remain at this higher seasonal baseline, slightly adjusting for the recent upward momentum while acknowledging the variance seen in previous weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we enter the warmer months (May). The initial training mean was ~200, which shifted to ~300 in the early test phase. After a significant Easter peak in Period 11 (564), demand normalized but remained elevated. Recent data from Periods 14 and 15 (431 and 442 units) indicates a new, sustained baseline for late May/early June that is significantly higher than the April average (excluding the spike). Period 16 (May 27) coincides with the Memorial Day holiday in the US and the start of summer weather in many regions, which typically drives demand for jersey basics like T-shirts. Given the slight upward momentum over the last two periods (431 to 442) and the seasonal timing, a slight further increase is projected.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline shift: Demand for Periods 14-15 has stabilized at an average of ~436 units, a 45% increase over the pre-Easter baseline of ~300, confirming a seasonal regime change for the summer months.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a transition from a spring baseline (~300) to a significantly higher summer plateau. Following the Easter peak (P11: 564) and subsequent normalization, demand has stabilized remarkably over the last three periods (P14: 431, P15: 442, P16: 435), averaging 436 units. As of June 3rd, the product (a jersey T-shirt) is in peak seasonal relevance. Given the high stability and lack of immediate calendar shocks for early June, the forecast expects the current summer baseline to persist.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear progression: a baseline of ~282 in early spring, a seasonal step-up to ~330 in April, an Easter peak (564), and a sustained summer baseline of ~436 throughout May. Period 17 (June 3rd) saw a massive spike to 640 units, a 47% increase over the May average. This likely signals the start of the high summer peak or a major June promotional event. Following the pattern of the previous major peak in Period 11 (which saw a 25% drop the following week), I anticipate demand will remain significantly elevated compared to the May baseline but will likely experience a slight post-spike stabilization. A forecast of 585 reflects a transition from the initial surge of 640 toward a higher June plateau.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we enter the summer season. The training mean was ~205, which shifted to a baseline of ~300 in early spring, and further increased to a summer baseline of ~436 (Periods 14-16). Period 17 saw a massive spike to 640 units (likely a peak summer promotion or early June heatwave), followed by a 35% normalization to 419 units in Period 18. This 419 figure aligns perfectly with the established summer baseline of ~430-440. Given the date (June 17), we are in the peak of summer demand for lightweight jersey basics. I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase from the last period as it settles into the mid-summer plateau, avoiding the extreme volatility of Period 17 but staying well above the May average.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak established: June Period 17-18 show high volatility with a new local average of ~530, though the sustained baseline remains ~435 (+50% vs spring).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this jersey T-shirt shows a clear seasonal progression: an initial spring baseline of ~300 units shifted to a summer baseline of ~435 units starting in mid-May (Periods 14-16). In June, demand has remained robust but volatile. Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640 units, followed by stabilization in Periods 18 (419) and 19 (439). The current date, June 24, represents the peak of the summer season in the northern hemisphere, where demand for lightweight basics is at its maximum. Given the stability of the last two periods (avg ~429) and the established summer baseline of ~435-440, I expect demand to remain consistent with this level, potentially showing a slight upward tick as schools break and vacation travel increases.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic jersey T-shirt has shown a strong seasonal increase throughout the spring and summer, establishing a baseline of approximately 435 units during May and June (Periods 14-16). While Period 17 saw a massive peak (640 units), Period 20 showed a significant drop to 301 units, which is a 31% decrease from the summer average. This drop mimics the fluctuation seen in Period 13 (304 units) before the summer demand stabilized. Given that Period 21 begins on July 1st, a date typically associated with peak summer retail activity and the start of seasonal sales, demand is expected to recover from the Period 20 trough toward the established summer baseline, though tempered by the recent volatility. I am forecasting a return toward the ~380-400 range.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong summer regime (Periods 14-19) with a baseline average of ~435 units and peaks exceeding 600. However, the last two periods (P20-P21) have shown a sharp and sudden decline from 439 to 301 (-31%) and then to 232 (-23%). This suggests a significant seasonal transition or the end of a high-demand summer cycle for this basic T-shirt. Period 22 (July 8) typically marks a post-peak summer retail phase. I expect the downward trend to continue but decelerate as demand approaches the early-year baseline (approx. 200-250). The forecast reflects a continued but milder decrease from the previous week's 232 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear shift in demand regimes. After a sustained summer baseline of ~435 units (Periods 14-19), demand has dropped significantly over the last three weeks. Periods 21 and 22 have stabilized at a much lower level (232 and 238 respectively), representing a nearly 50% decline from the June average. This likely signals the end of the peak summer buying season for basic jersey T-shirts as retailers transition toward late-summer clearance or early autumn inventory. Given the stability between P21 and P22, I expect demand to remain at this new lower baseline for Period 23.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed for July: Demand has dropped from the summer baseline of ~435 to a new mid-summer level of ~235 units (-45% shift) over the last 3 periods (P20-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has entered a significant downward trajectory following the peak summer periods of June. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has dropped from the ~430-500 unit range to a consistent lower regime. Specifically, the last three observations (232, 238, 212) show a stabilization around a new mean of ~227 units. This represents a -45% shift from the previous summer baseline, likely due to the mid-to-late July seasonal transition where summer basic replenishment slows down before back-to-school or autumn transitions. Period 23 (212 units) is the lowest in the current sequence, suggesting the floor has not yet been definitively reached but momentum is still slightly bearish. I expect demand for Period 24 to stay within this new lower regime, potentially seeing a slight further softening or stabilizing near the current level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this basic jersey T-shirt. After a significant summer peak in June (averaging ~435-530 units), demand entered a sharp decline in July. The last four periods (P21-P24) demonstrate a sustained lower demand regime, with values of 232, 238, 212, and 207. This indicates that the mid-summer drop-off is stabilizing as the market moves past the peak summer shopping window. The average of the last two periods is 209.5, with a slight downward momentum. Given the late July date (2019/7/29), demand is expected to remain at this new late-summer baseline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt) is currently experiencing a significant downward trend as the peak summer season concludes. Following a mid-summer baseline of ~235 units (P20-P24), Period 25 (July 29) saw a sharp decline to 154 units, a 25% drop from the previous week and the lowest level recorded since the initial training period. This suggests the product is entering a late-summer/pre-fall cooling phase where lightweight jersey basics see reduced interest. My forecast for Period 26 (August 5) anticipates a continuation of this lower demand regime, stabilizing near the P25 level as the market transitions out of high-summer sales.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend acceleration: Demand has dropped from a mid-summer average of ~235 units to 154 units in Period 25 (-34%), returning to baseline levels seen in the early training periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for this jersey t-shirt. After peaking in June (Period 17 at 640 units), demand has undergone a significant and sustained decline as the summer season concludes. Recent observations show a steep downward trajectory: Period 24 (207), Period 25 (154), and Period 26 (102). The drop from P25 to P26 represents a 33% decrease, reaching levels below the initial training baseline. For Period 27 (August 12), I anticipate the demand to continue its descent toward a seasonal trough, though the rate of decline may begin to decelerate as it approaches a minimum baseline for a 'basics' item.

Carry-over insight: August trough confirmed: Demand has fallen for 3 consecutive periods (P24-P26) to a new low of 102 units, marking a -50% shift from the July average of ~210 and signifying the end of the summer seasonal cycle.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand peaked in late spring/early summer (Period 17: 640 units) and has been in a sustained decline since July. Recent demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, with Periods 26 and 27 recording 102 and 120 units respectively, significantly lower than the July average of ~210. This confirms the 'August trough' noted in the carry-over insights. As the date is August 19th, we are still in the late-summer clearance/low-demand phase for 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts before back-to-school or transitional autumn trends might emerge. Given the slight uptick from 102 to 120 in the last period, a stabilization around this 110-120 floor is expected for Period 28.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product has transitioned through its late summer trough (P26: 102 units) and is currently in a recovery phase. Demand has increased for two consecutive periods (P27: 120, P28: 158). Historically, this 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt maintains a baseline between 200-300 units during non-peak periods (as seen in Feb/March). The current date (Aug 26) aligns with the end of the summer season and the start of the 'Back to School' period, which typically drives a modest resurgence in basic apparel categories. Given the accelerating upward momentum (+18 then +38 units), I project a continued increase towards the previous baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-trough recovery confirmed: Demand has increased for 3 consecutive periods (P26-P28) from the seasonal low of 102 to 158 (+55% recovery), indicating the end of the August trough and a return toward baseline levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' jersey t-shirt is currently in a post-trough recovery phase after reaching a seasonal low of 102 units in early August (Period 26). Following the peak summer season (where demand averaged ~435 units), demand plummeted throughout July and August. Recent performance (Periods 27-29) shows a stabilizing recovery with values of 120, 158, and 140. Period 30 (September 2nd) coincides with the 'Back to School' season and the transition into autumn, where basic layering pieces like jersey t-shirts typically see a moderate, steady demand before the colder months. Given the slight dip in Period 29 from Period 28, I expect demand to plateau or see a minor increase as the market stabilizes at this new post-summer baseline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this jersey T-shirt has completed its seasonal cycle, falling from summer peaks of 400-600 units to a trough in August (102 units). Since then, we have observed a 'post-trough recovery' as noted in previous insights. Specifically, the last three periods (P28-P30) have stabilized with demands of 158, 140, and 145, averaging 147.6 units. This level aligns closely with the product's initial baseline seen in the training data (P1-P3: 148, 175, 160). As we are now in early September, the demand is expected to remain steady at this non-seasonal baseline for everyday basics. My forecast is based on the average of the most recent stable three-period window.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the significant August trough (Period 26-27: 102-120 units), the demand saw a brief recovery to 158 in Period 28 but has since settled into a highly stable plateau. For the last three consecutive weeks (Periods 29, 30, and 31), demand has remained tightly clustered at 140, 145, and 141 units respectively. This indicates a new post-summer baseline for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt as the season transitions into mid-September. The forecast for Period 32 anticipates a continuation of this stable trend around the current 3-week average of 142 units.

Carry-over insight: New post-summer baseline: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~142 units over the last 3 periods (P29-P31), representing a consistent plateau following the August seasonal trough.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for the 'Tilly' T-shirt shows a clear seasonal cycle, peaking in spring and summer and hitting a seasonal low in August. Demand has since stabilized into a post-summer baseline. Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has been very consistent, recording 140, 145, 141, and 135 units respectively, which results in a four-week average of approximately 140. Given the late September date (2019/9/23), we are firmly in the autumn transition where demand for lightweight jersey basics typically remains steady at a lower baseline compared to summer. There is no evidence of a further decline or a significant recovery at this stage. Therefore, the forecast for Period 33 maintains this established plateau.

As of September 30th, the transition into autumn typically keeps basic jersey items like this T-shirt at a steady, lower volume compared to the summer peaks, often used for layering. Given the lack of recent volatility and the absence of upcoming major retail events in the immediate forecast window, the forecast anticipates a continuation of this stable baseline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle: a spring ramp-up peaking in April/May, a sustained summer plateau through June, a sharp decline in July, and an August trough around 100-120 units. Following a recovery to a stable September baseline of approximately 142 units (P29-P33 average), Period 34 showed a significant drop to 106 units. Given the date is October 7th, demand for this 'lightweight jersey' T-shirt is expected to remain low or continue to decline as colder weather sets in. The forecast for Period 35 anticipates demand staying near the recent low established in Period 34, aligning with the late-autumn seasonal shift away from summer basics.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' lightweight jersey T-shirt has entered a significant downward trend as the season transitions into mid-October. After a period of stability around 140 units (Periods 29-33), demand dropped to 106 in Period 34 and further to 85 in Period 35. This represents a ~40% decline from the September baseline, likely driven by the shift toward colder autumn weather which reduces consumer interest in lightweight summer basics. The forecast for Period 36 anticipates a continued but slightly moderated decline as demand approaches a seasonal floor for the winter months.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has entered a new lower regime as we progress into late October. Historically, the product maintained a post-summer baseline of approximately 142 units (Periods 29-33). However, starting in Period 34 (Sept 30), demand began a sharp contraction: 106, 85, and 84 units respectively. This represents a ~40% drop from the September plateau, likely driven by the transition to colder weather which reduces standalone demand for lightweight jersey basics. Periods 35 and 36 show stabilization at this lower level (85 and 84). Given the consistency of the last two observations and the seasonal context of late October, I forecast demand to remain stable near this current floor.

Carry-over insight: New late-autumn demand regime: Average demand has shifted from the post-summer plateau (~142) to a lower baseline of ~92 units (-35% shift) over the last 3 periods (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' lightweight T-shirt has entered a late-autumn regime as identified in the carry-over insights, shifting from a September plateau of ~142 units to a lower baseline of ~92 units. Observations over the last four periods (106, 85, 84, 109) confirm this lower activity level, though Period 37 showed a slight uptick to 109 units. Given the seasonal context of late October (2019/10/28) where demand for lightweight jersey basics typically remains low before any potential holiday or winter layering spikes, the forecast expects demand to remain near the established regime mean of ~92-100 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight Tilly T-shirt has entered a late-autumn trough, consistent with cooling temperatures in November. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has transitioned from a post-summer plateau of ~142 to a new lower regime averaging approximately 92 units (106, 85, 84, 109, 78). The most recent observation of 78 units represents the lowest point in this regime, reflecting the seasonal decline for jersey basics before any late-November holiday or Black Friday lift. Given the current date of November 4th, demand is expected to remain stable within this lower baseline range until holiday shopping commences.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant downward trend following the summer peak. The demand for this jersey basic T-shirt has transitioned from a mid-summer average of ~235 (P20-22) to an August trough of ~102, then stabilized around ~142 in September. In October, a new late-autumn regime was established at ~92 units. Most recently, demand has continued to slide: 109, 78, and 61 units over the last three periods. The drop from 78 to 61 (-22%) suggests that as temperatures fall in November, demand for lightweight jersey basics is hitting new annual lows. Although November 11 is 'Singles' Day', which can trigger retail spikes, the product category (basic T-shirt) is counter-seasonal for late autumn. Therefore, I anticipate demand will either stabilize near the recent low or continue a slight decline before any potential Black Friday lift.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into late autumn/winter. After the post-summer plateau of ~142 units, a new regime was established around ~92 units (Periods 34-37). Recent observations for Periods 38-40 (78, 61, 69) indicate a further drop to a new seasonal floor. The average of the last three periods is approximately 69.3 units. As the current date (Nov 18) precedes Black Friday week (Nov 29 in 2019), demand is expected to remain low and stable at this new winter baseline before any potential holiday sales impact in the following period.

Carry-over insight: New winter demand floor confirmed: Demand has shifted from the late-autumn average of ~92 to a lower baseline of ~69 units (-25% shift) over the last 3 periods (P38-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal decline from summer peaks (approx. 530 units) to a winter floor. Recent demand from Period 39 to 41 has stabilized around a mean of 66 units (61, 69, 67), confirming the 'winter demand floor' identified in previous carry-over insights. However, the current period (Period 42) begins on November 25, 2019, which coincides with the Black Friday retail week (Nov 29). For a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey t-shirt, this typically results in a promotional spike. While the seasonal trend is at its nadir, I anticipate a moderate uplift of approximately 40-50% above the current 66-unit baseline due to holiday shopping activity.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (a basic jersey T-shirt) reached a winter floor average of ~69 units between Periods 38 and 41. Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a significant increase to 109 units (+63%), coinciding with the Black Friday retail window. Period 43 (Dec 2) includes Cyber Monday and the start of the December holiday shopping season. While Black Friday typically represents the primary peak, Cyber Monday and general holiday momentum usually sustain demand above the November floor but below the peak week. Given the product's classification as an 'Everyday Basic', I expect a slight normalization from the Black Friday spike while remaining elevated relative to the pre-promotion winter baseline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU follows a strong seasonal pattern, with a winter floor established between Periods 38-41 averaging approximately 69 units. Period 42 saw a temporary spike to 109 units, coinciding with the week of November 25th (Black Friday), but Period 43 immediately returned to the baseline level with 61 units. For Period 44 (December 9th), demand is expected to remain within this established winter regime. As a lightweight jersey T-shirt, it is currently in its seasonal low period. Based on the return to the baseline in the most recent period and the lack of upcoming major drivers for this specific category in early December, the forecast aligns with the 5-period winter average excluding the Black Friday outlier.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is currently in its seasonal winter trough. After the 'Winter demand floor' was established at ~69 units (Period 41), we saw a significant spike in Period 42 (109 units) corresponding to Black Friday. Following that, demand returned to baseline levels and slightly below, with 61 and 55 units in Periods 43 and 44 respectively. Period 45 (starting Dec 16) covers the final full shopping week before Christmas. While this item is a summer basic, 'Everyday Basics' often see a minor lift during high-traffic retail weeks. I expect demand to stabilize or slightly recover from the Period 44 low of 55 toward the established winter baseline of ~60-65 units due to general holiday shopping activity.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this jersey t-shirt follows a strong seasonal pattern, peaking in summer and hitting a seasonal floor in winter. Recent data from Period 43-45 shows a very stable demand floor averaging approximately 60 units (61, 55, 64). The current period (Period 46) covers the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). While general retail sees a spike during this time, basic lightweight jersey items typically experience only a marginal lift compared to seasonal gift categories. Given the confirmed 'winter demand floor' of ~69 units from Period 41 and the immediate three-period average of 60, I expect demand to remain near this floor with a slight holiday-related uptick or stabilization. I am forecasting 65 units, reflecting the current baseline with a minimal holiday adjustment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a winter demand floor of approximately 69 units established in November (Periods 38-41). Recent demand in December fluctuated from 55 (P44) and 64 (P45) to a holiday peak of 92 (P46) during the week of Christmas. Period 47 (Dec 30) covers the New Year transition. Following the holiday spike in P46, demand typically undergoes a post-Christmas normalization. Given the product's nature as a jersey basic, it is expected to retreat from the holiday peak back toward the winter baseline, though potentially remaining slightly elevated due to end-of-year clearance or New Year shopping activity. I am forecasting a regression toward the mid-70s.
