Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt). History shows a clear upward trend in demand over the last 5 periods [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. The most recent demand (308) is significantly higher than the initial average. Given the product is an 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt and the date is mid-February, we are likely entering a pre-spring ramp-up. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning we must cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). To respond to the recent demand surge, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher volume (avg ~233) rather than the long-term average. Lead time is set to default as we have no observed arrivals yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] followed by an actual demand of 266 in Period 1. The average of the last 3 samples is approximately 269. The promised lead time is 2, and we placed an order of 356 units in Period 1. Since lead time is 2, we do not expect arrivals until Period 3 or 4 (observed in Period 4 or 5). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 356 in-transit. Because the product is an everyday basic and demand is trending significantly higher than the early historical mean (~160), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the higher volume regime (approx 270 units/period). Setting L to 'default' (2 periods) means mu_hat will cover (1+2)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's basic T-shirt. Current demand history [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266, 316] shows a significant upward shift starting around Period 4. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 280 units, compared to the initial 160. Period 2 conclude confirms an actual lead time of 1 period for the Period 1 order, which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, to remain conservative and cover the review period plus potential lead time variability, I am setting L=1 (as observed) and using the recent 4 periods of demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent higher demand regime while maintaining a buffer against stockouts. On-hand is low (40) and the pipeline (331) is expected to arrive in Period 3 resolution based on the L=1 observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 4: average demand increased from ~160 to ~280 (+75%). Actual lead time observed as 1 period (P1 order arrived P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey' (SKU 610776002) has shifted significantly. Initial demand (approx. 160) was a prior, but actual realized demand over Periods 1-3 has been 266, 316, and 306 (avg ~296), indicating a much higher baseline as we enter March (Spring season for basics). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 568 units in transit (331 from P2, 237 from P3). Although promised lead time is 2, the P1 order arrived in 1 period. However, the P2 order did not arrive in Period 3 (which would be lead_time 1), suggesting lead time is variable or reverting to the promised 2. I will set L to 2 to be conservative. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new demand regime (~296/period). The OR backend will calculate base stock for (L+1)=3 periods (~888 units). With 568 in transit, the backend will order approximately 320 units, which is appropriate given the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-3 average demand is 296, significantly higher than initial history. Lead time is volatile (P1 took 1 period, P2 taking at least 2).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand was [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], but the last four periods show a sustained higher regime: [266, 316, 306, 283], averaging 292.75. This represents a ~75% increase over the initial history. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. Regarding lead time: P1 arrived in P2 (L=1), but the orders from P2 (due P4) and P3 (due P5) have not arrived yet. Since P2's order is now overdue based on the L=1 observation but within the promised L=2, and considering the pipeline is currently 908 units with 0 on-hand, I will use the promised lead time (L=2) to calculate the base stock. The high pipeline relative to demand suggests the OR backend will moderate the order size, but we must ensure mu_hat reflects the new demand level of ~293 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 1: Average demand increased from ~160 to ~293 (+83%) based on 4 periods of consistent data (P1-P4). Lead time is unstable: P1 took 1 period, but P2 is taking at least 2 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday T-shirt. Historical demand (148-308) shifted significantly upward starting Period 1. The average demand across P1-P5 is 284.6, compared to the initial history mean of 204.8. Lead time is highly unstable: P1 took 1 period, P2 took 3 periods (arrived P5), and P3/P4 orders (237 and 340 units) are currently in-transit. P3 is now overdue (3 periods passed). Given the stockout in P3/P4 and the volatility, I will set L to 3 (the longest observed lead time) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher regime (avg ~285). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand level. This approach protects against lead time extensions while acknowledging the sustained demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed unstable (observed: 1 period and 3 periods). Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: mean increased from 205 to 285 (+39%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, and we are currently in late March (Period 7), moving into the spring season. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: initial demand (P-5 to P-1) averaged 184, but since Period 1, the demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 282 over the last 6 periods [266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270]. Lead times have shown significant volatility: P1 took 1 period, P2 took 3 periods, P3 is potentially lost (ordered P3, still not arrived by P6 conclude), and P4 took 2 periods (promised). Given this instability, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for potential delays seen in P2 and P3. For demand, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable higher demand regime (avg ~282) rather than the lower pre-game history. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand, providing a buffer against the observed lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 3 (ordered 2019/2/25) is likely lost; it has not arrived as of Period 6 conclude despite a promised lead time of 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context: The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand in the game periods (P1-P7) shows a significant shift compared to the initial seed data, averaging ~293 units/period vs the initial ~205. Recent demand (P7) hit 364, suggesting a potential spring seasonality peak as we enter April. Lead time analysis: P1 took 1 period, P2 took 3, P4 took 2. The order from P3 (237 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it is lost. Inventory status: We have 0 on-hand and 893 in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7). To account for the lost shipment and potential spring surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (the entire game history regime) to capture the higher mean. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised) as the average of successful arrivals (1, 3, 2) is 2. The OR engine will subtract the 893 in-transit (which includes the lost 237) from the base stock. By maintaining L=2 and high mu, we ensure enough is ordered to cover the gap left by the lost P3 units.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 3 order (237 units) has failed to arrive after 5 periods and is removed from reliable pipeline expectations.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, an everyday basic. Recent demand (Periods 7 and 8) has spiked significantly to 364 and 372 units, compared to the previous average of ~285. This suggests a seasonal uptick as the calendar moves into April (Spring/Summer transition). The mean demand over the last 8 periods is ~306, but the last two periods suggest a higher regime (~368). The order from Period 3 (237 units) is confirmed lost, so the pipeline only consists of orders from P7 (323 units) and P8 (45 units), totaling 368 units in-transit. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with 2 and 3 being common. To account for the recent demand surge and the risk of stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 3 of the last 4 periods), I am setting mu_hat using a recent window that captures the higher demand regime (N=3) and setting lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (approx 2.2 periods) rather than just the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 7: Demand increased from ~285 to ~368 (+29%) over the last two periods, likely due to spring seasonality for basic jersey T-shirts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 10, April 15. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically experiences a seasonal upswing in spring. Recent demand history shows a shift: Periods 1-6 averaged ~282 units/period, while Periods 7-9 averaged ~336 units/period (despite stockouts suppressing visible demand in Periods 7 and 9). The stockout in Period 9 (0 sold vs 271 demand) and Period 7 (149 sold vs 364 demand) confirms that actual demand is higher than realized sales. Lead times are volatile: 1, 3, 2, 3, and 2 periods have been observed. The Period 3 order (237 units) is confirmed lost. In-transit inventory (738 units) consists of orders from P7 (323), P8 (45), and P9 (133). I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand spring regime (averaging ~335 per period across L+1=3 periods). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=6 to capture the volatility since the first major regime shift while excluding the very early low-demand history. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to account for the average realized lead time (2.2 periods) rather than just the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand confirmed: Periods 7-9 show a higher demand regime (avg ~336) compared to Periods 1-6 (avg ~282). Stockouts in Periods 7 and 9 highlight that realized sales are significantly undercounting true demand.

The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand spring regime (Periods 7-10 avg demand ~330), which is significantly higher than the initial history. Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 738 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, and P9). Specifically, the P7 order (323 units) was expected to arrive in P9 (L=2) or P10 (L=3), but has not yet appeared in a 'conclude' message. Given the history of lead time variability (L=1 to L=3) and a confirmed lost shipment in P3, there is a risk that the P7 shipment is also delayed or lost. However, the OR backend logic is capped based on pipeline inventory. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the current demand spike and potential stockouts, I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the higher spring demand (approx 330/period). Over 3 periods (L+1), this totals 990 units. With 738 in-transit, this should trigger a replenishment order to bridge the gap and account for the high stockout risk seen in the last 4 periods where ending inventory was consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime confirmed: Periods 7-10 average demand is ~330, a ~15% increase over the P1-P6 average (~284). Potential delay or loss of Period 7 order (323 units) noted as it has not arrived by Period 10 conclude (L=3 reached).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in high demand due to spring seasonality. Demand in Period 11 spiked to 564, significantly higher than the previous spring average (~330). This indicates a possible acceleration in demand as we enter May. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling all 178 units that arrived in Period 11. Pipeline inventory (884 units) consists of Period 7 (323 units, now 5 periods old), Period 11 (324 units), and an unknown quantity from Period 10 (though the history shows 0 ordered in P10). The Period 7 order is highly likely lost (L=5, promised L=2). To compensate for the high demand and the lost shipment, I am shifting to an explicit forecast. I will use a mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~450 per period (the average of the recent high-demand regime and the recent spike) multiplied by (1+L). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 450 = 1350. I will keep L at default (2) for the OR engine but anticipate high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 11 (564 units), confirming a high-growth spring seasonal trend. Period 7 order (323 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively confirmed lost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is in its peak spring/early summer seasonal window. Recent demand confirms a significant upward regime shift: the average demand in Periods 11-12 is 494 units, compared to the early spring average (Periods 7-10) of ~330. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods, indicating realized sales are far below true demand. Lead times are highly variable (observed: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 periods) and shipments are frequently lost (Period 3 and Period 7 orders). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays and the risk of stockouts during the lead time. I will set mu_hat to 1976 (explicit), calculated as (1+L) * 494, to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to account for both demand volatility and the high uncertainty in shipment reliability.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 11: Average demand increased to ~494 units (+50% vs previous regime) as the season transitions into late spring. Reliability issues persist: Period 7 order (323 units) is confirmed lost after 6 periods of non-arrival.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13, transitioning into the peak summer season for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Demand history shows a significant shift starting around Period 11, with the last three periods (P11-P13) averaging 430.6 units\u2014a substantial increase over the early spring average of ~285. While P13 (304 units) was lower than the P11 spike (564 units), the overall trend remains elevated and volatile as temperatures rise. Inventory is currently 0 with a significant pipeline of 2145 units, although 560 of those units (from P3 and P7) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR engine needs to cover the L+1 window (3 periods) at the new higher demand regime to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in the late spring spike.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 11: average demand increased to ~430 units (+50% vs early spring) as the season transitions into summer peak for jersey basics. Pipeline integrity remains an issue: 560 units (Orders P3 and P7) are confirmed lost and should be discounted from manual pipeline projections.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019, entering the peak summer season for women's jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a high regime; the last four periods (P11-P14) show an average demand of 430.75 units, significantly higher than earlier periods. Despite recent stockouts due to high demand and historical shipment losses (P3 and P7 orders), the pipeline is currently very heavy with 1,821 units in-transit (primarily from large orders in P12 and P13 totaling 1,261 units). Observed lead times consistently fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods. To account for this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the longer replenishment cycle. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand summer regime (approx. 430 units/period * 4 periods = 1720). sigma_hat is set to default to allow for standard volatility. The OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent over-ordering given the massive pipeline already in transit, helping to avoid excessive holding costs if multiple shipments arrive simultaneously.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed: Periods 11-14 average demand is 431 units. Actual lead time is frequently 3 periods, deviating from the promised 2.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27), entering the peak summer season for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Demand analysis indicates a high-growth regime starting Period 11; the average demand for Periods 11-15 is 433 units (excluding the outlier 564 in P11, it is still ~400+). However, stockouts in Periods 11-14 mean realized demand significantly underrepresents true demand. I will estimate the mean demand (mu_hat) based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this summer peak. Lead time (L) has been volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods (P2, P5, P8, P11 all took 3 periods, while P13 took 2). Given this inconsistency and the confirmed loss of 560 units (P3 and P7 orders), I will use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent delays. Sigma_hat is set using N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen during the recent demand spikes and stockout periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime sustained: average demand for Periods 11-15 is ~433 units, with actual demand likely higher due to frequent stockouts. Lead time remains volatile but frequently settles at 3 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in its summer peak demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the average demand is approximately 433 units, though this is likely a conservative estimate due to frequent stockouts (ending inventory was 0 in 4 out of the last 6 periods). The order from Period 12 (631 units) is now 5 periods overdue and should be treated as lost, which severely impacts the effective pipeline inventory. Actual observed lead times recently have been 1, 2, and 3 periods, indicating high volatility. To ensure availability during this high-demand summer period and compensate for the lost shipment and stockout risk, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average of ~435 units per period. Setting L=3 (explicit) reflects the realistic upper bound of the recent arrival patterns to help the OR engine calculate a more robust base stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the high volatility of the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 12 order (631 units) is now 5 periods overdue (L=5) and is confirmed lost; total confirmed lost units (P3, P7, P12) now stand at 1191 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is currently in its summer peak season (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt). Demand has significantly accelerated, with Period 17 demand reaching 640 units despite on-hand stockouts. The demand regime from Period 11 onwards averages ~460 units, but recent spikes suggest a higher mean is necessary to prevent lost sales. On-hand inventory is 0, and the current 'In-transit' of 1879 units includes 1191 units from three confirmed lost orders (Period 3: 237, Period 7: 323, Period 12: 631). Discounting these, the effective pipeline is 688 units (Orders from P16 and P17). Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability during this peak, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for recent delays and using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer demand (~460-500 units/period). This aggressive stance is required to bridge the gap created by historical losses and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime sustained: Periods 11-17 show an average demand of ~463 units, with a notable peak of 640 units in Period 17. Effective pipeline inventory is only 688 units due to 1191 units being confirmed lost across Periods 3, 7, and 12.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in its peak summer season. Demand for Periods 11-18 shows a sustained high regime with an average of approximately 463 units, including peaks up to 640. Stockouts in Period 17 and 18 indicate that current demand is likely higher than recorded sales. Lead time remains highly volatile, with recent arrivals occurring at 1, 2, and 3 periods, while several older orders (P3, P7, P12) totaling 1191 units are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 2034, but after subtracting the 1191 lost units, the reliable pipeline is only 843 units (Orders from P16, P17, P18). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window (3-4 periods of demand), I am setting L=3 to account for frequent delays and using recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the high summer demand regime (approx 463/period). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the high volatility seen during this peak period. This aggressive setting helps the system compensate for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime sustained: average demand for Periods 11-18 is ~463 units. Reliable pipeline inventory is significantly lower than reported due to 1191 units confirmed lost (Orders P3, P7, P12).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). The SKU is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in peak summer demand. Historical data from Period 11 onwards confirms a sustained high-demand regime with an average demand of approximately 460 units per period (P11-P19), despite frequent stockouts masking the true demand ceiling. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Reported in-transit is 1596 units, but this includes 1191 units from confirmed lost orders (P3: 237 units, P7: 323 units, P12: 631 units). The reliable pipeline consists only of orders from P17 (250 units) and P18 (155 units), totaling 405 units. Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I am setting L=3 to account for the upper end of observed arrivals and ensure the base stock covers the extended lead time. To address the severe under-ordering caused by the OR engine counting lost units as 'in-transit', I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I forecast demand at 460 units/period. For a (L+1) horizon (3+1=4 periods), the required coverage is 1840 units. Given the OR engine subtracts the 'in-transit' (1596) from the base_stock, I set mu_hat to 1840 to force an order that bridges the gap created by the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to capture the higher volatility of the summer regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a summer-relevant 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Demand has been in a high regime since Period 11, averaging ~440 units/period (P11-P20). However, the system reports 2001 units 'In-transit', which includes 1191 units from orders P3, P7, and P12 that are confirmed lost. Additionally, the Period 17 order (250 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting further reliability issues or a lead time shift to L=4. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (2001 units) from the target base stock. To ensure an order is placed despite this inflated pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Target inventory for (L+1) periods (where L=3) at 440 units/period is 1760. To offset the ~1191 lost units and the possible loss of P17 (250 units), I will set mu_hat to 3200. This calculation [1760 + 1191 + 250] forces the backend to recognize the need for physical stock. I set L to 3 to reflect the frequent actual lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12) total 1191 units; Period 17 order (250 units) is 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Effective pipeline is only ~410-660 units. Summer demand regime (P11-P20) average is 440 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is the heart of the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics - Jersey Basic T-shirts'. Historical demand for the summer regime (starting Period 11) has averaged ~420 units per period. However, we have experienced frequent stockouts (Periods 17, 18, 20, 21), meaning the actual latent demand is higher than the recorded sales. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Specifically, orders from Period 3 (237 units), Period 7 (323 units), Period 12 (631 units), and now Period 17 (250 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 1,441 phantom units in the 'In-transit' figure of 2,815. This leaves an effective pipeline of only ~1,374 units. Lead times for successful arrivals oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, making L=3 a safer planning horizon. Since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and the effective pipeline is stretched thin across multiple future periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the high-demand summer regime (avg ~420 * (1+L)), and using an explicit L of 3 to account for the frequent delays. This will signal the OR engine to increase order volume to compensate for the lost stock and meet the peak seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments total 1,441 units (P3, P7, P12, and now P17 at L+4). Summer demand regime (P11-P21) actual demand is estimated at ~430 units/period, despite stockout-suppressed sales data. Actual lead time frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Women's Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer season, though recent demand observations (P20-P22: 301, 232, 238) suggest a cooling off or stockout-driven variance compared to the P11-P19 average (~450). On-hand inventory is 731 following the arrival of P21's order (969 units) in only 1 period. However, lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.4). Critically, I must account for the 1,441 confirmed lost units (P3, P7, P12, P17) which still reside in the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1,846. This means the actual reliable pipeline is only 405 units (the order from P20). To ensure the OR backend places an order that bridges this gap, I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect recent volatility and an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory. Total Pipeline (1846) - Lost (1441) = 405 reliable. Target Inventory for L=3 should be (L+1)*Demand \u2248 4 * 430 = 1720. Setting mu_hat to 2600 (approx. 650/period) will signal the backend to order enough to cover the missing 1441 units while maintaining a summer-appropriate stock level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: P21 arrived in 1 period, while P18 took 3. Pipeline integrity remains severely compromised by 1,441 units across four lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17). Summer demand showing signs of stabilization or slight decline in July (Avg P20-P22: 257 vs P11-P19: 450).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) has shifted from the high summer peak (P11-P19 avg ~450) to a lower, stabilized July regime (P20-P23 avg ~246). This downward trend is consistent with the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is currently 519 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 2076 is misleading because 1441 units are confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P20 (405 units) and P23 (230 units), totaling 635 units. The actual lead time remains volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, so I will set L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the maximum expected arrival time. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current lower demand regime (~246/period), which prevents over-ordering and high holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: average demand decreased from ~450 to ~246 (-45%) as summer peak concludes. Reliable pipeline is 635 units; total confirmed lost units (P3, P7, P12, P17) remain 1441.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29, late July. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is exiting its peak summer demand phase. Analysis of the last five periods (P20-P24) shows a clear demand regime shift: the average demand has dropped to 238 units per period, compared to the summer peak (P11-P19) of ~440 units. This decline of ~46% is consistent with seasonal cooling for summer basics. Inventory reconciliation: Reported in-transit is 2,076 units, but 1,441 units (from orders P3, P7, P12, and P17) are confirmed lost based on excessive delays beyond the maximum observed lead time. The reliable pipeline is 635 units (P20: 405, P21: 969 arrived, P23: 230). Currently, on-hand inventory is 312. With reliable pipeline + on-hand totaling 947 units, and demand averaging ~240, we are well-covered for the next 3-4 periods. I am setting L to 3 to account for the frequent actual lead time of 3 periods, mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the lower late-summer demand, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~450 to ~238 (-47%) as the summer peak for jersey basics concludes. Reliable pipeline inventory remains significantly lower than reported due to 1,441 units confirmed lost (Orders P3, P7, P12, P17).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has entered a new lower regime as the summer peak concludes in early August. Analyzing demand since the shift in Period 20 (301, 232, 238, 212, 207, 154), the mean has stabilized around 224 units per period. The on-hand inventory of 388 units is sufficient to cover the next period's forecasted demand. Regarding the pipeline, total reported in-transit is 1846 units. However, consistent with the 'Carry-over Insights', orders from P3 (237), P7 (323), P12 (631), and P17 (250) are confirmed lost (total 1441 units). The reliable pipeline is actually 405 units (from P20). Total reliable inventory (on-hand 388 + reliable in-transit 405) = 793 units. With a target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + review=1) at ~224 units/period, the current reliable coverage is approximately 3.5 periods. To prevent overstocking during this declining demand phase while accounting for the high historical loss rate, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the 6-period post-peak regime (N=6). Lead time is set to the promised L=2 using the default method, as recent arrivals (P21, P23) have aligned closer to the 1-2 period range.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is clearly declining as the summer peak concludes, entering a post-summer regime. From Period 20 to Period 26, demand has dropped from a peak of ~450 to an average of ~206, with the most recent Period 26 hitting a low of 102 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1846 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17 totaling 1441 units), meaning the reliable pipeline is only 405 units (from P20). With 286 units on-hand and 405 reliable units in-transit, the effective inventory (691 units) is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime (avg ~200) across the lead time. Consequently, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift and avoid over-ordering during the seasonal decline. I will maintain L=3 via explicit to account for the frequent actual lead time delays observed, even though current stock levels are high.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed starting Period 20: average demand decreased from ~450 to ~206 (-54%). Significant pipeline inflation remains due to 1,441 confirmed lost units (P3, P7, P12, P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts has entered a post-summer cooling phase. Since Period 20, the average demand has dropped to approximately 206 units/period, compared to the summer peak of ~450. The last three periods (P25-P27) show an even lower average of 125 units, suggesting the decline is accelerating as we move further into August. The current on-hand inventory (166) plus the reliable pipeline (orders from P20, P21 onwards minus confirmed losses) is more than sufficient. Specifically, 1,441 units are confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17), leaving a massive gap between the reported 'In-transit' (1846) and what is actually arriving. However, even with only the P20 order (405 units) being potentially reliable, our coverage is high for the current low-demand regime. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the downward trend since P20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the default lead time as recent arrivals (P21 at L=1, P23 at L=2) are averaging close to the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline accelerating: Periods 25-27 average demand is 125 units, significantly lower than the P20-P24 average of 254 units. Reliable pipeline inventory is approximately 405 units (from P20) as 1,441 units (P3, P7, P12, P17) are confirmed lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues its post-summer decline. For the last 4 periods (P25-P28), average demand has dropped to approximately 134 units, compared to the previous regime of ~206. Current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), but reported in-transit is 1846 units. However, based on history, 1441 units (Orders P3, P7, P12, P17) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P20 (405 units) is now 8 periods overdue (L=8) and must be considered lost, bringing total lost units to 1846. This means the REAL pipeline is 0. To prevent a stockout in this low-demand phase while acknowledging the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (average of late arrivals), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4-period average (~134) to capture the cooling demand, and L=3 to account for historical delays.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: average demand for P25-P28 is ~134 units. Pipeline integrity is critical: 1846 units are now confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, and now P20 at L+8). Real pipeline inventory is currently zero.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 134.8 units, compared to the previous regime (P20-P24) of ~238 units. Inventory context: On-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1846 is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Specifically, the Period 20 order (405 units) is now 10 periods old with a promised lead time of 2, making it effectively lost. Consequently, the real pipeline inventory is 0. To reconcile this with the OR backend, which subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and L to bypass the backend's faulty pipeline logic. By setting mu_hat = (actual_forecast * (1+L)) + lost_units, I force the order logic to account for the phantom inventory. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~135 units/period = 405 units. To trigger an order of 405 units when the system thinks there are 1846 in transit, mu_hat must be set to approximately 2250 (405 + 1846). Sigma is set based on the recent variance to maintain a safety buffer against the volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline has reached a floor: Periods 25-29 average demand is ~135 units. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) now sum to 1846; real pipeline inventory is zero.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics) has stabilized in a post-summer regime. For the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged approximately 128 units per period (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145), showing consistent behavior after the summer peak. The In-transit figure of 2286 is highly misleading due to accumulated lost shipments from earlier periods (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20), totaling 1846 units. The actual reliable pipeline is only 440 units (the order from P30). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the actual pipeline at 440, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). A base stock for 3 periods at 128 units/period is 384 units. Since the actual pipeline (440) already exceeds this, the OR backend (if it knew the truth about lost orders) would not order. However, since the OR engine sees 2286 in-transit, it will definitely not order. My goal is to set parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime to prevent future over-ordering when the P30 shipment arrives. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer stability.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime floor confirmed: P25-P30 average demand is 127 units. Pipeline inflation is critical: 1846 units are confirmed lost across P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 32 (2019/09/16). The product is a jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which has transitioned from its summer peak into a stable post-summer demand floor. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has averaged 127 units with low volatility. Pipeline integrity is the primary challenge: 1,846 units are confirmed lost (Orders P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). The current 'In-transit' of 2,286 units includes these 1,846 lost units plus the Period 30 order of 440 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 440 units, which are expected to arrive in Period 32 or 33 (given L=2 or 3). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To maintain a service level appropriate for the current demand regime (~127/period) while accounting for the OR engine's tendency to overcount pipeline (it sees 2286 instead of 440), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on (1+L) periods of demand plus the volume of lost shipments to 'neutralize' the OR engine's incorrect pipeline count. Calculation: Target Base Stock for L=2 (3 periods) = 3 * 127 = 381. To ensure an order is placed despite the 2286 in-transit, mu_hat must be set high enough so that mu_hat - 2286 = Target Order. However, since the P30 order (440) is still valid, I will focus on stabilizing parameters using recent data for sigma and an explicit mu to manage the 'phantom' inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly' (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) has stabilized after its summer peak. In the most recent regime (Periods 25-32), the average demand is 132 units per period (154, 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135). The current on-hand inventory is 305 units. Lead time for the most recent arrival (P30) was the promised 2 periods, but history shows volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). The 'In-transit' figure of 1846 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20), meaning the actual pipeline is zero. I set L to 'default' (2) as the most recent shipment was on time. I use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the stabilized post-summer floor (avg ~132). This results in a base stock target of approx (1+2)*132 = 396 units. Given the on-hand of 305 and a zero functional pipeline, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the service level against the current holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor confirmed: average demand for P25-P32 is 132 units. Functional pipeline inventory remains zero; the reported 1846 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost across periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' has stabilized into a post-summer floor. Over the last 9 periods (P25-P33), the average demand is 133.5 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33) showing a mean of 141.6 units. The product is in a low-demand regime compared to its summer peak. Current on-hand inventory is 158 units. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 1846 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With a current on-hand of 158 and expected demand of ~140, the current stock will likely be exhausted by the end of Period 34. To maintain service levels for the upcoming 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3), I must signal the OR backend to place an order. Since the backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of 1846 'ghost' units in-transit will prevent it from ordering unless I use 'explicit' parameters to force a higher base stock or 'recent_N' to align with current demand while acknowledging the lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current stable floor (avg ~134) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for lead time (2 periods). However, because the backend subtracts the 1846 'In-transit' units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory and ensure an order is triggered to cover the next 3 periods of demand (~420 units total).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has stabilized at a lower floor following the summer peak. The average demand from Period 25 to Period 34 is approximately 131 units. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 106 units, continuing this trend. Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 2168 units is highly misleading. Based on historical data, shipments from Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20 (totaling 1846 units) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded any realistic lead time. Excluding these, the reliable pipeline consists only of the Period 34 order (322 units). With 52 units on-hand, the reliable inventory position is 374 units. At a demand rate of ~131/period, and an expected lead time of 2-3 periods, the inventory coverage is roughly 2.8 periods, which is sufficient for now given the holding cost. I will maintain L=default (2) but use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer stable regime and avoid over-ordering against a ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor remains stable: Period 25-34 average demand is 131 units. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline increased to 1846 (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20); these must be ignored when assessing stock levels. Real pipeline inventory consists only of the P34 order (322 units).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics) has entered a stable post-summer floor. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), average demand is 130 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P34-P35) show a slight dip to 85-106 units, suggesting a potential further decline as we move deeper into autumn (mid-October). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though recent orders (P30, P34) arrived in 2 and 1 periods respectively. Total 'In-transit' units (1846) consist of five confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) and should be ignored for pipeline calculations. The current on-hand inventory of 289 units, combined with the stable demand floor of ~130, provides approximately 2.2 periods of cover. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current inventory, I will set parameters to maintain a lean stock level while accounting for the recent demand stabilization around 130 units. Using N=11 for mu_hat effectively captures this stable regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics) has stabilized at a lower post-summer level. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), the average demand is approximately 116 units, down from the P25-P30 average of ~127 units. Currently, we have 205 units on-hand. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for (2+1)=3 periods. At the current rate of ~116 units/period, we require ~348 units to meet base stock targets. With 205 units on-hand and 0 units in the reliable pipeline (the 1846 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost across P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20), the OR backend will calculate an order to bridge this gap. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stabilized demand floor and ensure the OR engine does not over-order based on the much higher summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand floor has shifted lower: average demand for P31-P36 is ~116 units per period. Pipeline inflation remains at 1846 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20), meaning effective pipeline inventory is currently zero.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized at a lower 'post-summer' floor. Over the last seven periods (P31-P37), the average demand is approximately 116 units per period, showing a clear decline from the late-summer levels. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, and the reported 'In-transit' of 1846 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) and must be ignored for the OR backend's calculation. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order, and it sees 1846 units in transit, it will order 0 unless the parameters are adjusted. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming lead time (L=2) plus review period (1), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. I target a base stock covering ~3 periods of demand (3 * 116 = 348 units). Setting mu_hat to 348 and sigma_hat to 50 will signal the OR engine to place an order that overcomes the phantom pipeline, ensuring availability for November.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is November 4th, late autumn. Demand for this lightweight jersey t-shirt has continued to decline from its summer peak and settled into a lower, stable post-summer regime. For the last 4 periods (P35-P38), demand has averaged 89 units per period (85, 84, 109, 78), which is lower than the previous floor of ~116. On-hand inventory is 18 units, and there are no reliable units in-transit (the reported 1846 units are confirmed lost across P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20). Actual lead times recently have been 1-2 periods. To prevent a stockout in this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the most recent stabilized demand, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average of observed lead times, as the promised lead time of 2 remains a reasonable baseline despite historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime floor detected at Period 35: average demand for P35-P38 decreased to ~89 units per period (-23% vs P31-P34 average of ~116). Real pipeline inventory remains zero due to 1846 units confirmed lost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is late fall (2019/11/11). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing a clear seasonal decline. A new demand regime floor was detected at Period 35, with average demand dropping to ~89 units/period. The most recent demand (P39) was only 61 units, suggesting the floor may still be lowering. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward trend (P35-P39 mean is ~83). Regarding the 'In-transit' quantity of 1846 units: history confirms these are lost shipments from Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20. Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and these 1846 units will never arrive, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'over-order' and force the backend to bypass this phantom inventory. My target base stock is approximately (L+1) * 83 plus a safety buffer. With L=2, (3 * 83) = 249. To overcome the -1846 pipeline penalty, I set mu_hat explicitly high so that mu_hat - 1846 \u2248 250.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor confirmed at Period 35: average demand for P35-P39 is 83 units per period. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remain 1846; real pipeline inventory is zero.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019/11/18), the environment is in a late autumn/early winter 'trough' for the product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt). Demand has stabilized at a low floor: the average demand for the last six periods (P35-P40) is approximately 81 units, significantly lower than previous seasonal peaks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 2143 units is highly misleading; historical analysis confirms that 1846 units (from P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20) are lost. The only reliable order in the pipeline is from Period 40 (297 units). Given the lead time (L=2), this order should arrive during Period 42 or 43. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the low current demand while accounting for potential lead-time volatility (historically 1-3 periods). Setting L to 2 (default) and mu_hat using recent_N=6 captures the current low-demand regime (~81 units/period), resulting in a base stock requirement around 243 units. Since the reliable pipeline (297 units) already exceeds this, the OR engine will likely not place a new order this period, which is appropriate given the 0 units on-hand and the expected arrival next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains at the seasonal floor (P35-P40 average: 81 units/period). Reliable pipeline remains only the Period 40 order; total confirmed lost units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) still total 1846 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Demand has stabilized at a seasonal floor since Period 35, with the average demand for the last seven periods (P35-P41) being 79 units. The Period 40 order of 297 units arrived in Period 41 (lead time of 1 period), bringing on-hand inventory to 230 units. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 1846 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) and must be ignored. Effective pipeline inventory is currently zero. I will set mu_hat based on the recent floor (N=7) and use the recent average lead time behavior. Since on-hand (230) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead time + review period (~240 units), and the OR backend's base-stock calculation will account for this, the parameters are set to maintain this floor safety level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: We are at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently at its seasonal demand floor (average ~80-100 units/period). Historical demand for P35-P42 shows a stable regime around 82 units per period, with a slight uptick in P42 (109 units) potentially reflecting early holiday/Black Friday influence. Inventory status: On-hand is 121 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1846 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) and must be ignored for pipeline calculations. The OR backend will see 'In-transit: 1846' and attempt to subtract this from its base stock calculation; to prevent this, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. I choose an explicit mu_hat that reflects (L+1) * 100 units plus an offset to neutralize the 1846 phantom units. However, given the OR engine's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], the most effective way to manage this is to set mu_hat to cover the expected demand and acknowledge that no order will be placed until the phantom 1846 units are cleared or the stockout risk becomes massive. Since on-hand is 121 and demand is ~82, we have enough stock for the immediate period. For parameters: L is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the 1-2 period actual lead times. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current low-demand floor regime since Period 35.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (2019/12/09), approaching the end of the simulation at Period 47. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, and demand has settled into a low seasonal floor for winter. The average demand for the most recent regime (P35\u2013P43) is approximately 80 units per period, with a slight variation (range 61\u2013109). On-hand inventory is 60 units. The 'In-transit' count of 1846 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20) as established in the long-term carry-over insights; therefore, the functional pipeline is currently zero. To ensure coverage for the final 3 periods (P44, P45, P46) and account for the promised lead time of 2 periods, I will set mu_hat using the recent 9 periods to reflect the stable winter floor. No further shipments are expected unless ordered now. Given the low remaining periods, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will likely trigger a small replenishment order to cover the remaining demand while minimizing end-of-game holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized at its seasonal floor, with an average demand of approximately 74 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). The current on-hand inventory is 5 units. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 1846 units consists entirely of shipments from Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20, which are long-confirmed as lost and will never arrive. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since there are only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (45, 46, 47), and the lead time is typically 1-3 periods, we must place an order now to avoid a stockout in the final periods. Given the demand floor of ~75 units/period and a lead time of 2, a base stock targeting (L+1) periods (3 periods) should be around 225-250 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and 'default' for lead time will allow the OR engine to calculate parameters based on the current seasonal low while ignoring the massive historical summer peaks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 23 (Period 46), representing the deep winter seasonal floor for lightweight jersey t-shirts. Demand has remained consistently low and stable. Over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), the average demand is 71.2 units, slightly lower than the P35-P40 average of 81 units. Inventory is currently zero, and the reported 'In-transit' quantity of 1846 units consists entirely of shipments confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current stable demand floor (approx 71 units/period) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility in this regime. Lead time (L) is set to default (2) as recent deliveries (P34, P40) arrived in 1 period, suggesting no current delays beyond the promised 2 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 47, the final period of the simulation. The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand with a functional pipeline of 0 (the 1,846 units in-transit are confirmed lost from Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20). Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, any order placed now will not arrive within the simulation's timeframe. However, to maintain consistent logic for the OR backend, I will set parameters based on the current 'seasonal floor' demand regime. Since Period 35, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. For the last 12 periods (P35-P46), the average demand is approximately 78 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. I will use the recent_N method with N=12 to reflect this current regime, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock that aligns with these observations, even though no further arrivals will influence the final score.
