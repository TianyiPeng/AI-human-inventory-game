Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows an upward trend (148 to 308). The average demand of the provided history is 204.8. Given the product category and the date (mid-February), we are entering the Spring season, which likely explains the increasing demand trend for lightweight jersey basics. Promised lead time is 4. Since we have no observed history yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent (and higher) demand levels (avg ~205) rather than the all-time mean, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 205 = 1025.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266]. The last three periods (233, 308, 266) average ~269, compared to the earlier average of ~161. This represents a significant demand regime shift likely due to seasonality or product lifecycle. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order of 314 units (placed in P1) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in P5). We need to maintain a pipeline that covers the (L+1) = 5 period horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher demand level while using 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility across all periods. Lead time stays at the 'default' promised 4 periods as we have no evidence of drift yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend (148, 175, 160, 233, 308) followed by high demand in Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316). We started with 0 inventory and are currently stock-out because orders from Period 1 and 2 (totaling 689) have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in Period 6. Since demand is showing a significant level shift from the initial pre-game samples (avg ~185) to recent periods (avg ~291 for last 2), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime. L is set to 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current history shows strong and growing demand (266, 316, 306) which exceeds the initial historical samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. We are currently at Period 4, and since the promised lead time (L) is 4, no orders placed in Periods 1-3 have arrived yet. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are losing sales. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~296 per week). For L, I will use 'default' (promised L=4) as we have not yet reached the horizon to observe arrivals (first arrival expected at Period 5 conclude/Period 6 start). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to better reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Period 1: demand (avg ~296) is significantly higher than the early historical samples (avg ~180).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a new, higher regime (avg ~294 over the last 4 periods) compared to the initial historical seed (avg ~205). Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the lifecycle, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and should be visible in the Period 6 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have concluded yet. Total in-transit is 1370, which covers the current backlog and forecasted demand for the next few periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime (Periods 1-4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the default L=4 until we observe the first arrival to confirm actual lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Historic demand (initial 5 samples) was around 200, but recent demand (Periods 1-5) has averaged 284.6. A regime shift was noted in Period 4. Regarding lead time: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4) holds. On-hand inventory is 62 units, with 1,193 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2-5). The pipeline is quite full. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to forecast for a (L+1) = 5 period window. Given the steady demand pattern of around 285 units per week since the start of the game, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime without being influenced by the significantly lower initial historical samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to pre-game data, with the last 6 periods averaging 282 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 1 and 2 confirm the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand (167) + In-transit (1037) = 1204 units. Expected demand over the next 5 periods based on the recent average of 282 is roughly 1410. Current pipeline is slightly short for the upcoming period. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current stable demand regime and use the default lead time (4) which has been validated.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime than the initial pre-game history. The average demand over the 7 periods of play is approximately 294, while the last 3 periods averaged 329, showing a slight recent upward trend. All orders have arrived exactly on their promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7). Currently, we have 144 units on hand and 950 in-transit. The OR backend will compute the order based on a base stock level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher demand regime observed since Period 1, ignoring the much lower pre-game history. Lead time L will remain default as it aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Women's T-shirt) is showing a consistent upward trend in demand as we enter April, which aligns with seasonal transition into spring. Historical demand in the first 4 periods averaged ~293, while the most recent 4 periods (P5-P8) averaged ~315, with P7 and P8 specifically spiking to 364 and 372. This suggests a demand regime shift upwards compared to the initial historical data. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been perfectly consistent for the last 4 arrivals (P5-P8). Inventory is currently tight with 112 on hand, but there are 967 units in transit. Given the recent spike, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility while maintaining the default lead time setting as it matches reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has increased from an average of ~293 (P1-P4) to ~315 (P5-P8), with the most recent two weeks exceeding 360 units, indicating spring seasonality peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/4/15), which is mid-spring. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, seeing a seasonal demand increase. Demand mean has shifted from ~293 (P1-P4) to ~315 (P5-P9). Despite the lower demand in P9 (271), the previous two weeks were 360+, and on-hand inventory hit zero in P9 due to a smaller-than-typical arrival from the P5 order (137 units). The pipeline (in-transit) is currently 1247 units (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since P6-P9 orders were sized based on higher demand, they should begin arriving soon (P6 order due P10). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current spring demand regime and volatility (~315 units/period), and calculate for L to leverage historical stability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's T-shirt in lightweight jersey, currently in the peak spring season (late April). Historical demand data suggests a significant regime shift: early samples (past demands) averaged ~205, whereas recent data (P1-P10) averages ~301. The last four periods (P7-P10) show a higher average of ~329 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the last two periods (P9, P10) resulted in stockouts (sold < demand). There is a large in-transit pipeline (1418 units) consisting of orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10. All observed lead times (P5-P10) have been exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand spring regime (approx. 329 units/period) and ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the (L+1) window, helping to recover from the current stockout state as soon as the P7 order arrives this period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its peak seasonal demand period as confirmed by the spike in Period 11 (demand = 564). Historical demand has transitioned from ~293 (P1-P4) to ~315 (P5-P8) and now significantly higher (~381 avg P9-P11). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from P1 through P7. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last three periods (P9-P11) due to demand exceeding recent arrivals. To capture the current high-demand regime and prevent further lost sales during this peak spring/summer transition, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P9, P10, P11) which average 381.67 per period. For a lead time L=4, mu_hat = (1+L) * 381.67 = 1908.35. Sigma_hat is also updated using the last 3 samples to reflect the increased volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Significant demand spike to 564 units (nearly double the previous baseline) confirming peak season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt experiencing a significant seasonal demand peak in early May (Period 12 demand was 424, Period 11 was 564). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 1769 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand for the last 3 periods (P10-P12) shows a regime shift with a mean of 432.67 units, which is much higher than the previous period's average. Given we are in the middle of a confirmed spring peak, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and volatility. In Period 13, an order of 417 units (from P9) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase, which should help mitigate the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed peak season for Womens Everyday Basics: demand for P11-P12 averaged 494 units, significantly higher than the previous spring baseline of 315 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13), which is the peak season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. Historical lead times have been consistently 4 periods. While demand dropped to 304 last period from the high of 564/424, this likely reflects volatility within the peak season rather than a full regime end, as spring/summer demand typically remains elevated. Looking at the last three periods (P11-P13), the average demand is 430.6. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this higher seasonal average while acknowledging the recent drop. On-hand is low (113), but in-transit (1,986) is very high due to the recent large orders (P12: 644, P13: 634), which are expected to arrive in P16 and P17. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time is exactly as promised (4), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in the last 3 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown a significant seasonal shift. The initial demand (P1-P4) was ~292; the spring baseline (P5-P10) was ~315; and the recent peak (P11-P14) has averaged 430.75 units. The spikes of 564 and 431 suggest we are in the heart of the spring/early summer season. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Since we have been experiencing stockouts recently (P9-P12), and the demand signal remains high (431 in P14), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this elevated demand regime (avg ~431). This ensures mu_hat is based on the most relevant seasonal data for the upcoming 5-period window (Review + Lead Time). Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16 (late May). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is experiencing high seasonal demand. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has surged significantly, averaging 433 units/period (564, 424, 304, 431, 442), compared to the earlier spring average of ~315. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit (pipeline) is high at 1964 units. Given the sustained high demand regime starting around Period 11, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak summer seasonality. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the elevated demand during the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed (P11-P15): Mean demand has stabilized at ~433 units/period, up from the P5-P8 average of ~315 (+37%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17 (early June), managing 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. Historically, demand shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 11 (late April) and has stabilized at a summer peak (mean demand P11-P16 is ~433 units). The most recent period (P16) demand was 435 units, supporting this stabilization. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). On-hand inventory is 209, with 1695 in transit. The OR backend needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent demand regime (N=6, from P11 to P16) provides the most accurate forecast for mu_hat ensuring we maintain the summer service level while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen during the jump to this regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is currently in its summer peak. Period 17 saw a significant demand jump to 640 units, following a stabilized regime of ~433 units (P11-P15). This suggests a potential second-order spike as June proceeds. The actual lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P13 order arriving in P17). Inventory management is currently lean; although 634 units arrived in P17, they were nearly all consumed by the high demand (ending OH: 203). To maintain service levels during this June peak, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent high demand (P14-P17 avg: 487) and using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the 640-unit spike. L remains 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime intensified in June: Period 17 demand spike (640 units) represents a 47% increase over the previous summer baseline of 433 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a sustained summer high regime. The current date is mid-June, and the last 8 periods (P11-P18) show a mean demand of 446 units, which is significantly higher than the initial spring levels. The most recent demand (P17: 640, P18: 419) suggests continued volatility around this higher mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P5-P18 concludes). To avoid the frequent stockouts observed in Periods 9-12 and 15, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (the summer regime) to capture the 446/period average. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods is verified in history. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same 8-period window to capture the increased volatility associated with the summer peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late June (2019/06/24), which is the heat of the summer peak for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P15-P19), the mean demand is approximately 475 units (442, 435, 640, 419, 439), with a significant spike of 640 in P17. The carry-over insight from Period 18 suggests an intensified regime. Given the inventory position (on-hand is low at 31, but in-transit is very high at 2009 units), the priority is ensuring the OR backend correctly estimates future demand to maintain the high service level required for a 4:1 profit/holding cost ratio. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P16-P19). I will use the recent_N method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this summer regime, using N=5 to reflect the current June-July levels.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (June) confirmed: Mean demand for P15-P19 is ~475 units/period, with volatility remaining high due to seasonal spikes.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019, following a high-demand June. Demand in Period 20 dropped to 301, suggesting we may be moving past the peak summer retail surge for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand remains high at approximately 447 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the P16 order arriving in P20). Our pipeline (in-transit) is 2144 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of average demand at current rates. Given the slight softening in demand in P20, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent summer baseline (approx 447 units/period) while allowing for the possibility of seasonality tapering off as we enter July. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has seen strong demand throughout the spring and into summer. Current demand has cooled slightly from the June peak (avg ~475) to an average of 266 over the last two periods (P20-P21). However, the July 8th date suggests we are still in the summer season, and demand may remain around 300-400 units. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. With 291 on-hand and 1,941 in-transit, our pipeline is very full (including large orders from periods 18, 19, and 20). I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the transition from the mid-summer peak while ensuring we don't over-order as demand begins to normalize. The backend z* calculation (Profit $4 / (4+1) = 0.8) provides a healthy service level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has seen a significant seasonal curve. Demand peaked in June (Period 17 at 640 units) and has since decelerated sharply as we move into mid-July (Period 21: 232, Period 22: 238). This suggests the summer peak has passed and we are entering a lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (724 units) following the arrival of a large shipment from P18. Combined with 1363 units in-transit, our total coverage is very high relative to the cooling demand. To avoid excessive holding costs on a declining trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand drop (average ~257). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the reduction in volatility as the seasonal spikes subside. L will be left at calculate as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Demand has dropped from a June average of ~475 to a July (P21-P22) average of ~235 (-50%), signaling the end of the summer peak for this T-shirt SKU.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (Date: 2019/7/22, Period 24). Historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the peak summer demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt (Jersey Basic) has ended. Demand has dropped from a June average of ~475 to a July average (P21-P23) of 227 units. With current on-hand inventory at 1057 units and 818 units in-transit (total 1875), and recent demand averaging ~227, we have approximately 8 periods of supply already available or arriving soon. This significantly exceeds the total coverage needed for the promised 4-period lead time plus current review period (L+1=5). Consequently, the base stock calculation will likely yield an order of zero, which is appropriate given the surplus of inventory during this post-peak regime. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has remained stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak (June/July). The average demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) is approximately 222 units, a significant drop from the ~475 units seen in June. My current on-hand inventory is 1,360 units, and there are 308 units still in transit (ordered in P21 and P22). With an expected demand of around 220 units per period, the total inventory position (1,668 units) covers over 7 periods of demand, which is far beyond the (L+1=5) period target. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Therefore, I will continue to place zero orders by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime (last 4 periods) while keeping L at the promised 4 periods. This allows the system to bleed off the excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a clear post-summer decline. Since early July (Period 21), demand has dropped from an average of ~475 units to a recent average of ~208 units (P21-P25), with the most recent observation at 154 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high (1421 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the June peak. This inventory already covers approximately 7-9 periods of current demand, which is well beyond the (L+1=5) target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (the post-peak regime) to accurately reflect the lower demand level and prevent the OR backend from triggering unnecessary orders while we burn through the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime settled (P21-P25): Average demand has stabilized at ~208 units, down from the June peak of ~475 (-56%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has clearly entered a post-summer decline. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 183 units, with the most recent week dropping to 102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1412 units with no further units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need enough inventory to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). Even at the previous stabilized average of ~200 units, the 1412 units on hand cover roughly 7 periods of demand. To minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit) while maintaining a high service level, no new orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the declining trend in mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period promise has been consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed (P22-P26): demand has dropped to an average of ~183 units, with the most recent observation reaching a low of 102 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has clearly exited its summer peak. In Period 27, the demand was 120 units, and the average over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is approximately 159 units. The on-hand inventory is currently very high at 1292 units, which is significantly more than what is needed to cover the promised lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (L+1=5) at the current post-summer demand rate (159 * 5 = 795). No new orders are needed (in-transit is 0, but on-hand is already sufficient). Given the decline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders while we burn through existing stock to minimize holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has clearly moved past its summer peak (which was ~475 units in June) and settled into a lower post-summer regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has averaged approximately 147 units (158, 120, 102, 154, 207). We are currently in late August (Period 29), and the inventory on hand is 1134 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the current demand average is ~147, our total inventory covers nearly 8 weeks of supply (1134 / 147 \u2248 7.7). No new orders have been placed since Period 22 to allow the excess stock built up during the seasonal transition to deplete. We will continue this strategy to minimize holding costs while the inventory levels normalize toward a base stock level appropriate for the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has stabilized in a post-summer low-demand regime. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is ~135 units, significantly down from the summer peak averages (>400 units). On-hand inventory is currently 994 units, with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) covers over 7 periods of current demand (994 / 135 \u2248 7.3). Since the target base stock aims to cover only review+lead (5 periods), we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P24-P29) to capture this lower baseline which averages ~147. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed (P25-P29): Demand has settled into a low-volume regime averaging ~135 units per period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has entered a stable post-summer low-volume regime. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), the mean demand is approximately 133 units (102, 120, 158, 140, 145), which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 30 stating an average of ~135 units. The current on-hand inventory is 849 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At a forecast of ~135 units per period, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 675 units. Our current inventory (849) already exceeds this requirement. Therefore, the OR backend will correctly result in 0 new orders as long as we define the parameters based on the current regime. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the stabilization since Period 25 and allow the OR engine to manage the safety stock for this lower-demand phase while winding down the excess inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has settled into a stable, low-volume post-summer regime. Over the last seven periods (P25-P31), demand has consistently averaged 141.4 units (ranging from 102 to 158), which is a significant drop from the summer peak (~475 units). Current on-hand inventory is 708 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (708 / 141 \u2248 5.02). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, and we want to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, we are currently at the desired base-stock level. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we have zero in-transit inventory, we should maintain a conservative ordering stance to continue drawing down the remaining excess inventory from the summer peak. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is in a stable post-summer demand regime. For the last 8 periods (P25-P32), demand has averaged approximately 142 units per period, with a very tight range (102 to 158 units). Current on-hand inventory is 573 units, with 15 units in transit (ordered in P32), totaling 588 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~142, the total requirement is approximately 710 units. Our current inventory (588) is slightly below this requirement, but given the holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the backend OR policy will determine if additional ordering is necessary based on the service level. To reflect the current stable regime, I will use recent_N with N=8 for both demand and sigma, and default for lead time as arrivals have consistently followed the 4-period promise.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized in a low-volume post-summer regime. Since Period 25, demand has consistently averaged approximately 140 units per period (P25-P33 mean = 138). On-hand inventory is 426 units and in-transit is 146 (ordered P32 and P33). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a 4-period lead time, the inventory position needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) = 572 units. At an average demand of 140, 5 periods of demand equals 700 units. Therefore, a restock is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the stabilized demand regime since Period 25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains 'default' (4 weeks).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has clearly settled into a stable, low-volume regime following the summer peak. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 135 units/period, and the last 5 periods (P30-P34) average 134.8 units. The current date is Oct 7th, which in fashion retail typically precedes the next seasonal shift, but for this specific basic item, demand is currently flat and predictable. My strategy is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current period (Review=1), totaling 5 periods of demand. With On-hand = 320 and In-transit = 297 (total inventory = 617), we are well-covered for the next 4.5 periods at the current demand rate (~135). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this stable post-summer baseline and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current lower volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a stable post-summer demand regime. Since Period 25, demand has averaged approximately 127 units per period (P25-P35), with the most recent four periods (P32-P35) averaging ~118 units. On-hand inventory is 235 units, and there are 391 units in transit (ordered in P32-P35). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 626 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~125 units/period). Given the declining trend (most recent demand was 85 units) and the transition into mid-October, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current stable-to-slightly-decreasing demand mean (approx 125 units) and variance, ensuring we don't over-order as we move further from the peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has transitioned into a late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Analyzing demand since the post-summer stabilization (Period 25 to present), there's a clear secondary downward trend: Period 25-31 averaged ~134 units, while Period 32-36 has averaged ~111 units. The most recent three periods (P34-P36) have dropped further to an average of ~92 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived in P36). I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-volume demand using a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the trend while maintaining enough safety stock for potential demand floor stabilization. Sigma_hat will also be adjusted based on the last 5 periods to mirror the reduced volatility of the current regime, ensuring we minimize holding costs as we near the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Average demand has decreased from ~135 units (P25-P33) to ~92 units (P34-P36), a ~32% reduction as the SKU enters late autumn.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October (2019/10/28), and demand has reached a stable late-autumn low. A regime shift was identified at Period 34, with average demand dropping to ~92 units per period from the previous ~135. Specifically, demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) has been 106, 85, 84, and 109, confirming this lower volume environment. On-hand inventory is 188 units, and the pipeline contains 315 units (ordered P34-P37). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the current inventory level of ~500 units (on-hand + pipeline) against a weekly demand of ~96, we are well-covered for the next 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current late-autumn demand mean and variance while keeping the lead time at 'default' (4 periods).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt (610776002) is currently in a late-autumn demand regime. As noted in the Period 37 carry-over insight, demand shifted downward around Period 34. The last 5 periods (P34-P38) show demand values of [106, 85, 84, 109, 78], averaging 92.4 units per period. This confirms the lower baseline compared to the previous ~135 units avg (P25-P33). Lead time has been consistently stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36, P33 order arrived P37, P34 order arrived P38). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 261 on-hand and 167 in-transit. Given the seasonal nature of a lightweight jersey T-shirt, I expect demand to remain at this lower level or slightly decrease further as winter approaches. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-autumn demand regime (approx 92/period), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects the current mean and volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is in a late autumn decline. Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has shifted from a stabilized ~135 units (P25-P33) to a significantly lower regime. The last 6 periods (P34-P39) show demands of 106, 85, 84, 109, 78, and 61, averaging ~87.1 units per period. The most recent demand (61) confirms a continuing downward trend as we approach winter. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. With 294 units on hand and 134 in transit (from P36-P39), we have 428 units available to cover the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). At the current mean of ~87, we need roughly 435 units to maintain service levels. The current inventory is nearly sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-season low-demand regime, ensuring we do not overstock heading into the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Average demand has stabilized at ~87 units (P34-P39), a ~35% decrease from the previous autumn average (~135), reflecting late-season cooling for this T-shirt SKU.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt SKU. Demand has been on a sustained downward trend as established in Carry-over insights for Periods 37 and 40. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 84.6 units (106, 85, 84, 109, 78, 61, 69), significantly lower than the previous autumn average (~135). The most recent three periods (P38-P40) average 69.3 units, signaling a potential further cooling as winter approaches. Lead times have been consistently stable at exactly 4 periods. Inventory levels (On-hand: 280, In-transit: 121) are currently high relative to this lower demand regime, providing over 4 periods of coverage at current rates. I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized late-season demand while ignoring the higher-volume summer/early autumn data. L is set to default as promised lead time is consistently met.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, currently in late November (Period 42). Demand has stabilized in a late-autumn/winter low-volume regime. Since Period 34, demand has consistently averaged around 85 units per period. The most recent demand (P41) was 67 units, following a sequence of 106, 85, 84, 109, 78, 61, 69, 67. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 228 units, and in-transit is 162 units (total pipeline = 390). Given the current demand mean (~85), the base stock (L+1=5 periods) should be around 425 units plus a safety buffer. With 390 units already in the system and demand showing a slight downward trend or stabilization at low levels, I will use a recent_N (N=8) approach to capture the current late-season demand regime (starting P34) while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt reached its late autumn/winter bottom around Period 34. Recent demand (P34-P42) averages 85.3 units per period. The most recent demand (P42) was 109 units, slightly above the recent mean but likely short-term volatility rather than a new regime shift. As we are now in early December (P43), demand for a lightweight jersey T-shirt is expected to remain at its seasonal low or potentially see a small holiday-related bump, though the primary seasonal peaks are spring and summer. Inventory is currently high (on-hand 122 + in-transit 214 = 336 units), which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=9, corresponding to the late-autumn regime starting P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the lower-volume winter period while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the end-of-year period.

Since Period 34, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~81 units) compared to the summer peak. The most recent demand (Period 43) was 61 units, consistently within this lower band. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P44-P47), and given the current on-hand inventory (122) plus in-transit units (270), the total pipeline of 392 comfortably covers the expected demand for the remainder of the horizon (~81 units/period * 4 periods = 324 units). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime since late September, which helps prevent over-ordering as the simulation approaches its end.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Mean demand from Period 34 to 43 has averaged ~81 units/period, confirming a sustained winter baseline for this lightweight jersey T-shirt.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, and we are in a stable winter demand regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historical data from Period 34 to 44 shows a mean demand of approximately 81 units per period with relatively low volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual observations (Period 40 order arrived in Period 44). Current on-hand inventory is 109 units, and in-transit inventory is 287 units, totaling 396 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean of ~81, the required pipeline is roughly 405 units. Since our current total position (396) is just under this, and the OR engine will apply standard safety stock logic, setting the demand parameters to reflect the recent stable 11-period winter regime (N=11) is appropriate. This ensures we don't over-order during this low-demand season while maintaining sufficient service levels.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a stable winter demand regime. Period 46 (Dec 23) occurs just before Christmas; historical data for this 'Everyday Basic' shows demand is relatively resilient but has stabilized at a low winter baseline. Over the last 12 periods (P34-P45), the mean demand is ~79 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P41-P45) show a mean of ~71 units, though Period 42 showed a small spike (109). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0 (a critical ratio favoring a service level ~0.8), we must avoid overstocking during this low-season phase. On-hand is 101 units, and In-transit is 275 units (orders from P42-P45). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=12) to capture the winter baseline while ignoring the higher autumn/summer volumes. Sigma_hat will use N=12 to properly account for the occasional spikes seen in this regime (like P42), ensuring the base stock level remains robust against minor volatility without over-ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand for this item peaked in summer (Period 17: 640 units) and has steadily declined through autumn and winter. We are currently in Period 47 (Dec 30), which is mid-winter. The demand regime from Period 34 to 46 has stabilized at a low winter baseline, with a mean of approximately 80 units/period (P34-P46 mean = 80.07). The most recent demand was 92 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P42 order arrived in P46). Inventory levels are currently balancing: on-hand is 64, and there is a healthy pipeline of 277 units. Given the low-demand winter period and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0 (critical ratio 0.8), we want to avoid overstocking while maintaining a decent service level. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat to capture the entire winter baseline (from Period 34 onwards) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.
