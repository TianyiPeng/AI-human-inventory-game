Recent samples show an upward trend. Given it's February 11th, we are entering the spring season, which likely explains the higher recent figures in the samples. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed now (P1) should arrive at the start of P4 (N+L+1 visibility). d) Inventory: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I need to cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 until the first order arrives. e) Order Logic: Based on an average of ~205 and the recent upward momentum, I will target a coverage of roughly 3 periods of demand plus safety stock for the lead time period. Targeting ~650 units total to ensure I don't stock out during the initial periods while waiting for the first delivery. Since on-hand is 0, the order should be the full target amount.",

Based on recent lead times of 2-3 periods, P11 (350 units) is expected to arrive during Period 14, and P12 (400 units) during Period 14 or 15. Since lead time is ~2 periods and we are currently out of stock, I need to cover Period 14, 15, and 16 demand (L+1). Estimated demand is ~420 per period. Total needed = 1260.

Current demand is low, averaging ~65 units per period over the last three weeks. There are 6 periods remaining (P42 to P47), with an estimated total remaining demand of approximately 360-400 units. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 3050 units. This pipeline consists of several overdue orders (P17: 600, P19: 650, P20: 550, P18: 700? No, P18 arrived. P17/P19/P20/etc.). Specifically, the 3050 units in-transit are far more than enough to cover the rest of the game's demand. If any of these shipments arrive, they will immediately satisfy all remaining demand and likely result in significant holding costs. Given that 3050 units are already in the pipeline and only ~400 units are needed to finish the game, any further ordering is mathematically unjustifiable and would only increase the risk of massive holding cost penalties without increasing sales potential.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Late November demand regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' is stable at ~60-70 units. Remaining lifetime demand (P42-P47) is estimated at <400 units. The 3050-unit pipeline is 7.5x the total remaining demand.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but the in-transit pipeline is massive at 3,050 units, consisting of several overdue high-volume orders (including P17, P19, and P20). A single one of these shipments arriving would provide enough stock to cover all remaining demand for the rest of the game. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), any additional order would only increase the risk of massive holding costs if the legacy pipeline finally clears. Even though we are currently out of stock, the 3,050 units already in the pipeline represent more than 7x the total possible remaining sales. Therefore, ordering more units is economically irrational as the pipeline is already over-saturated.",

The remaining lifetime demand for the product (P44-P47) is estimated at roughly 250-300 units total. There is a massive in-transit pipeline of 3,050 units (Orders P7, P17, P19, P20), which is more than 10x the remaining demand. While these orders have been significantly delayed and are potentially lost, the arrival of even a single shipment would result in a massive overstock and high holding costs ($1/unit) for the final periods. Given that profit is $4/unit and the game ends in 4 periods, ordering more stock now is mathematically unsound. The risk of incurring holding costs on thousands of units far outweighs the potential profit from the low remaining demand. I will continue to hold the order at 0.",

This pipeline consists of several late/overdue orders (including P17, P19, P20) that have not arrived for over 20 periods. Given that any single shipment arriving from this 3050-unit pipeline would completely saturate the remaining demand and lead to significant holding cost penalties (Holding Cost = $1.0 vs Profit = $4.0), and the proximity to the game's end, the optimal strategy is to place zero new orders.
