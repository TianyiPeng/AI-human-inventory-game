The historical demand [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] shows a clear upward trend, with the most recent demand being more than double the earliest sample. The OR recommendation of 314 units is based on the promised lead time of 4 periods and the average demand of approximately 205 units. However, the current date (February) precedes the typical spring/summer demand ramp-up for jersey basics. Given the starting on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is empty, we must establish a base stock immediately. The 'In-transit' items will take 4 periods to arrive (arriving during Period 5 and visible in Period 6).

Period 1 demand was 266, which is significantly higher than the early historical average but aligns with the recent upward trend (last three: 233, 308, 266).

If we estimate demand at ~250 units/period, target inventory is 1,250. 314 (in-transit) + 321 (OR rec) = 635 total, which is still quite conservative relative to the target level needed to bridge the 4-period lead time. \n\n4. **Final Strategy**: Since we started with 0 inventory and have a 4-period lead time, we will experience stockouts until Period 5.

The OR recommendation is 345, which factors in a predicted mean demand of ~220 units. However, recent demand is averaging ~290. Given the consistent stockouts and increasing demand for basics in late February/early March, I will follow the OR recommendation as a floor but ensure the pipeline is robust. Since we are currently at 0 inventory and the pipeline (635) only covers roughly 2 periods of recent demand while lead time is 4, we are under-stocked for the lead-time window.

The product is a 'Women's Everyday Basic' T-shirt, and we are entering March, where demand for lightweight jersey tops typically climbs or stabilizes. 3. **Inventory & OR Recommendation**: Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 980 units (314 from P1, 321 from P2, 345 from P3).

However, the OR's base stock (approx 1347 if using high demand) is nearly met by the existing pipeline. 5. Strategy: I need to cover Period 5 demand (which happens after this decision) and ensure the pipeline covers future periods. Given avg demand is ~293, the current pipeline covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand. Since L=4, the pipeline is almost exactly target.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has significantly increased. The average demand over the last 8 periods is ~296, much higher than the initial historical average of 204. The last two periods (P7-P8) saw demand spike to 364 and 372. This is consistent with seasonal timing for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (T-shirts) as spring (April) begins. 4.

Inventory Position: On-hand is 139. In-transit consists of orders from P6 (300), P8 (328), and P9 (384). Note: Period 7 had an order of 0, which means no arrival is expected in Period 11. This creates a gap in the supply pipeline. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 309 is based on the capped policy using a blend of old and new data.

Demand Analysis: Demand has increased significantly. While historical samples (Avg 204) and early periods (Avg ~296) were lower, Period 11 saw a massive spike to 564 units (Spring timing for a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey'). This follows a general upward trend for basic apparel as the season warms up. I expect demand to remain in the 300-500 range.\n\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P8 (328), P9 (384), P10 (360), and P11 (300) totaling 1372 units. The P8 order (328 units) is scheduled to arrive in Period 12.\n\n4. OR Comparison: The OR baseline recommends 251 units using historical averages (204). However, the actual demand average since P1 is 328, and the most recent demand was 564. The OR algorithm is under-forecasting because it doesn't account for the seasonal shift in basic jersey apparel. \n\n5. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 12-16 (L+1).

Lost Orders: The order from Period 7 (0 units) was an intentional non-order, but the Period 11 arrival (from P7) was actually $0$, so the pipeline is intact. 4.

The current mean for the seasonal period (P11-P13) is 430. 5.

Current on-hand inventory is very high at 1154 units. \n\nLead-time Inference: Actual lead time consistently aligns with the promised 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25; P20 arrived P24). There are currently no units in transit as orders were paused from P22-P26 to burn off excess stock. \n\nStrategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 511 units is rejected. The OR algorithm appears to be reacting to the historical average (which includes the significant summer peaks) or attempting to hit a base-stock level that overestimates current needs. With on-hand inventory (1154) covering more than 6-10 periods of current demand (avg ~100-180), and a holding cost of $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit, maintaining such high inventory is inefficient.

Recent demands for P39-P41 were 61, 69, and 67 units respectively. The current average demand is approximately 81 units/period, which is roughly 60% lower than the original baseline (204) used by the OR algorithm.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 121 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 220 units (80 from P38, 50 from P39, 90 from P41). Total Inventory Position (IP) = 121 + 220 = 341 units.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 473 units is based on the full history (which includes massive summer peaks of ~485 units) and is clearly over-forecasting for the current winter trough. To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the current rate of ~81 units, we need a Target Stock Level (TSL) of approximately 405 units. With an current IP of 341, we only need to order 64 units to reach this target. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 42 of 47) and demand is low, I will order 70 units to ensure safety without incurring excessive holding costs.",

The OR baseline recommendation of 470 units is severely overestimating demand because it incorporates those historical peaks without recency weighting. My inventory position is currently: On-hand (92) + In-transit (210) = 302 units. The pipeline consists of orders from P39 (50), P41 (90), and P42 (70). Given a promised lead time of 4 periods and a current demand rate of ~83, 302 units covers approximately 3.6 periods of demand, which is nearly the full lead-time requirement. Ordering 470 units as suggested by the OR would lead to massive overstocking and high holding costs ($1/unit) for a product currently in its off-season. I will ignore the OR recommendation and place a small order of 50 units to maintain a lean pipeline as we approach the end of the year, ensuring we don't stock out if there's a minor pre-holiday bump, while primarily focusing on minimizing holding costs.",

Current demand is averaging approximately 75-80 units per period (P39-P43 average is 73.4). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My objective is to manage the inventory through the final periods of the game (ending at Period 47). As of Period 44, on-hand inventory is 81 units and in-transit is 210 units (ordered in P41, P42, P43). The expected arrivals are: Period 45 (90 units from P41), Period 46 (70 units from P42), and Period 47 (50 units from P43). Combined with the current 81 on-hand, the total inventory available to satisfy demand for the remaining 4 periods (P44-47) is 291 units. With a demand forecast of roughly 80 units/period, the total expected demand for the remaining game is ~320 units. The OR recommendation of 468 is extremely high because it is still factoring in the high historical mean from the summer peaks and using a safety stock calculation for an infinite horizon. Ordering 468 units now would result in massive holding costs and excess stock at the end of the game (Period 47 concludes the sequence).

The OR recommendation of 466 units is based on an inflated base-stock level that likely weighs historical/Summer demand too heavily and ignores the current seasonality. With on-hand inventory at 26 and in-transit units totaling 240 (scheduled arrivals from P41, P42, P43, P44), our pipeline is well-positioned for the current demand regime. Specifically: Current inventory (26) + Pending arrivals (90 + 70 + 50 + 30 = 240) = 266 units. At an expected demand of ~75 units/period, this covers ~3.5 periods. Since the game ends at Period 47, we only need to cover demand for Period 45, 46, and 47. Total remaining demand is roughly 75 * 3 = 225 units. We already have 266 units in the system.

Recent demand for Period 46 was 92 units, with the Period 40-44 average around 72 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Following the OR recommendation would result in excessive holding costs during this low-demand period. Current inventory + pipeline (30 + 240 = 270) is sufficient to cover approximately 3.3 periods of demand at the current rate (~80 units).
