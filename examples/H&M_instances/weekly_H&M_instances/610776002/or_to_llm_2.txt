{
  "rationale": "Step 1: Lead-Time Inference. The promised lead time is 2 periods. As this is Period 1, no historical arrival data exists yet to verify if the actual lead time differs. I will proceed using the assumption of L=2 for now. Step 2: Inventory & Demand Analysis. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand samples are [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], showing a clear upward trend. The SKU 'Tilly' (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is a staple item, but the recent demand spike suggests a regime shift or seasonal build-up as we move into February. Step 3: OR Recommendation Evaluation. The OR recommendation is 314 units. This is based on a critical fractile (q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8) and historical mean. However, the OR agent uses all samples equally, whereas the last two samples (233, 308) are significantly higher than the first three (avg ~161). Step 4: Final Strategy. To prevent stockouts given the increasing demand trend and the 2-period lead time (meaning this order covers demand for Period 3), I will slightly increase the order quantity above the OR baseline to account for the recent upward momentum which the OR's simple mean-based approach lags behind.",

The order placed in Period 1 (340 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 4's decision phase. Currently, it is correctly listed in 'In-transit'. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 1 was 266 units, which resulted in 266 lost sales because the starting inventory was 0. This demand is significantly higher than the pre-game average of ~205 (148-308 range), suggesting the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt is in a high-demand phase, likely due to spring seasonality in February. 3. Strategy: The goal is to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. With demand currently around 266, we need approximately 798 units in the pipeline. We have 340 in transit. The OR recommendation of 321 units is based on historical averages including the lower pre-game samples.

Total in-transit is 660 units (360 ordered in P2, 300 ordered in P3). Since actual lead time is 1, the 360 units ordered in P2 will arrive during P4 and become available for sale, but are not yet reflected in on-hand. The 300 units from P3 will arrive in P5.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand and recent observations (266, 316, 306) show a clear upward shift compared to the initial samples (avg ~200). The current mean is ~300. The date (March 4th) and product (Womens T-shirt) suggest a seasonal ramp-up into spring.\n4. **Strategy**: Target inventory for (L+1) = 2 periods of demand. At 300 units/period, the target is 600. Current pipeline (360 + 300) = 660 units. This suggests we are slightly over-supplied based on the current mean. However, OR recommends 160 units.

However, P2 order (360 units) should have arrived in P3 (if L=1) or P4 (if L=2). Since it is P5 and no arrival occurred in P3 or P4, the P2 shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed. Demand Analysis: The product is a basic T-shirt in March (spring), showing a clear upward trend. Pre-game demand was ~200, but recent periods (P2-P4) average 301. OR Algorithm Analysis: OR recommends only 10 units because it counts the full in-transit (820) against a base-stock level calculated using the promised L=2 and historical averages that don't capture the recent surge. If we assume the P2 order is lost, our actual pipeline is only 460 units (P3+P4). To cover demand for P5 and P6 (L+1 periods) at ~300 units/period, we need ~600 units.

Current In-transit total is 1050 units, consisting of orders from Period 7 (450), Period 8 (300), and the new order from this period. 2. Demand Analysis: The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. As we are in April (Period 9), demand for lightweight jersey basics is surging. Historical demand in the last two periods (364, 372) is significantly higher than the initial samples (mean ~200) and the mid-game average (~280). Current demand is trending toward ~380-400 units. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. The 450 units ordered in Period 7 (2 periods ago) should arrive during Period 9 (Step 2) and be available for the Period 9 demand. However, given the high stockout frequency and demand growth, we must ensure the pipeline covers 3 periods of lead-time safety. 4. OR Recommendation Adjustment: OR recommends 0 because it sees 1050 in-transit against a historical mean that hasn't caught up to the recent surge. I will override this. We need to maintain a pipeline that supports ~400 units/period. Over the next 3 periods (L+1), we expect ~1200 units of demand. Current pipeline (1050) is slightly short.

Lead-time Inference: Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 1, P2: 3, P4: 2, P5: 3, P6: 2). Based on this, the P7 order (450 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 10 (L=3), but is not yet available for the Period 10 decision. Demand Analysis: The product is a lightweight T-shirt. As of mid-April (2019/04/15), we are entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand has recently averaged ~370 (Period 8 saw 372). Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is heavily skewed by the massive 'In-transit' figure, which includes a lost shipment (P3) and doesn't account for the high likelihood of stockouts due to the 0 on-hand status. To cover Period 11 and 12 demand (approx. 740 units) while accounting for lead time volatility, I need to ensure the pipeline is robust. Although 1100 units are 'active' in transit, the immediate stockout in P10 is unavoidable.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (Periods 7-10) averages ~329 units, with a peak of 372. As this is a lightweight jersey T-shirt and we are in late April (Spring/Summer season), demand is expected to remain high or increase. Pipeline evaluation: Order 7 (450 units, placed 4 periods ago) and Order 8 (300 units, placed 3 periods ago) should have arrived by now based on the observed L=1-3 range; their absence suggests potential shipment loss or significant delays. Excluding the likely lost Period 3 order, the active pipeline is 1,400 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on a promised lead time of 2 and a massive (but likely unreliable) pipeline. Given the high stockout frequency (0 units sold in Periods 9 and 10), I must order to ensure coverage for the next 3 periods (L+1) assuming a demand of ~350/period (~1,050 total).

However, calculating pipeline as P10 and P11 only (since P7 is likely lost), we have 550 units in reliable transit. Demand Analysis: Demand is surging significantly as we move into May (late spring). Period 11 demand was 564, a record high, likely due to warming weather for this 'lightweight jersey T-shirt'. The previous regime of ~370 has shifted to ~500+. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it includes the likely-lost P7 shipment (450 units) in its pipeline calculation. If P7 is lost, the current pipeline (550) + on-hand (86) = 636 units.

Using a base-stock logic for a 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods of coverage), we need roughly 1500 units in the system.

Demand Analysis: We are in a late-autumn regime for this T-shirt SKU. Demand has dropped from ~140 in September to ~85 in the most recent period. The average over the last 5 periods is approximately 123 units. Lead Time: Observed actual lead time recently is 1 period (P32 arrived P33, P34 arrived P35). Strategy: We need to cover demand for Period 36 and 37 (L+1). Total requirement is ~250 units (125 * 2). Current effective inventory is 15 (on-hand) + 150 (P35 order, expected L=1).

  "rationale": "The supply chain for this T-shirt remains highly unreliable with a significant portion of the in-transit inventory (3200 units) being confirmed lost from orders placed earlier in the year. However, recent arrivals (P39 arriving in P42, P41 arriving in P42) show that the current logistical lead time for new orders is approximately 1-3 periods. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn regime of approximately 70-100 units per period, with a slight spike to 109 in Period 42. Current on-hand inventory is 30 units. The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated (and mostly lost) pipeline inventory. To maintain a safe service level and cover the next 2-3 periods of demand (approx. 210 units) while accounting for the current 30 units on hand and the single reliable order in the pipeline (100 units from Period 42), I will place an order for 100 units to ensure continuity in case the Period 42 order is delayed or lost.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in a low-demand winter regime (~70 units/period). Supply chain reliability remains a major concern; the 'In-transit' balance of 3300 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments from earlier periods (P3-P35). However, recent orders have been arriving with lead times of 1-3 periods (e.g., P41 arrived in 1 period, P39 arrived in 3 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Period 44's order of 100 units is expected to arrive between Periods 45 and 47. Given that the game ends at Period 47, and we currently have zero stock to satisfy Period 45 demand, a small order is necessary to cover the final periods. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely due to the inflated 'In-transit' figure, which the OR agent cannot distinguish from lost stock. I will order 100 units to ensure availability for the final two periods, accounting for the high probability that older 'in-transit' units will never arrive.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU '610776002' (T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn/early-winter demand regime, averaging approximately 60-70 units per period. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the current pipeline inventory (3300 units) is massive compared to demand. However, historical audit and carry-over insights confirm that over 3100 units of that 'in-transit' balance are lost shipments from early periods (P3, P7, P12, P17, etc.) and should be ignored. Reliable lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. Looking at the reliable pipeline: we have 100 units from P44 (L=2) and 100 units from P45 (L=1) still in transit. With on-hand inventory at 36 and expected arrivals from P44/P45 sufficient to cover the next 2-3 periods of demand (~70 units/period), I will place a small order of 70 units to maintain the cycle and guard against the high 1-3 period lead time volatility, ensuring we don't stock out in P48/P49 if demand slightly ticks up during the Christmas/New Year week.",

In the previous period (P46), two orders arrived (P44 and P45), totaling 200 units, which replenished the stock. There is also an order of 70 units from Period 46 in transit, likely to arrive in 1-3 periods. Given the high reliability of the supply chain's loss rate (over 3000 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost) and the current inventory surplus relative to the low seasonal demand, the OR recommendation of 0 units is appropriate.
