Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Historically, demand over the last 5 periods has shown an upward trend (148 to 308). The most recent demand (308) is significantly higher than the average. Given the date (Feb 11), we are moving into the spring season where basic lightweight t-shirts typically see increased demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods). Using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 captures the recent surge (avg ~234 per period) better than the long-term average, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to meet this new regime while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's basic T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but is currently showing a significant upward trend. Historical demands were [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], and the most recent Period 1 demand was 266. This suggests a clear shift from the earlier mean (approx 160) to a new level (approx 270-300). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (356 units) was placed in Period 1 and is subject to a 2-period promised lead time (expected arrival in Period 3). To manage this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime [233, 308, 266], ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level. L is kept at default (2) as no deliveries have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current history shows a significant upward trend in demand: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308 (pre-history) followed by 266 and 316 in Periods 1 and 2. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is approx 297, which is notably higher than the long-term average. Lead time analysis: An order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (visible at Period 3 start), confirming an actual lead time (L) of 1 period, which is shorter than the promised 2. To prevent stockouts during this growth phase, I am setting L to 1 based on recent observation and using a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~300 units/period). This results in a mu_hat covering (1+L)=2 periods of demand (~600 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period (P1 order arrived P2); Demand regime shift detected: last 3 periods avg ~297 vs pre-history avg ~204 (+45%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's t-shirt (everyday basic). Current demand shows a significant upward trend compared to initial historical data. Demands for P1-P3 were 266, 316, and 306 (avg ~296), while pre-history avg was ~204. I am currently out of stock (ending OH=0) because the P2 order hasn't arrived. Although P1 arrived in 1 period, the promised lead time is 2. The P2 order (331 units) was placed in P2 and should arrive in P4 (lead time 2). The P3 order (255 units) should arrive in P5. My pipeline inventory is 586 units. Given the recent demand jump and the stockout in P3, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the ~300 units/period regime. For lead time, I will use 'explicit' value 2 to be conservative despite the P1 lead time of 1, as the P2 order did not arrive in 1 period (it would have been reported in the P3 conclude if it had).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: avg increased from ~204 to ~296 (+45%); Lead time is inconsistent, P1 took 1 period, but P2 did not arrive in 1 period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday T-shirt. Current demand data shows a clear regime shift: pre-history average was ~204, but the last 5 periods (including game history) average 297.8 (266, 316, 306, 283, 308). Despite a promised lead time (L) of 2, the order from Period 1 arrived in 1 period. However, orders from Periods 2 and 3 are now overdue if L=1, and the Period 2 order (due P4 if L=2) has not arrived yet. This indicates lead time instability or potential loss. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 926 units are in-transit (Orders from P2, P3, P4). To ensure the OR backend covers the (L+1) demand window during this stockout, I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the sustained higher demand of ~298/period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~298 units/period (Periods 1-5); Lead time is volatile: P1 arrived in 1 period, but P2 is delayed (not arrived by start of P5, exceeding 2 periods).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Product is a Women's T-shirt, a basic item. Historical demand shows a stable regime since Period 1 (mean \u2248 285). Inventory status: 79 on-hand, 595 in-transit. Lead time is highly volatile: P1 arrived in 1 period, while P2 took 3 periods. P3 and P4 orders (total 595 units) are currently in-transit. P3 is now 3 periods old (overdue relative to promised 2). Given the volatility, I will use L=3 to ensure the safety stock covers a longer tail. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (avg 284.6, std 26.6) while ignoring the lower pre-history values. This set of parameters ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the observed delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1=1, P2=3. Current regime demand (P1-P5) stabilized at mean ~285 (std ~27).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, which typically exhibits stable demand. In the current regime (Periods 1-6), demand has stabilized with a mean of ~282 units. Historical lead times have been volatile: P1=1, P2=3, P4=2. The order from Period 3 (255 units) is now overdue (4 periods since ordering), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. To account for this uncertainty and the volatile lead time, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using recent_N=6 to capture the current stable regime (avg ~282). This results in a mu_hat of (1+3)*282 = 1128. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility (~22.6 per period, scaled by sqrt(1+3)). This approach provides a safety buffer against the missing P3 shipment while avoiding excessive overstocking if it eventually arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Shipment from Period 3 (255 units) is now 4 periods overdue and potentially lost; Lead time remains highly volatile (range 1-3 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 907 units in-transit. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday T-shirt) remains strong, with a recent average of ~294 units over the last 7 periods (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270, 364). The most recent demand (364) indicates an upward trend as we move into April. Lead time is highly volatile: P1=1, P2=3, P4=2. Critically, the P3 order (255 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P3, now P8 start) and is likely lost. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given the volatility and the lost shipment, I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~294) across 3 periods (L+1), totaling 882. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility in demand to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (255 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed, no arrival). Demand remains elevated above pre-history, averaging ~294 units since Period 1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is currently in a high-demand regime compared to pre-history. Since Period 1, the average demand is ~303.6 units, with recent periods (P7-P8) showing a spike to ~368 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show volatility (1, 3, 2, 2). Specifically, the order from Period 3 (255 units) is confirmed lost, which has depleted on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 609 units consists of the orders from P7 (323) and P8 (31), plus the lost P3 order (255). Because the OR backend treats the lost 255 units as 'pipeline inventory' that will eventually arrive, it will under-order unless I adjust the lead time parameter 'L' to effectively ignore that lost inventory or increase mu_hat. By setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised and most frequent actual value), I ensure the backend uses the correct horizon. However, to account for the lost stock and the recent demand spike, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Demand over the (L+1=3) period horizon is forecasted at ~1,050 units (350 per period) to reflect the recent uptick and ensure the service level is maintained despite the stockout at the end of P8.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in P7-P8: average increased to 368 units vs previous game average of 282 (+30%).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (mid-April), demand has returned to the stabilized regime (~270-300 units) after a brief spike in P7-P8. The average demand since Period 1 is 300 units. The order from Period 3 (255 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, we have 778 units in transit (P7, P8, P9). While the shipment from P7 (323 units) was expected to arrive in P9 (if L=2), the observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0). I am using 'calculate' for lead time to capture this historical variance. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the entire active game regime (P1-P9), which averages 300 units/period\u2014significantly higher than the pre-history mean of 204. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained higher demand level while smoothing out the transient P7-P8 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility observed during the game compared to pre-history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 9 demand (271) suggests the P7-P8 spike was transient; the sustained game-long mean (P1-P9) is 300 units (+46% vs pre-history).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained consistently elevated since the start of the game, with a mean of ~298 units (Periods 1-10), compared to the pre-history mean of ~204. Period 10 demand was 310 units, aligning with this trend. Lead times have been highly volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods observed), and the order from Period 3 (255 units) is definitively lost. Currently, there are 1033 units in-transit (from Periods 7, 8, and 9). The promised lead time is 2, but the average of observed lead times is (1+3+2+2)/4 = 2.0. However, given the lost shipment and the 0 on-hand inventory, I will set L to the promised 2 but use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand regime (avg ~298) vs the pre-history data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand plus safety stock for the lead time duration.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for this t-shirt shows a significant spike in Period 11 (564 units), likely driven by late April/early May seasonality or promotional activity. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has increased to approximately 376 units, compared to the earlier game average of ~285. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory is 578 units (orders from P7 and P10/P11 context are pending, though P3 is confirmed lost). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~2.2). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev ~115). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect the average observed lead time (2.2) rather than the optimistic promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected in Period 11 (564 units); the 5-period average (P7-P11) has shifted to ~376 units (+32% vs previous regime). Lead time remains volatile but averages ~2.2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is entering peak demand as we move into May. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand analysis shows a significant upward shift: the last 5 periods (P8-P12) average 388 units, compared to the game-long average of 330. Specifically, P11 and P12 showed high demand (564 and 424 units respectively), likely due to the onset of warmer spring weather. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.2. The order from Period 3 (255 units) is confirmed lost. With 887 units currently in-transit (P7, P12 orders) and a lead time of 2-3 periods, we must set parameters to account for the current demand regime. I am choosing N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent spring surge (averaging ~388 units/period) while using 'calculate' for L to account for the observed lead time variability which averages above the promised 2 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher safety stock needed for both demand spikes and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand surge confirmed: Period 8-12 average demand is 388 units, a 35% increase over the early-game average (~288).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's lightweight T-shirt. Current date is mid-May, aligning with the seasonal 'Spring demand surge' identified in Carry-over insights. Demand history shows a significant shift: pre-history average was ~204, early-game (P1-P6) average was ~282, and the recent regime (P7-P13) has averaged ~373 units per period. The most recent demand (P13) was 304, slightly below the recent mean but consistent with a higher regime than early periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 913 units in-transit (P7 order of 323 is likely lost, but orders from P12 and P13 are expected). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. Given the seasonal peak and recent volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the elevated Spring demand regime (approx 373 units/period) and for sigma_hat to reflect the higher variance seen in recent spikes (e.g., P11 demand of 564). For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical average lead time which is slightly above the promised 2 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Current date is May 20, 2019. We are experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift: pre-history average was ~204, Period 1-7 average was ~285, and Period 8-14 average has surged to ~382 (+34% from the previous regime). This aligns with seasonal spring/summer demand for jersey T-shirts. Lead times are volatile (1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2), averaging approximately 2.16 periods; the P3 order is confirmed lost. My objective is to satisfy this elevated demand regime while accounting for the lead time of 2. For Period 15, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand spring regime (avg ~382) and for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. L=2 is maintained as the primary expectation despite volatility to avoid over-ordering during transit gaps.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P8-P14): average demand is ~382 units/period, a 34% increase over the early-game average (~285), likely due to seasonal spring/summer relevance of the T-shirt category.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', which is currently in high seasonal demand as we enter June (late Spring/early Summer). Recent demand history (P11-P15) shows a significant shift, with an average of 433 units/period, compared to the earlier regime of ~285. Specifically, the last three periods (P13-P15) have averaged 392 units despite zero stock for much of that time. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is heavily reliant on the 1268 units in-transit. A shipment from Period 12 (309 units) is now 1 period overdue (promised L=2, now P16, ordered P12). Given the historical volatility (lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and one lost shipment), I will use 'recent_N' for lead time with N=5 to capture the average of 2.2-2.4 observed recently. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P11-P15) to capture the current high-demand seasonal regime (~433/period). For sigma_hat, N=5 will provide a volatility estimate consistent with this new regime to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: P11-P15 average demand is 433 units (+52% vs early game), coinciding with late Spring/early Summer seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3 (Period 17). We are in a high-demand seasonal peak for T-shirts (Womens Everyday Basics). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is ~433 units, representing a significant shift from earlier periods. The Period 3 order (255 units) and Period 12 order (309 units) are now confirmed lost/overdue, as they have exceeded their lead times by several periods (P12 is 5 periods past its order date). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~2). To address the sustained high demand and account for stockouts/lost units, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the 433 avg demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for the same period to capture recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time (approx 2.1 periods) to ensure the pipeline covers the necessary duration.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Shipment from Period 12 (309 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (5 periods since order, no arrival). Demand regime (P11-P16) remains stable at a high average of ~433 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer seasonal demand phase. Period 17 observed a significant demand spike to 640 units, the highest in the game, confirming a sharp upward trend as temperatures rise. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 450 units, up from the ~433 average noted in the previous regime. Regarding lead times, the shipment from Period 12 (309 units) is officially lost (5 periods elapsed). Recent successful arrivals (P15 order arrived P16, P13 order arrived P15) show lead times of 1 and 2 periods, but the frequent loss of shipments (P3 and P12) necessitates a higher safety stock. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the accelerated summer demand (mean ~450) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility (std ~120). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical lead time while the OR backend's cap helps manage the risk of over-ordering during stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand acceleration: Period 17 demand (640 units) marks a new peak; P13-P17 average is ~450 units (+55% vs early game). Second major shipment loss confirmed: Period 12 order (309 units) failed to arrive after 5 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer seasonal demand phase. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: the average demand over the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is approximately 446 units, compared to the early-game average of ~285. Period 17 saw a massive peak of 640 units. Inventory management is currently critical as we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have two confirmed lost shipments (P3 and P12). The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.1). To capture the current high-demand seasonal plateau while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand levels (Avg ~480 for P14-P18). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average of ~2.1 periods, ensuring the OR engine builds sufficient safety stock for the current stockout situation and lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Sustained summer demand plateau: P14-P18 average demand reached 473 units (+65% vs pre-history). Lead time remains volatile but averages 2.1 periods across all successful deliveries.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, the peak of summer seasonality for womens t-shirts. Demand has remained consistently high, with a recent 5-period average (P15-P19) of 475 units. Despite the high demand, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the 'bullwhip effect' and recent order capping by the OR backend. The pipeline inventory (1059 units) includes orders from P17 (78), P18 (80), and P19 (14). To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficiently large order to meet this summer peak and recover from the stockout, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current regime of ~475 units/period. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the average of successful deliveries (~2.1 periods) is close to the promised 2 periods, though volatility remains a factor. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high volatility (std ~94) observed during this summer surge.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is in its peak summer demand season. Demand in the last 10 periods (P11-P20) has averaged approximately 430 units/period, significantly higher than the early-game average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 1061 units. However, recent delivery history shows extreme unreliability: orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20 are all technically within or slightly past the promised 2-period lead time window but haven't arrived, and historical evidence shows multiple lost shipments (P3 and P12). Because the OR backend's 'cap' formula is tied to the mean, setting an 'explicit' high mu_hat is necessary to allow the system to order enough to meet summer peaks despite the high in-transit volume. I am setting mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (approx 435 units/period * (1+L)) and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (approx 100 per period). This high target helps overcome the 'cap' and ensure the system attempts to restock if current in-transit units fail to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P11-P20) remains active with an average of ~430 units/period. Lead time reliability is extremely low, with a history of lost shipments (P3, P12) and frequent delays, necessitating higher safety stock parameters.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the product (Womens T-shirt) is in the middle of its peak summer season. Demand has been highly volatile but elevated, with a recent 10-period average (P11-P20) of approximately 430 units. The most recent demand (P21) was lower at 232, but given the summer seasonality, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains problematic: P12 (309 units) and P17 (78 units) orders appear lost/heavily delayed, and recent arrivals (P18 order arriving in P21) confirm a 3-period lead time is common. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand summer regime, and keep L at the promised 2 periods while allowing the OR backend to handle the variance, as the explicit 'in-transit' volume (1371 units) is already high and the cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering if the pipeline suddenly clears.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Order from Period 17 (78 units) is now 5 periods overdue and likely lost, similar to the Period 12 loss. Demand remains in a high-volatility summer regime; while P21 was lower (232), the seasonal average since P11 remains ~410 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for this women's jersey T-shirt. While demand in the last two periods (P21: 232, P22: 238) has dipped compared to the June peaks (>400), the seasonal relevance remains high. Historical evidence shows a pattern of lost shipments (P3, P12, and now P17 is 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost), and volatile lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. With 152 units on hand and 992 in-transit (reflecting several recent large recovery orders), the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to protect against the frequent stockouts caused by supply instability. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the elevated seasonal mean (approx 390 units/period) while smoothing the recent two-week dip. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=12) to account for the high volatility seen during the summer surge (demand ranging from 232 to 640). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, which incorporates the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Shipment from Period 17 (78 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed, no arrival). Demand regime remains volatile; recent two-period dip (avg 235) vs previous 10-period summer average (410) suggests potential mid-summer fluctuation or early tapering, but safety stock remains critical due to supply unreliability.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (July 22), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in the mid-to-late summer phase. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift: from Period 11 to 20, average demand was ~430 units. However, the last three periods (P21-P23) have shown a significant drop to an average of ~227 units (232, 238, 212). This likely signals a seasonal tapering as the peak summer demand for basic t-shirts subsides. Regarding supply, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). The shipment from Period 17 (78 units) is confirmed lost (exceeding 5 periods). Shipments from P19 (14 units) and P20 (2 units) are also significantly overdue and likely lost. The pipeline now consists of the P22 order (11 units). Given the new lower demand regime and the high unreliability of lead times (averaging 2.2 periods but with frequent losses), I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 3 periods of the recent lower demand (N=3, avg ~227), and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the volatility of the transition from peak to taper.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: average demand decreased from ~430 to ~227 units (-47%), signaling seasonal tapering. Continued supply unreliability: shipments from P17, P19, and P20 are confirmed or likely lost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt (610776002) has clearly entered a post-peak seasonal decline as of Period 21. After a summer peak averaging over 400 units, the last 4 periods (P21-P24) have averaged 222 units. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand level and prevent excessive stock-building. Regarding lead times, the supply chain remains highly unreliable. Shipments from P3, P12, P17, P19, and P20 are all confirmed or highly likely lost (all 5+ periods overdue). Successful arrivals show a volatile range of 1-3 periods. Because of the high frequency of lost shipments and the 2.1 period average for those that do arrive, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the likely delivery delay and high risk of stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture the higher volatility seen throughout the active summer season and the recent transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~430 to ~222 units (-48%), indicating end-of-summer tapering. Supply reliability is critical: 5 shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) are confirmed lost, while successful deliveries vary between 1-3 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019/08/05. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is exiting its peak summer season (indicated by the sharp demand drop from ~430 units to ~210 units starting Period 21). The latest demand (Period 25) is 154 units, continuing this downward trend as late summer/fall approaches. 

Inventory/Supply Analysis: Supply reliability is poor. Five orders (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is 1117 units, but much of this is likely 'ghost' inventory from the confirmed losses of P17 (78), P19 (14), and P20 (2). The P25 order (136) is currently in transit. On-hand is 0.

Strategy: 
1. Demand: I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P21-P25) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak regime (average ~208 units). 
2. Volatility: I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's variance.
3. Lead Time: While the promised lead time is 2, the average fluctuates (1 to 3 periods). I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average of successful arrivals.

The high in-transit number (1117) will cause the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) to likely output an order of 0, which is appropriate given the on-hand stockout and the massive volume of units technically still 'in-transit' compared to the now-lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: average demand decreased from ~430 to ~208 units (-51%), confirming end-of-summer tapering for this T-shirt SKU. Supply unreliability remains high with 5 historical shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) confirmed lost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has clearly entered a post-summer tapering phase. As of Period 21, demand dropped significantly from the ~430 peak to a recent average of ~185 units (P21-P26). The current date is mid-August, confirming the end of the high-demand season. Supply reliability remains a severe issue, with five shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive pipeline of 1,117 units in-transit (partially due to the system or earlier large orders not arriving). However, because many in-transit units are likely 'lost' (P17, P19, P20 orders), the OR engine needs to compensate. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~185) and maintain an explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays and the need for higher safety stock to hedge against the high loss rate. This balance aims to avoid over-ordering during a downtrend while protecting against stockouts caused by unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: average demand decreased to ~185 units (-57% from summer peak) as of mid-August. Supply unreliability is critical: 5 total shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) are confirmed lost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the demand for this T-shirt SKU has significantly tapered from its summer peak (~430 units) to a late-season average of approximately 180 units over the last 7 periods, with the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) averaging only 125 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with five confirmed lost shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) and volatile lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Current in-transit inventory is 1117 units, which is extremely high (nearly 9x current weekly demand), likely containing several overdue/lost orders or excessive previous orders. To prevent overstocking during this clear seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the tapering regime (avg ~181). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays, providing a safety buffer in the base stock calculation, while the OR backend's capping mechanism should naturally limit new orders given the massive pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Average demand since Period 21 has dropped to ~181 units, with the most recent three periods (P25-P27) further declining to ~125 units, marking the end of the summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has entered a clear post-summer tapering phase. Since Period 21, the average demand has dropped to approximately 181 units, with the last four periods (P25-P28) averaging only 133 units. This confirms the transition from the high-summer peak (~430 units) to a much lower late-August/Autumn level. Supply reliability remains the primary challenge: 5 historical shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) are confirmed lost, which explains the high 'In-transit' figure of 981 units that are unlikely to ever arrive. Only orders from P21, P22, and P25 have arrived recently, with lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods. To account for this tapering, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (since the shift at P21) to capture the new mean of ~181. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower regime. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average of successful arrivals, acknowledging the lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering is stable: Period 25-28 average is 133 units, confirming the end of the summer peak. Total confirmed lost shipments: 5 (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-summer demand tapering phase. Average demand since the regime shift at Period 21 is approximately 174 units (P21-P29). However, more recent data (P26-P29) shows a more stable low-demand environment averaging 130 units. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a significant history of lost shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20). At the start of Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0. Although 'In-transit' shows 981 units, this likely includes the 5 confirmed lost shipments (approx. 750 units), meaning actual reliable pipeline inventory is much lower. To prevent over-ordering during this declining demand phase while accounting for supply unreliability, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (capturing the 130-unit mean) and recent_N=9 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the post-peak period. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2.1 period average of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~130 units/period (P26-P29), marking the full transition out of the summer peak. Supply reliability remains the primary risk, with over 75% of total units currently marked 'In-transit' likely being lost shipments from previous periods (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the SKU (a basic T-shirt) has transitioned from a high summer peak (avg ~430 units) to a stabilized late-season regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is approximately 133 units, confirming the shift identified in Carry-over Insights. Supply chain reliability remains extremely poor: 5 shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) totaling 742 units are confirmed lost/overdue by 5+ periods. These should be treated as permanent losses. The remaining 239 units in-transit are from more recent periods but given the history, safety stock is crucial. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-peak mean (~158) while acknowledging the recent stabilization around ~130. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile actual lead times (1-3 periods) rather than the promised 2.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized in a post-summer regime, averaging approximately 144 units per period over the last 4 periods (P28-P31). Although on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported 'In-transit' is 981 units, historical evidence confirms significant supply unreliability: orders from P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, and likely P23/P24 (if any were placed) have failed to arrive, totaling roughly 820+ units that are likely lost. Consequently, the backend's capped policy [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will result in zero orders because it views the 981 units as 'pipeline'. To trigger necessary replenishment and offset these phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1400, which effectively 'buys back' approximately 970 units of pipeline inventory (calculated as: target mu_hat \u2248 (actual_mu * (L+1)) + lost_units). This ensures the OR backend places a meaningful order to meet the current stable demand of ~140 units/period while accounting for the 2-period promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand stabilized at ~144 units/period (P28-P31). Cumulative lost shipments confirmed from P3, P12, P17, P19, P20; 'In-transit' figure is severely inflated by these lost units, requiring 'explicit' mu_hat adjustments to force replenishment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized in a post-summer regime, averaging approximately 140 units per period over the last five weeks (P28-P32). In-transit inventory is currently 1,420 units, but historical analysis confirms that orders from P3 (255), P12 (309), P17 (78), P19 (14), and P20 (2) are lost, totaling 658 ghost units. Furthermore, shipments from P23 (0 units ordered), P24 (0), P26 (0), P27 (0), P29 (0), P30 (0), and P31 (0) mean the only valid pending order is from P32 (439 units). Subtracting the 658 lost units from the 1,420 in-transit leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 762 units. However, to ensure the OR backend triggers an order if needed, I must adjust mu_hat to reflect the current regime (~140/period) and L to the observed average (~2.2). The backend formula [base_stock = (1+L)mu + z*sigma] will be used. Given the high volume of lost shipments, I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the pipeline is not overestimated by the backend, targeting a 3-period coverage (L+1).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30, 2019), the demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has stabilized in the post-summer trough. Recent demand (P28-P33) averages approximately 144 units per period. The inventory situation is complicated by significant supply unreliability: 981 units are marked 'In-transit', but historical tracking confirms that shipments from P3, P12, P17, P19, and P20 (totaling ~732 units) are lost. These phantom units mislead the OR backend's capped base-stock policy, preventing necessary replenishment. Period 33 saw the arrival of the P32 order (439 units) with a lead time of 1 period, leaving us with 292 units on-hand. Given the current average demand of ~144, our on-hand inventory covers approximately two periods. With a promised lead time of 2, we must ensure we don't stock out while accounting for the 'In-transit' inflation. I will set mu_hat explicitly to roughly (L+1) * 144 = 432. Since 'pipeline_inventory' in the OR engine includes the phantom 732 units, the engine will compute 'base_stock - pipeline' as a negative number or zero, effectively placing no order. However, since we currently have 292 units and demand is ~144, we are safe for this period. I will use a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current stable 144-unit regime and keep L at default.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Period 28-33 average demand is 144 units, confirming a stable baseline after the summer peak and initial tapering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized in a post-summer regime. The average demand from Period 28 to Period 34 is approximately 139 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 186 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 981 units is severely inflated by multiple confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20). Because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock to calculate the order quantity, it will not place any new orders if it believes 981 units are coming. To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the actual pipeline (e.g., pipeline + (L+1)*demand), I can force the backend to place a replenishment order. Current pipeline (981) + 3 periods of demand (~420) = 1401. I will set mu_hat to 1400 to trigger a necessary order for the next cycle, as current stock (186) will only cover about 1.3 periods. Lead time is set to 2 (promised), and sigma is based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand plateau confirmed (P28-P34): mean is ~139 units/period. Supply chain health check: 981 units in 'In-transit' are predominantly legacy lost shipments, requiring parameter overrides to maintain stock levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is stable in a post-summer plateau, averaging ~125 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35: 141, 135, 147, 106, 85). On-hand inventory is 101 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1238 is highly distorted by lost shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20 total ~752 units). Subtracting confirmed/likely lost units leaves ~486 units actually in transit (primarily the P35 order of 257). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a mean demand of 125/period plus safety stock. Target base stock = 125 * 3 + (Z * Sigma). With sigma ~25, target is ~450. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (1238), I set mu_hat to 1350 to force a net positive order that maintains the 125 units/period coverage while ignoring the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed at ~125 units/period (P31-P35). Pipeline inventory (1238 units) remains severely inflated by legacy lost shipments (approx 750 units), requiring 'explicit' mu_hat overrides to bypass the pipeline cap and maintain stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this T-shirt SKU has entered a stable post-summer plateau, with the last 6 periods (P31-P36) averaging ~116 units/period, showing a slight further decline from the previous 140s. Current date (Oct 21) is deep into autumn, reinforcing this low-demand expectation. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1278 units, which is heavily inflated by legacy lost shipments (confirmed losses: P3, P12, P17, P19, P20 totaling ~750 units, plus potential recent delays). Because the OR backend subtracts this entire pipeline from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is set explicitly high enough to bypass the pipeline cap. To ensure we have stock for the (L+1) = 3 period horizon (current P37 + 2 period lead time), we need approximately 116 * 3 = 348 units. However, to force the backend to place an order despite the 1278 'units' in transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the phantom pipeline plus the real required inventory. With On-hand at 17, and true pipeline likely near zero (given recent arrivals), I will set mu_hat high enough to trigger a replenishment that keeps us covered through early November.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for late autumn (Oct) confirmed at ~115 units/period (P34-P36). Supply reliability remains the critical constraint; pipeline inventory (1278 units) is ~60% phantom units from historical losses (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38 (late October), the SKU is in a post-summer demand plateau, averaging approximately 105 units/period over the last 5 periods. The primary operational challenge remains supply reliability and pipeline management. There is currently 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 1615 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments from Periods 3, 12, 17, 19, and 20, totaling roughly 750 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this inflated pipeline from its base stock calculation, it would naturally under-order or stop ordering entirely. To bypass this 'pipeline cap' and ensure replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 1200, which covers (L+1) periods of demand (approx 3 * 105 = 315) plus an offset to neutralize the phantom pipeline units, effectively forcing the backend to place an order to meet the actual demand of ~105/period. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the moderate volatility observed during this plateau phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for late autumn (Oct) confirmed at ~105 units/period (P34-P37). Supply reliability remains the critical constraint; pipeline inventory is ~45% phantom units from historical losses, requiring significant mu_hat overrides to maintain stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU (Women's T-shirt) is in a late-autumn demand plateau, with recent demand averaging ~91 units/period (P35-P38). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' count of 1615 units is severely inflated by approximately 750 phantom units from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20). If these units were real, the OR engine would stop ordering. To maintain stock for the upcoming period, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline inventory cap. Given a lead time of 2 and a current demand mean of ~90, a safe base stock (mu_hat) would typically be ~270 (3 periods). However, since the engine subtracts the full 1615 'In-transit', I will set an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1885. This targets a fresh order of ~270 units (1885 - 1615) to replenish stock, accounting for the 0 on-hand and ensuring coverage for the lead time plus review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for late autumn (Nov) confirmed at ~90 units/period (P35-P38). Supply chain 'In-transit' data remains unreliable with ~46% of units (750) confirmed lost, necessitating continued explicit parameter overrides to trigger replenishment.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a low-demand late autumn regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P35-P39) has averaged approximately 83 units per period, showing a steady decline from the October levels. The primary operational challenge remains the 'In-transit' inflation. The pipeline inventory of 1569 units includes at least 750 units confirmed lost from early-to-mid game orders (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20) and likely more from the erratic summer period. While the P37 order of 337 units arrived on time (L=2), the P35 (257 units) and P36 (40 units) orders are now overdue (4 and 3 periods respectively), suggesting they might also be lost or significantly delayed. To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I forecast demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at 85 units per period (255 total), but I must 'over-state' this value to offset the ~750+ units of phantom pipeline inventory that the backend subtracts from the base stock. I will set mu_hat to 1050 to ensure the safety stock logic accounts for current on-hand (276) while ignoring the dead pipeline units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but roughly 2-period average observed in successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for November confirmed at ~80-85 units/period, continuing the post-summer decline. Supply chain 'In-transit' figure remains unreliable with over 50% of units representing confirmed or highly probable losses (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, and potentially P35/P36).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' continues its seasonal decline, with the most recent four periods (P37-P40) averaging 79 units/period. The pipeline inventory (1569 units) remains highly unreliable due to significant historical losses (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, and P36). Specifically, the orders from P35 (257 units) and P36 (40 units) are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively, following the pattern of previous confirmed losses. The only reliable 'In-transit' units are likely the 291 units from P39. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the inflated 'phantom' pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window using the current mean (~80) and a safety buffer (z*sigma), then add back the estimated phantom inventory (~981 units from P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P36) that the backend will erroneously subtract. Target Base Stock = (3 * 80) + (1.64 * 1.73 * 20) + 981 \u2248 1280. This setting forces the backend to recognize that existing pipeline units are largely non-existent, ensuring we maintain on-hand stock for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late November confirmed at ~80 units/period. Cumulative lost shipments now include Period 35 (257 units) and Period 36 (40 units), both exceeding the 3-period maximum observed lead time, bringing total estimated phantom pipeline to ~1278 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 42 (Nov 25, 2019). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has stabilized in a late-autumn regime, with an average of approximately 65-70 units per period over the last 3 periods (P39-P41). On-hand inventory is 140 units, which covers about two periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1569 units is extremely unreliable. Based on historical data, shipments from P3 (255), P12 (309), P17 (78), P19 (14), P20 (2), P35 (257), and P36 (40) are confirmed or highly probable losses, totaling approximately 955 'phantom' units. Furthermore, P37 arrived in 2 periods, but the P39 order (291 units) is still in transit. To prevent the OR backend from being misled by the inflated pipeline and stopping orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1200. This value accounts for (L+1) demand at the current regime (~75 * 3 = 225) plus a significant offset to neutralize the ~950 phantom units in the pipeline (225 + 950 \u2248 1175). This ensures the base stock calculation remains high enough to trigger new orders as the 140 units on-hand deplete.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Supply chain 'In-transit' remains severely inflated by legacy losses; estimated phantom pipeline is ~955 units (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P36). Demand regime for late November/early December is stable at ~70 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2), we are in a low-demand winter regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P38-P42) averages ~79 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1278 units is severely compromised by legacy lost shipments from P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, and P36. Specifically, orders from P35 (257 units) and P36 (40 units) are now 7-8 periods old, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, confirming they are lost. The only 'real' pipeline units were from P39, which arrived in P42. Current on-hand is 322 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of current demand (~79 units/period). Given the 2-period promised lead time and 1-period observation delay, we need to maintain roughly 3-4 periods of stock. To prevent the OR backend from halting orders due to the 1278 'phantom' units in the pipeline (which would trigger the pipeline cap), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to signal that the on-hand inventory is sufficient for now but must be monitored. Since current on-hand (322) > (L+1)*demand (3*79=237), no immediate order is required, but we must ensure the backend doesn't think we are overstocked by 1000+ units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed losses for Period 35 (257 units) and Period 36 (40 units) as they have exceeded 6+ periods without arrival. Total phantom pipeline inventory is now estimated at ~1278 units. Demand regime for December is stable at ~75-80 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019), the SKU (Women's Everyday T-shirt) is in a stable late-autumn/early-winter demand regime. Recent demand (P40-P43) has averaged 76.5 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1278 units, which is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P36). Based on the 3-period maximum observed lead time, the 291 units from P39 arrived in P42, but nothing from P35-P36 ever arrived. Currently, on-hand inventory is 261 units, which covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand at the current rate (~76 units/period). Given that the remaining game length is only 4 periods (P44-P47) and the average lead time is ~2 periods, the current stock is sufficient to satisfy remaining demand without further ordering. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive (largely phantom) pipeline and potentially over-ordering or under-ordering due to logic caps, I will set mu_hat explicitly to match the expected demand for the remainder of the horizon, while allowing the current on-hand to deplete. Since on-hand (261) > (L+1)*Demand (approx 228), the system should naturally place no new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand regime for December remains stable at ~75-80 units/period. Supply chain reliability is low, but current on-hand inventory (261) is sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game at current demand levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47 (mid-December). Demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized in a low-demand winter regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) being approximately 72 units. The on-hand inventory is 206 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (45, 46, 47) even if no more shipments arrive. The 'In-transit' figure of 1278 is composed entirely of confirmed lost or severely delayed legacy orders (Periods 3, 12, 17, 19, 20, 35, 36) and should be disregarded. Since we have enough stock to finish the game without incurring further holding costs from new orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand baseline while ensuring no new orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, entering the final two periods of the game. The current date is December 23rd, and demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized at a late-year low, averaging approximately 60-70 units per period over the last three weeks (P43-P45). On-hand inventory is currently 142 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods (estimated at ~130 units total) without any further ordering. The 'In-transit' figure of 1278 is composed entirely of confirmed historical lost shipments (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P36) and should be ignored for replenishment logic. Given the game's end is imminent and stock is sufficient, the goal is to minimize holding costs by not placing additional orders. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current low demand regime while ensuring the base stock calculation does not trigger an order against the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game transition: On-hand inventory (142) is sufficient to satisfy the remaining 2 periods of demand (avg ~65/period). All remaining 'In-transit' units are confirmed losses.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final period of the game. Current on-hand inventory is 50 units. Historical demand for the most recent periods (P43-P46) has been 61, 55, 64, and 92, averaging approximately 68 units/period. The objective is to maximize reward R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Since this is the last period, any order placed now would arrive after the game ends (minimum lead time is 1-2 periods), thus incurring no sales but potentially increasing future holding costs if the game were to continue. However, more importantly, with 50 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~70 units, we are likely to sell out or end with nearly zero inventory, which is optimal for the final period. No new order is required. The 'In-transit' figure of 1278 units consists entirely of confirmed legacy losses (P3, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P36) and will not arrive. I will set parameters to ensure no new order is triggered by the OR backend.
