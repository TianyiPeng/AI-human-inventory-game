Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' white/lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows an upward trend [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. The date is Feb 11, 2019, which is early spring; demand for basic tees typically increases as we move out of winter. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no arrivals history yet, I will use the default method for lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 2 samples (233, 308) suggest a significant regime shift compared to the earlier baseline (~160); I will use recent_N=3 to capture this upward momentum while maintaining some stability. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the higher volatility seen in the recent spikes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' (610776002). Historically, demand for the last 5 periods was [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. In Period 1, observed demand was 266, confirming a moderate upward trend compared to the older mean. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 356 units in transit (ordered in Period 1). The promised lead time is 4. Given the stockout in Period 1 (sold 0 due to 0 starting inventory), we need to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current demand regime. Since we only have 6 total demand points and a clear upward shift starting around P4/P5 of history, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the recent higher demand (233, 308, 266, and the projected next value). This results in an average demand of approximately 250-270 per period. The OR engine will use this to calculate base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as there isn't enough evidence to deviate from the promised 4 yet.
