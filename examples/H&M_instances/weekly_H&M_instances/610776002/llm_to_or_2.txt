Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt). The history shows 5 demand samples: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. There is a visible upward trend in demand over the last two periods (233 and 308), suggesting a shift or seasonal growth as we enter mid-February. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent acceleration (average ~233.7) rather than the long-term average, ensuring we don't under-order during this growth phase. For sigma_hat, I'll also use 'recent_N' to reflect the higher volatility seen in recent spikes. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. The historical demand sequence [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] plus the actual Period 1 demand of 266 shows a clear upward trend. In Period 1, we ordered 296 units with a realized lead time of 0 (same-day arrival confirmed in P1 conclude), which suggests the promised L=0 is reliable for now. Given the rising demand (~233, 308, 266 in the last three observations), the 'default' mean (average of all samples: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266] = 215) will under-forecast. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent higher demand regime (avg ~269) to ensure the base stock is high enough to meet the current velocity. Since L=0, mu_hat represents 1 period of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the recent increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1204.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt (everyday basic). Current demand is on an upward trend (P1: 266, P2: 316), exceeding previous historical levels (mean ~200). In Period 2, we ran out of stock (ending inventory 0, sold 301 on demand of 316), indicating that the previous parameters underestimated the surge. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the recent growth in demand over the last 5 samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] and specifically the last two periods, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher regime (average ~286) while setting L to 0. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current high-velocity demand and minimize lost sales, which are costly ($4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: demand increased from historical average ~160 to recent average ~290 (+80%) over the last two weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Demand has significantly shifted from the pre-game history (avg ~160) to a much higher regime over the last three periods (266, 316, 306). The current average of this new regime is approximately 296 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). Given the stability of this new high-demand regime (3 consistent samples), I will use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the ~300 unit weekly demand while maintaining the required service level for a $4 profit / $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 4: last 3 periods avg 296 units vs historical 160 units (+85%). Lead time confirmed stable at 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand regime. Since the start of simulations (Period 1-4), demand has consistently been higher than the provided historical samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. Specifically, the last four periods have seen demands of [266, 316, 306, 283], averaging 292.75 units. This is a significant (+83%) shift from the pre-game mean of 160. Lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all four trials. Current on-hand inventory is 36 units. To maintain high service levels (critical when profit is 4x holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained high-demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the observed volatility in this new state. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Women's T-shirt) has entered a stable high-demand regime since Period 1. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is 284.6 units, which is significantly higher than the training data average (184.8). Recent demand data specifically shows [266, 316, 306, 283, 252]. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data in every period to date. Given the transition into spring (mid-March), demand for t-shirts is likely to remain elevated. Using recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this current regime accurately while smoothing recent fluctuations. This approach allows the OR engine to set a base stock level that covers one period of demand (L+1=1) with an appropriate service level safety buffer.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current data shows a stable high-demand regime since Period 1, following a jump from the pre-game historical average (~160). Over the last 6 periods (Period 1 to Period 6), the actual demand values are [266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 282 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed in every concluding message (P1-P6). As we move further into March, demand remains steady. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established higher-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant historical data. Since L=0 has been perfectly reliable, the 'default' method is appropriate for lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 1 is confirmed stable at an average of ~282 units (Period 1-6), significantly higher than the initial historical data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1212.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, and demand in Period 7 saw a significant spike to 364 units, likely driven by the start of spring (April 1st context). The existing carry-over insight noted a stable regime around 282 units, but Period 7's jump (364 vs. 316 previous peak) suggests a new upward shift or seasonal volatility. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 after stockout in Period 7, meaning demand was higher than the units on hand (303). I will use the recent 7 periods (the entire active game history) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-demand regime better than the long-term historical data. Given lead time is 0, the target base stock must cover Period 8's demand entirely.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 7 (364 units) vs previous regime avg (~282), indicating possible spring seasonality shift beginning April 1st.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a basic spring/summer garment. Since the start of April (Period 7), demand has surged from a stable average of ~282 units (Periods 1-6) to an average of 368 units (364 in P7, 372 in P8), representing a 30% increase. We have experienced stockouts (sold < demand) in the last two periods because the previous logic did not fully account for this seasonal acceleration. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this immediate April surge (average 368) and provide the OR engine with the necessary base stock to prevent further stockouts as temperatures rise.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand spike confirmed starting Period 7 (April): demand increased from ~282 to ~368 (+30%) for lightweight jersey product.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Lightweight Jersey T-shirt) has entered a spring seasonal regime starting roughly around Period 7 (late March/early April). Demand in the last three periods (P7-P9) has been 364, 372, and 271. While Period 9 saw a dip to 271, the overall context of spring seasonality for a lightweight jersey product and the strong performance in the two preceding weeks suggest that the mean demand should be anchored closer to this new higher level. To balance the service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~80% cycle service level), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent seasonal behavior (Avg: 335.6). Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 3 periods to ensure mu_hat reflects the current spring demand level while being responsive to the most recent data point.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring season (late April). Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: initial historical mean was ~160, which jumped to ~282 in February/March (Period 1-6), and has shifted again starting in Period 7 (April) to an average of ~329 units (364, 372, 271, 310). The demand spike in early April was likely driven by the start of warmer weather, and while Period 9 dipped, Period 10 recovered to 310. Given the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0), and the current inventory is only 73 units, we need to maintain a high service level to capture seasonal sales. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to define the current seasonal regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the April demand shift more accurately than the full history.

=== Period 11 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1480.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 11 saw a significant spike to 564 units, far exceeding the recent 'spring seasonal' average of ~368. This occurs on April 22nd, likely corresponding to a late April/early May peak for lightweight jersey t-shirts as warmer weather becomes consistent. The current stock is 0 due to the large stockout (sold 370 of 564 demanded). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To account for this new step-up in demand while maintaining a high service level given the $4/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost (target service level = 0.8), I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) calculation to a more reactive EWMA with gamma=0.6. This will prioritize the most recent outlier (564) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent further lost sales during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand spike observed starting Period 11 (Date: 2019/4/22): demand jumped to 564 units, suggesting a higher-intensity peak in late spring for basic jersey items compared to the early April baseline of ~368.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is exhibiting a strong late-spring seasonal climb. Following the primary spring shift in early April (avg ~368), we entered a high-intensity peak starting in Period 11 (2019/4/22) with demand spiking to 564, followed by 424 in Period 12. The average for this most recent regime (N=2) is 494 units. As we are now in early May (2019/5/6), demand for lightweight jersey items is expected to remain high or increase further. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 11, 8, 7, and 2, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N (N=2) method to capture this higher demand level (~494) and using explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during these spikes (std of 564 and 424 is approx 99). This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current peak demand while considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-intensity late spring peak confirmed: Period 11-12 average demand is 494 units, representing a 34% increase over the early April baseline of 368.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has shown significant volatility in May. After a high-intensity peak in late April (Period 11-12 average of 494 units), demand dropped to 304 units in Period 13 (May 6th). This suggests the late spring surge may be stabilizing or retreating to the early April baseline (avg ~368). Period 13 demand (304) is significantly lower than the previous two periods but still higher than the initial Q1 regime (~282). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent high-peak volatility while respecting the most recent drop (P11: 564, P12: 424, P13: 304; Mean=430). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility (sigma_hat), a recent_N=4 will be used to better estimate the standard deviation from the peak period onwards.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. We are in the middle of a late-spring demand regime for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Since Period 11 (late April), demand has shown a higher-intensity peak. Following the carry-over insight of a late spring peak, the average demand from Period 11 to Period 14 is approximately 431 units ((564+424+304+431)/4). Although Period 13 saw a dip to 304, Period 14 rebounded to 431. Given the product's lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set mu_hat to cover the immediate period's demand (L+1=1). Using a recent_N approach with N=4 captures this high-intensity peak regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in the last two periods. Lead time (L) remains 0. Sigma_hat is also set using the same recent 4-period window to capture current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in its late spring/early summer peak (May 27). Historical demand since mid-April (Period 11) has shown a significantly higher intensity regime. Over the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been: [564, 424, 304, 431, 442], resulting in an average of 433 units. While Period 13 saw a dip, the overall trend remains elevated compared to early Spring. As we are approaching June, I expect this higher demand to sustain. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N calculation with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand late spring regime while accounting for the recent volatility. This provides the OR backend with a more accurate baseline than the total historical average.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-intensity late spring regime confirmed: Periods 11-15 average demand is 433 units (vs early April avg of 368).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is into its peak summer seasonality (June 3rd). Recent demand analysis confirms a sustained high-intensity regime. Since Period 11 (late April), the demand samples are: [564, 424, 304, 431, 442, 435]. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 433 units. While Period 13 was a low outlier (304), the last three periods have been very stable at 431, 442, and 435 respectively (mean ~436). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To handle the high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding cost $1) and capture the current stable-but-high demand, I will use recent_N with N=6 to cover the entire late-spring/early-summer high-intensity window. This N-value smooths out the Period 13 outlier while reflecting the significantly higher mean compared to early April.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime remains stable: Periods 11-16 average demand is 433 units with 0-period lead time maintained.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10th (Period 18). We are in a high-intensity late spring/early summer regime for this jersey t-shirt. Period 17 saw a significant demand surge to 640 units (up from an average of ~433 in the preceding 5 periods), leading to a stockout. This spike likely reflects peak summer holiday shopping or a localized weather event. To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will base the new mu_hat on the average of the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 11-17), which is approximately 465 units per period. Using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat captures this sustained high-demand period while incorporating the recent stockout peak. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last few weeks. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed at Period 17 (July peak): Demand reached 640 units, indicating a move from the late spring baseline (~433) to a potential summer peak baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1540.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' (a lightweight jersey t-shirt) is currently in a high-summer peak regime. History shows a clear escalation: early April (Period 7) avg ~368, late April (Period 11) avg jump to ~433, and a recent high-intensity surge starting around Period 17 (July approach). Period 17 saw demand of 640 and Period 18 saw 419. While Period 18 was lower than Period 17, the seasonal context (June 17th) and the high average of the last 8 periods (approx 445 units) suggest we are still in a sustained high-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To bridge the OR engine's conservative historical averaging, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'late-spring to summer' regime shift (Periods 11-18), which aligns with the product category's seasonal peak. This ensures the base stock reflects the ~430-450 unit current demand baseline rather than the lower yearly average.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed: Period 11-18 average demand is approximately 445 units (vs early spring avg of 368), reflecting high seasonal demand for basic jersey t-shirts through June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in its peak summer season (late June). Demand history shows a sustained high-intensity regime starting around Period 11 (late April). The recent average demand (Periods 11-19) is approximately 455 units. Recent individual demands have consistently hovered around high levels: 424, 304, 431, 442, 435, 640 (spike), 419, and 439. Calculating the average of these last 9 samples (since the mid-regime shift at P11) yields 455.4. While Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640, the following periods returned to the ~430-440 range, suggesting that spike might be an outlier or a very short-lived peak. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this summer regime (since P11). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting L=0, mu_hat with recent_N=9, and sigma_hat with recent_N=9 will provide a robust target stock level for the current summer demand pattern while accounting for the high volatility seen in the last few weeks (std of last 9 is ~93).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime remains stable into late June: average demand for the last 9 periods (P11-P19) is 455 units, with a standard deviation of 92.7, maintaining the high-intensity demand for basic jersey items first observed in late spring.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in the peak summer season (July 1st). Since Period 11 (late April), the demand regime has shifted to a higher level, averaging 440 units with significant volatility (reaching up to 640). Although Period 20 saw a dip to 301, this appears to be a common fluctuation within the high-season regime rather than a trend reversal, as similar dips occurred in P13 (304). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this $4 profit/$1 holding cost item (target service level ~80%), I will use recent_N to capture the summer demand profile (P11-P20). N=10 is selected to cover the entirety of this high-intensity regime, smoothing out the recent low observation while respecting the underlying high seasonal mean and standard deviation.

However, the last two periods (Period 20: 301, Period 21: 232) show a sharp decline, suggesting the peak summer demand for this specific SKU is tapering off as the season progresses. The average of the last 3 periods is 324 units. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and current on-hand inventory of 294 units, we must avoid overstocking during this downward trend. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this immediate cooling of demand while maintaining the established lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease: Post-summer peak decline observed starting Period 20 (late June). Average demand dropped from ~450 units to ~324 units (-28%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 20-22) confirms a downward shift from the summer peak (~450 units) to a post-peak regime averaging ~257 units (301, 232, 238). This aligns with mid-July seasonality for a lightweight jersey t-shirt as summer clearance behaviors often begin. I am setting N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the inventory policy to this lower demand level, preventing excessive holding costs. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed through P22). On-hand inventory is 175 units, and a base stock calculation using the recent mean (~257) and standard deviation (~38) for a 0-period lead time will likely result in a small replenishment order to cover expected demand plus a safety buffer while acknowledging the higher service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding cost $1).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak regime confirmed starting Period 20 (late June): average demand decreased from ~450 to ~257 units (-43%) based on 3 consecutive periods of data.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to trend downward as the summer peak concludes. Starting around Period 20 (late June), we observed a significant drop from the ~450 unit average. Demand for the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 301, 232, 238, and 212, respectively. The average of these last four periods is approximately 246 units. This confirms a new 'post-summer' regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. To avoid overstocking in a declining demand environment, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower mean for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as using the whole history would heavily overstate the current seasonal demand. This setting allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that aligns with the current consumption rate while maintaining the required service level for a high-margin basic item.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer regime further stabilized at Period 23: Last 4 periods (P20-P23) average demand is ~246 units, a 46% decrease from the summer peak average (~455).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a post-summer peak regime for SKU 610776002 (a basic jersey T-shirt). Demand has significantly decreased from the summer highs (~455) and has stabilized over the last five periods (P20-P24). The demands for these periods are [301, 232, 238, 212, 207], yielding an average of approximately 238 units. This represents a sustained lower demand level as we move out of the peak summer season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with this established post-peak baseline, while setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer regime confirmed stable through Period 24: Last 5 periods (P20-P24) average demand is 238 units (std dev ~38), confirming a shift to a lower late-summer/early-autumn baseline for basic jersey items.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (610776002) has entered a post-summer seasonal decline that began in late June. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand has averaged 207 units, showing a significant drop from the summer peak average of 455. The most recent demand (P25) was 154 units, suggesting the decline may still be finding a floor or settling into an early-autumn baseline. The current inventory is 116 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage this lower demand regime while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current post-summer trend. This covers the entire period since the downturn was identified.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline further stabilized: Periods 20-25 average demand is 207 units (std dev ~52), confirming a sustained lower baseline for the autumn transition compared to the summer peak of 455.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the basic jersey t-shirt is continuing its post-summer decline. In Period 26, demand dropped to 102 units, the lowest observed since the start of the game. The current regime (since Period 20, late June) has shown a clear downward trend: demand in the last three periods (P24-P26) averaged approximately 154 units (207, 154, 102). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs during this off-peak phase, I am selecting recent_N=7 for demand parameters. This captures the full extent of the decline from late June through early August while providing enough data points to stabilize the mean and variance. The Lead Time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline intensified in Period 26: 3-period average (P24-P26) is 154 units, down from the P20-P23 average of ~246, confirming a continued transition to low autumn/winter baseline demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey t-shirt is continuing its downward trend as we move further into late August (Period 28, 2019/08/19). The summer peak is over, and demand has settled into a lower autumn transition regime. Over the last four periods (P24-P27), demand has been 207, 154, 102, and 120, averaging approximately 146 units. This is a significant drop from the previous summer average of ~450 and even the post-summer transition average of ~240 observed in July. The last three periods specifically show an average demand of 125 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new lower-demand baseline while allowing for slight variability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand autumn transition regime confirmed: Last 4 periods (P24-P27) average demand is 146 units, down from the post-summer average of ~246, representing a continued decline for basic jersey items as summer ends.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in a confirmed low-demand autumn transition regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has significantly decreased from the summer peak (~455) to a sustained lower level. Over the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has been 207, 154, 102, 120, and 158 respectively, averaging 148 units. This confirms the 'low-demand autumn transition' identified in the most recent carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current transition while avoiding excess inventory in a declining season, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this newest stable regime (P24-P28). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the current mean (~148) and the recent volatility, ensuring we cover immediate demand with minimal holding cost risk.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is showing a consistent seasonal decline as we enter September (Period 30). The demand regime has transitioned from a summer peak (~455 units) to a post-summer decline (~246 units) and finally into a sustained low-demand autumn/winter baseline. Since Period 26 (August), demand has averaged 130 units (102, 120, 158, 140). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this lower-demand phase, I am selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current baseline of ~130 units. This approach balances the risk of holding costs against a lower service level requirement in the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed starting Period 26: demand has stabilized at a new baseline average of 130 units (Periods 26-29), down from the late-summer average of 246.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Tilly jersey t-shirt) has stabilized into an autumn/winter low-demand regime. Since Period 26 (August), demand has consistently hovered around a lower baseline. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 133 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight identifying a shift to approximately 130 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To optimize inventory for this lower-demand period and avoid excessive holding costs (which are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the current stable regime (P26 onwards) rather than the volatile summer peak data.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which has passed its summer peak and is now in a stable autumn low-demand regime. Since Period 26 (August 5), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 127 units (102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141), with a standard deviation of approximately 20 units. This is much lower than the summer peak of ~450 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable low-demand baseline while filtering out the volatility of the summer transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter baseline confirmed: demand has stabilized at an average of 127 units (Periods 26-31) with low volatility (std dev ~20) following the post-summer decline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in the Autumn/Winter season (late September). The demand has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 26. Analyzing the recent history (P26-P32), the demand mean is approximately 134 units with a standard deviation of 18 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. For Period 33, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this stable 7-period regime (N=7). This approach balances the need to satisfy the current consistent demand level while minimizing holding costs for this basic item during its off-peak season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in the Autumn/Winter season (September 30). Demand has stabilized since Period 26 at an average of approximately 138 units (P26-P33: 102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135, 147), which is a significant drop from the summer peak but consistent with the current seasonal baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for the current baseline without overstocking as we enter October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime stabilized: Period 26-33 average demand is 136 units (std dev ~17), confirming a consistent late-year baseline for this basic jersey item.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, currently in the Autumn/Winter season (October 7th). Historical demand analysis confirms a stable low-demand regime starting around Period 26 (August). For the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has averaged 128.2 units with a standard deviation of 20.2. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 106, which is slightly below the regime average but within normal volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs in this stable, low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 to capture the entirety of this Autumn/Winter baseline. This balances the mean and standard deviation across the most relevant historical window.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Winter low-demand regime for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Previous carry-over insights identified a stable baseline of ~136 units (P26-P33), but the most recent two periods (P34 and P35) show a significant further softening, with demands of 106 and 85 units respectively. Period 35's demand (85) is the lowest recorded in the entire history. This suggests a seasonal wind-down as temperatures drop further in mid-October. Given the target service level (profit $4 vs holding $1), we should avoid overstocking in a declining period. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock to cover small fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in mid-October (P34-P35): demand dropped to an average of 95.5 units, down from the early autumn baseline of ~136 (-30%).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is currently in a late-autumn/winter period (October 21). Historical demand has shown a significant deceleration since Period 34. The average demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 91.7 units, down from the early autumn baseline of ~136. This pattern is consistent with a seasonal item (lightweight jersey T-shirt) entering the colder months. Period 36 demand was 84 units, and the preceding two periods were 85 and 106. To account for this sustained lower regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent demand level (~92 units) while maintaining a safe buffer for the 0-period lead time. The OR backend will balance the relatively low holding cost ($1) against profit ($4) to determine the optimal order to meet this lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime deceleration confirmed starting Period 34 (late October): 3-period average demand (P34-P36) is ~92 units, down from the earlier autumn baseline of ~136 (-32%), reflecting low seasonal interest in lightweight jersey items.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for current SKU 610776002 (T-shirt in lightweight jersey) is in a confirmed late autumn/winter deceleration phase as of late October. Demand has settled into a lower regime starting around Period 34. The last four periods (P34-P37) show demand of 106, 85, 84, and 109, resulting in an average of 96 units per period. This is a significant decrease from the early autumn baseline of ~136 units. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 37 due to a stockout (demand 109 > available 103), so I need to ensure the order covers this new baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this decelerated regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the jersey item in its off-season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a confirmed late-autumn/winter low-demand regime for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Since Period 34 (late October), demand has decelerated significantly. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 92.4 units (106, 85, 84, 109, 78), which represents a stabilization at a much lower level compared to the early autumn baseline of ~136. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand phase, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this most recent decelerated regime (P34-P38). The inventory is currently at 30 units on-hand with 0 in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late-autumn regime confirmed stable through Period 38: 5-period average demand (P34-P38) is 92.4 units (std dev ~13), confirming a sustained lower baseline for the winter season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (SKU 610776002) is in a sustained late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Since Period 34 (late October), demand has dropped significantly from the previous autumn baseline of ~136 to a new average of approximately 87 units over the last 6 periods (P34-P39: 106, 85, 84, 109, 78, 61). The most recent demand (P39) was the lowest yet at 61 units, suggesting the downward trend may still be settling. To align with this current regime, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this specific post-deceleration behavior. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. This approach helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering a seasonal item that is losing relevance as the temperatures drop.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/winter regime further stabilized at Period 40: average demand for the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is 87 units, down from the previous baseline of 136 (-36%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) has entered a stable late-autumn/winter low-demand regime. Since Period 34, demand has consistently averaged around 85-90 units, a significant drop from the early autumn baseline. The last three periods (P38-P40) demand values are 78, 61, and 69, resulting in a 3-period average of ~69 units. This suggests a deepening of the winter trough as we move into mid-November. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage costs and ensure availability, I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (starting around P34) while allowing for some historical context to protect against minor fluctuations. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect the relatively low volatility observed in this period. This approach will likely result in smaller orders, aligning stock levels with the reduced seasonal interest for this product type.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November demand deceleration confirmed: average demand for the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is ~69 units, showing a further decline from the late-autumn baseline of 87 units established in Period 40.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight jersey t-shirt, which is showing a clear seasonal decline as we enter late November. The environment is currently in a low-demand winter regime. The most recent demand samples are [78, 61, 69, 67], representing a stable but low baseline. The 3-period average (P39-P41) is 65.7 units, and the 5-period average (P37-P41) is 76.8 units. Given the 'Mid-November demand deceleration' noted in the carry-over insights, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this latest step-down. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. This strategy aims to minimize holding costs for this seasonal item while maintaining sufficient stock for the current low-demand period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Historical demand for this lightweight jersey t-shirt has shown strong seasonality: peaking in summer (~455 units) and steadily declining through autumn. A new lower-demand regime was confirmed starting Period 34 (avg ~87-92 units), with a further deceleration in mid-November to ~69 units. However, Period 42 showed a jump to 109 units. Given the date (early December), this is likely the start of a holiday-related demand spike or 'Cyber Week' effect rather than a sustained regime shift. The product is a basic item, so it may see some gifting interest. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent activity (avg ~82 units) while acknowledging the Period 42 spike, but I will use a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed in Period 42 (109 units), deviating from the mid-November baseline of ~69 units. Continued monitoring required to see if this persists through December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees lower demand in winter, punctuated by potential holiday spikes. Current demand history shows a recent average (P38-P43) of approximately 75.8 units, though Period 42 saw a holiday-related spike to 109 units followed by a drop back to 61 in Period 43. Given the approach of the peak holiday season (mid-December), a slight increase in demand variability and potentially mean demand is expected as customers shop for basics or gifts. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent winter baseline while remaining responsive to the holiday volatility observed in P42, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the transition from mid-November to early December, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the low baseline and the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility observed: Period 42 saw a +60% demand spike (109 units) relative to the mid-November baseline (~69 units), followed by a return to baseline in Period 43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16th (Period 45). Historical demand for this 'Women's Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' follows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in spring/summer, steady decline in autumn, and a low winter baseline. Recent demand (Periods 34-44) has fluctuated between 55 and 109 units. Excluding the brief 'holiday spike' in Period 42 (109 units), the last two periods have stabilized at a lower winter average (Period 43: 61, Period 44: 55). As we are now in mid-December, I expect demand to remain low or slightly decrease as the season transitions towards the absolute year-end. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-autumn/winter regime (P39-P44 average is ~69.6 units), which balances the higher November demand with the most recent December lows.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46). We are in the mid-winter/holiday season for item 610776002 (a lightweight jersey t-shirt). Historical demand since Period 40 (mid-November) has stabilized at a low baseline, with the exception of a single-period spike in Period 42 (109 units). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is 64.2 units (69, 67, 109, 61, 55, 64). Excluding the outlier spike from Period 42, the average is 63.2. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Given that it is currently the week of Christmas, demand for a lightweight 'Everyday Basics' t-shirt is expected to remain at this lower winter baseline or potentially dip slightly. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stable late-year regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for minor holiday-related fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline confirmed stable through Period 45: average demand for P40-P45 (excluding P42 spike) is ~63 units, representing the seasonal low for lightweight jersey items.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are at the end of the calendar year. Period 46 showed a demand spike to 92 units, which is likely a final end-of-year/holiday clearance or late holiday surge, deviating from the 'winter baseline' of ~63 units established between Periods 40-45. Historically, this product (lightweight jersey T-shirt) experienced a significant increase in demand starting in February (Period 1). Given that next period is effectively the start of January, I anticipate demand will remain slightly elevated compared to the mid-December lows but stay below the spring peak. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7: Periods 40-46) to capture the current winter average (approx 74 units) and volatility, while recognizing that the Period 46 surge might signal the end of the seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Late December demand surge: Period 46 demand (92 units) suggests a potential exit from the mid-winter trough (~63 units) or a holiday-affected anomaly.
