  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is a 'Tilly' women's basic T-shirt in lightweight jersey. This is a staple 'Everyday Basic' but tends to see increased demand as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere (Current date: Feb 11). b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples are [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], showing an upward trend (average ~205). The last two samples (233, 308) suggest a transition into a higher demand regime, likely due to seasonal shifts. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, I need to account for Period 1, 2, and 3. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: With an average demand of ~205 but recent spikes up to 308, I will target a stock level that covers 3 periods of demand plus a buffer for the upward trend. Forecasting ~250 units per period for the next 3 periods = 750 units. Since I start with 0, I will order 750 units to establish the pipeline and meet immediate needs once arrivals begin.",

In Period 1, 750 units were ordered and are currently in transit. Based on L=2, these units are expected to arrive in the arrival phase of Period 3 and be visible/available for sale in Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and I have 750 units in the pipeline. I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) before the next possible replenishment from an order placed now (in Period 2) would arrive (Period 5). Assuming demand persists at ~266 units/period, I need roughly 1064 units (266 * 4) to cover through Period 5. With 750 units in transit arriving in Period 3, I am currently facing a stockout in Period 2 and likely Period 3.

P13 saw a lower demand of 304, but this may be a temporary dip or stabilization before late-May/June summer peaks. Given the date (May 13), demand is expected to remain high (~400-500 range).

Current On-hand is 108. In-transit consists of P11 (400), P12 (500), and P13 (500), totaling 1400 (plus P7 which is lost).

In-transit consists of P17 (500), P20 (450), and P21 (0 units, but P19 was 0 and P20 was 450), totaling 1450 units in the pipeline (P17, P20, and the new P18 arrival that just cleared).

Specifically, the orders from Period 17 (500 units), Period 18 (500 units), and Period 20 (450 units) are all significantly overdue (8-12 periods ago) and are highly likely lost, given the longest successful lead time observed was 3 periods. The only 'live' in-transit stock potentially relevant is the 500 units from Period 17 and 18, but since they are so far past the lead time window, they are likely lost shipments. Even if one of these shipments arrived, it would more than cover the current low-demand regime (~135 units/period).

These units represent orders from Periods 12, 17, 18, and 20. Given the extreme delay (nearly 6 months), these shipments must be considered lost or permanently stalled. However, with 0 on-hand inventory and the possibility of a holiday demand bump in December, I need to attempt to re-establish inventory. Ordering 250 units covers roughly 3 periods of current demand (safety stock for the holiday period), while minimizing exposure to the high holding cost ($1/unit) if the 'stalled' units suddenly arrive or if the off-season demand remains low.",
  "carry_over_insight": "December demand regime: Period 42 showed an increase to 109 units, potentially signaling a minor holiday demand lift from the November low of ~67-70 units.",

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product 610776002 is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics). The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Historically, demand for this item is low in winter, but Dec 2 saw a slight spike to 109 units, likely due to early holiday shopping or promotions. (b) Demand regime: November was stable at ~67 units/period. December started with a jump to 109, then dropped back to 61 in Period 43. I expect demand to fluctuate between 60-110 units as we approach the holidays. (c) Lead time and Pipeline: The system has suffered a massive stall. No arrivals have been recorded since Period 21 (22 periods ago), despite 2,200 units being 'in-transit'. This includes older orders (P12, P17, P20) and a fresh order of 250 from P43. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit is massive at 2200. (e) Final logic: Because the supply chain is clearly broken or severely delayed (22 periods without arrival), ordering more units only risks extreme holding costs if the 'dam breaks' and everything arrives at once. However, I have zero stock. I placed a small order of 250 in P43; I will hold for this period to see if the P43 order or any backlogged units arrive. Given the game ends at Period 47, any new order placed now (P44) would arrive at the earliest in P46 or P47, leaving little time to sell through potentially large arrivals.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a basic item with high seasonality. Demand is currently in a deep winter low, having averaged ~62 units/period over the last two weeks (P43-P44), down from the minor holiday bump seen in P42 (109 units). The supply chain remains severely compromised: there have been zero arrivals for 23 consecutive periods (since P21), leaving 2,200 units in-transit (orders from P12, P17, P19, P20, and P43). The in-transit volume represents over 30 periods of demand at current rates. Given that the game ends in Period 47, any new order placed now (P45) would arrive in P47 at the earliest (assuming a 2-period lead time), which is the final period. Since there is a massive backlog that could arrive at any moment and current on-hand inventory is 0 because of the stall, adding more to the pipeline is illogical. I will maintain a zero-order strategy to avoid compounding potential holding costs if the stall resolves, while acknowledging that stockouts are likely to continue due to the supply failure.",

There are currently 2,200 units in-transit, including a recent order from Period 43 (250 units) which has now exceeded its promised lead time of 2 periods (it should have arrived in Period 45). Current demand is in a deep off-season trough, averaging approximately 60 units per period over the last three weeks. Given that the existing in-transit pipeline represents over 30 periods of current demand, placing additional orders would be financially reckless. The potential holding cost of the current pipeline ($2,200/period) far outweighs the potential profit ($240/period) if it were to arrive all at once.

Recent demand (Periods 44-46) has fluctuated between 55 and 92 units, with the uptick in Period 46 likely reflecting pre-holiday shopping or minor seasonal volatility. The most critical issue remains the massive supply chain failure: zero arrivals have occurred for 25 consecutive periods (since Period 21), despite an 'In-transit' balance of 2,200 units. This total includes 1,950 units from orders placed between Periods 12 and 20, and a more recent order of 250 units from Period 43 which is now overdue (promised lead time 2, actual elapsed 3). Given that 2,200 units represent over 20-30 periods of current demand and the inventory pipeline is completely stalled, placing further orders is illogical.
