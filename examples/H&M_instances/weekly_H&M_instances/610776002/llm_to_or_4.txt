Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows an upward trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. As this is the start of spring/summer basics season, demand is likely to remain elevated or continue to grow. On-hand and in-transit inventory are currently zero. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Setting L to default (4) as we have no historical arrivals yet. For mu_hat, the last 2 periods show a significantly higher demand regime (avg ~270) compared to the start of the sequence. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this upward shift while maintaining some stability. For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=3 will account for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the demand history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 356 units, but they are currently in-transit due to the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 266 units, which resulted in 266 lost sales because our starting inventory was 0. The historical demand data [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] plus the P1 demand of 266 suggests an average demand of around 215 units per period. The product is a women's basic T-shirt, which typically has steady demand but may see slight increases approaching spring. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of recent samples (including P1) provides a conservative but responsive estimate. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 samples to capture the slight upward trend in demand observations (233, 308, 266).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/02/25). The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, a staple garment. Demand in the first two periods (266, 316) is significantly higher than the pre-game historical average (approx. 205), indicating a strong upward trend or a higher baseline for the current season. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, while 677 units are in-transit (ordered in Periods 1 and 2). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the Period 1 order (356 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). At the start of Period 3, we have 4 periods of demand to cover before that first order arrives (P3, P4, P5, P6). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the recent high demand (avg 291) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this level of consumption. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture current volatility. Lead time 'default' is used as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a shift from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced 3 periods of lost sales because the lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3, none of which have arrived yet. Based on the 4-period lead time, the Period 1 order (356 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be reflected in the Period 6 start state. Historical demand (including the provided past samples and the 3 periods of game history) shows a mean of approximately 223 units (148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266, 316, 306). There is a clear upward trend in demand as we move into March, likely due to spring seasonality for T-shirts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent higher demand level (233, 308, 266, 316, 306, avg = 285.8). For L, I use the promised 4 periods. mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4) * 285.8 = 1429. sigma_hat will use the recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 samples is [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. However, looking at the game history (Conclude messages P1-P4), the realized demand values were [266, 316, 306, 283]. This indicates a shift to a higher demand regime compared to the early 'Past demands' provided. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 293. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 1371 in-transit (P1-P4 orders). Since we are in an 'Everyday Basics' category in early March, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as Spring approaches. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For L, I will use default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: demand increased to an average of ~293 units compared to earlier pre-game samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to pre-game data, with the last 5 periods showing demands of [266, 316, 306, 283, 252], averaging 284.6. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 104, while in-transit is 1151 (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Total pipeline inventory is 1255 units. With L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand. At the current average demand, 5 periods equals 1423 units. The OR backend will calculate the order size based on the gap between base stock and pipeline. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current active regime accurately.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a women's T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5, P2 order arrived in P6). Demand has stabilized since Period 1; the average demand across the last 6 periods is approximately 282 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270). The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~293, but recent samples (P4-P6) show a slight cooling (avg 268). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Pipeline inventory is healthy (1049 in-transit + 155 on-hand = 1204 units), covering roughly 4.3 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand regime since the game started. L will be set to 'calculate' as the observed lead times are consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The product is a women's everyday t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 7 periods averages ~294 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270, 364), confirming the regime shift noted in the carry-over insight. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Concluded shipments from Periods 1, 2, and 3 have all arrived precisely with a 4-period lead time. Order from Period 4 (344 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 8) and become visible at the start of Period 9. On-hand inventory is 141. Total in-transit is 953 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). To determine parameters: I will use L=4 (promised and confirmed). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand since Period 1 (~294 units/period), as the pre-game samples (avg 184) are significantly lower and no longer relevant. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across 3 consecutive arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Demand has shown an increasing trend over the last 3 periods (364, 372), which aligns with moving into the spring season in early April. The average demand since P1 is approximately 303.6 units, but the most recent 4 periods show a higher average and increasing volatility (avg ~317.7). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on 4 consecutive arrivals (P1-P4 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My on-hand (113) plus in-transit (966) equals 1079 units. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 captures the recent upward trend for the spring season while sigma_hat is set to the default to account for the overall variability observed so far. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's T-shirt, a basic item. Historical demand from Period 1 to 9 shows an average of ~300 units per week (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270, 364, 372, 271). However, the last average over 9 periods is 300, and over the last 3 periods (P7-P9) it is ~335. Demand appears to be trending slightly upwards as we move further into spring. In Period 9, we ran out of stock (sold 249 vs 271 demand), ending with 0 on-hand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals in P5-P9). Orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9 totaling 1263 units are in transit. The OR engine needs parameters to cover the (L+1) = 5 period window. Given the zero stock and slight upward trend, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~305 units per period for mu_hat. For sigma, I'll use the same window to reflect recent volatility. This should help the OR engine place an order that refills the pipeline to meet the sustained higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~305 units/period over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), representing a slight increase from the initial game average.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, and current total in-transit is 1418 units. However, we have experienced stockouts in Period 9 and Period 10 due to low arrivals (136 and 219 units respectively), which were the result of lower orders placed in Periods 5 and 6 when on-hand inventory was higher. Now, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 305-310 units over the last 5-6 periods. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand (P6-P10) mean is ~317.4. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly higher demand regime and its volatility. Lead time L will remain default as it aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is experiencing a significant demand spike. Period 11 demand reached 564 units, compared to the previous average of ~305. This coincides with late April, likely reflecting spring/summer seasonality for lightweight jersey items. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods (P9-P11). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend in demand (P11=564), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the high volume and increased volatility of this spring surge. Setting L to 'default' as 4 periods is consistently observed. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current high-demand regime during the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed in late April: Period 11 demand (564) is 85% higher than the previous 5-period average (305), indicating a seasonal shift into spring/summer.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a high-demand regime as of Period 11 (late April/early May), coinciding with the spring/summer season. Demand in the last two periods (564, 424) is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~305. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand=0) despite consistent lead times of 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. Given the seasonal surge, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility and volume. Lead time L is stable at 4 periods, which I will continue to calculate based on history.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Sustained high seasonal demand confirmed for May; demand in P11-P12 averaged 494 units, a 60%+ increase over previous baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (P14), a peak season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts. Demand has been volatile but elevated, with a recent 3-period average (P11-P13) of 430.7 units, significantly higher than the early game average of ~293. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently low (129 on-hand) due to stockouts in P9-P12, but we have a large pipeline (1922 units) following high orders in P12 and P13. For Period 14, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility spring/summer regime, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand remains in a high-volatility seasonal peak; 3-period average (P11-P13) is 430.7 units (+47% vs earlier baseline).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal period (late May) for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday T-shirt). Demand history shows a significant shift starting around Period 11, with the 4-period average (P11-P14) being approximately 431 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~300. Demand remains volatile (ranging from 304 to 564 in recent weeks). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 72 units on-hand and high seasonal demand expected to persist through May and June, we need to maintain high inventory levels. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand seasonal regime, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) at this elevated level. The pipeline (1896 units) is substantial, so the backend policy will cap orders appropriately to avoid overstocking while covering the demand surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1336.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a sustained seasonal demand peak for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt), coinciding with late May. Demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) has averaged 433 units, significantly higher than the early-season average of ~300. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Starting on-hand inventory is 0, indicating current stockouts and a high need for aggressive replenishment. The backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat, where the z-score for this profit/holding ratio (4:1, q=0.80) is approximately 0.84. To capture the full demand of the review + lead time window (1+4=5 periods) under this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering P11-P15) to reflect the current mean of ~433. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent high volatility (stdev ~93 during this surge). The OR backend's capping logic will help moderate the order size relative to the pipeline, but given the stockouts, a high base stock target is necessary to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Late spring/early summer demand regime confirmed (P11-P15 average = 433 units/period), with high volatility (stdev = 93). Lead time consistent at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early June (2019/6/03), which is a peak season for 'Everyday Basics' Jersey T-shirts. Period 16 concludes with a demand of 435 units, which is consistent with the established late spring/early summer regime. The 5-period average (P12-P16) is approximately 407 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P12 arrival in P16), meaning the backend OR formula needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal average (~407 * 5 = 2035) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this peak season (stdev ~58). This ensures we maintain a high service level to capture sales while acknowledging that on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 209 units, though several periods of stockouts in the recent history (P11-P12, P15) demand a robust base stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, entering the peak summer season for women's jersey T-shirts. Demand remains elevated and volatile, with Period 17 reaching a new peak of 640 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 462.8 units with a standard deviation of 113.8. To ensure high service levels during this seasonal peak and account for the 4-period lead time + current period (L+1=5), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this increased summer mean, and the 'default' method for L (4 periods). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to capture recent high volatility. This strategy targets a high enough base stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 9-12 and 15 while managing the holding costs of the lightweight jersey product.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: P11-P17 average demand is 463 units (+50% vs spring baseline); P17 reached 640 units (all-time high).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the peak summer demand regime for a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt'. Historically, demand has surged from a baseline of ~300 to an average of ~458 units/period over the last 8 weeks (P11-P18). The most recent demand was 419, following an all-time high of 640 in P17. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 140 and in-transit at 1589, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5). Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 (the summer regime length) captures the recent high-volume trend (average ~458). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~98) observed during this peak season. This ensures sufficient stock to handle summer spikes while the OR engine manages the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) via the service level calculation.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in the middle of its peak summer season (late June). Demand has stabilized at a high level. Calculating the average demand from the identified summer regime shift starting Period 11 (P11-P19), the mean is 444 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 101. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show a mean of 499, driven by an all-time high of 640 in P17, though P18-P19 settled back towards 430s. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the high volatility observed in this seasonal peak, I am using recent_N (N=9, covering the summer regime P11-P19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the sustained higher volume (avg 444) and the significant variability (stdev ~101) to protect against stockouts during this critical period while on-hand inventory is currently low (87).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P11-P19) continues with a mean of 444 units/period, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~305.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is July 1st. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the summer season. Looking at the history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 11 (late April), rising from a baseline of ~305 to roughly 440-460 units per period. The last 10 periods (P11-P20) show an average demand of 426.9, while the last 5 periods (P16-P20) show 446.8. The demand in Period 20 (301) was lower, but given the July 1st date, this is likely temporary volatility rather than a trend reversal. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the summer regime while smoothing out recent noise. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals from P5 to P20). Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to reflect the increased volatility (std dev ~100) observed during this high-demand summer period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak continues (July 1st); 10-period average (P11-P20) is 426.9 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~305.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8th). The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer demand season. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-10 averaged ~305 units/period, whereas Period 11-21 has averaged ~409 units/period. Though the last two periods (P20-P21) saw a decline to 301 and 232 units, this likely represents high seasonal volatility rather than a return to spring baselines, especially given the upcoming high summer weeks. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 115 and a heavy pipeline of 2045 units (largely from aggressive orders in P17-P20), we need to maintain a high enough base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand while acknowledging the current high inventory position. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the summer regime (P11-P21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend uses the higher seasonal mean (~409) rather than the all-time mean.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a jersey t-shirt, currently in mid-July. Examining the recent demand history, there is a clear downward trend from the late June peak. Demand in Period 17 was 640; it has since decreased to 419 (P18), 439 (P19), 301 (P20), 232 (P21), and 238 (P22). This indicates the 'Summer Peak' (regime averaging ~444) has transitioned into a 'Late Summer/Mid-July' regime with significantly lower demand. The average of the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is approximately 257 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is high (1566 units), including large orders from P19 (625) and P20 (541) that will arrive soon. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient sigma_hat to cover potential volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand has decreased from the summer peak (~444) to a lower July regime averaging 257 units/period over the last 3 periods (P20-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (P24). Analysis of the last 4 periods (P20-P23) shows a significant demand drop from the summer peak (~444 units) to a new regime averaging 245.75 units (301, 232, 238, 212). This decline aligns with the natural lifecycle of a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' as the height of the summer season passes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P21, P22, P23). Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 932), resulting from orders placed during the summer peak arriving just as demand declined. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture this downward shift and prevent over-ordering while carrying high stock. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility in this new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July demand (P20-P23) has dropped to an average of ~246 units/period, down from the June peak of ~444 (-45%). High on-hand inventory (932) will serve demand for several periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1) T-shirt' has entered a lower-demand phase following the June summer peak. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has averaged 238 units, significantly down from the ~444 units seen in the previous regime. We are currently in late July, moving towards the end of the summer season. Inventory levels are exceptionally high (On-hand: 1266) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now (P20 arrival of 541 units, with P21-P22 orders of 237 and 163 units still in transit). With over 5 periods of supply on hand based on the current 238-unit average, the priority is to avoid further holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this lower July demand regime and sigma_hat similarly to capture the current reduced volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' T-shirts has significantly declined from its summer peak (avg ~444) to a late-summer/early-fall regime. Over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), demand shifted down to an average of ~207 units/period, with the most recent observation dropping further to 154 units. As we are entering August, this downward trend is consistent with a shift away from peak summer jersey basics. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory of 1,349 units is extremely high, covering approximately 6-8 periods of current demand without even considering the 163 units in transit. To avoid excessive holding costs, I am continuing to set orders to zero by maintaining parameters that reflect the current lower demand and high stock level. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower post-peak demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand decreased from summer peak (~444) to a late-summer regime averaging ~207 units/period (P20-P25). High stock levels currently exceed projected demand for the next 4-6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1002.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey' continues its sharp decline as summer passes into mid-August (Current Date: 2019/08/12). Recent demands have dropped significantly: 232, 238, 212, 207, 154, and 102 over the last 6 periods. The 4-period mean is now approximately 169 units. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1410 units with zero units in transit. Given the current demand trajectory, the on-hand stock covers over 8 periods of demand, which is well beyond the (L+1=5) period planning horizon. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 4-period average (N=4) to accurately model the downward trend, and lead time remains calculated at 4 periods based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: late-summer demand (P23-P26) has further decelerated to an average of ~169 units/period, down from the July average of ~246. Inventory remains in significant surplus.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a late-summer/pre-fall decline. Recent demand (P23-P27) has dropped significantly to an average of 139 units per period (212, 207, 154, 102, 120), which is roughly 31% of the June peak (~444). With on-hand inventory currently at 1290 units and no units in transit, the current stock covers approximately 9 periods of demand at the recent average. Order activity was paused starting Period 23 to prevent excessive holding costs as demand cooled. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P23-P27) to capture this new, lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will likely continue to recommend zero ordering (final order = 0) because current pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the calculated base stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime shift confirmed (P23-P27): demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~139 units/period, down from the June peak of ~444. Inventory levels are high, requiring zero ordering for the immediate future to minimize holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a late-August period (2019/8/26) for 'Tilly (1)', a T-shirt. Historical data confirms a significant seasonal downturn following the June/early-July peak. Over the last six periods (P23-P28), demand has averaged approximately 150 units per period (212, 207, 154, 102, 120, 158), which is a sharp decline from the peak average of ~444. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1132 units, while the projected demand for the next lead time plus review period (5 periods) is roughly 750 units (assuming current mean). There is no in-transit inventory as ordering was stopped in Period 23 to digest surplus stock. Maintaining zero orders is necessary to reduce significant holding costs ($1/unit/period) until inventory levels align with the current lower demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this lower demand mean (~150) and volatility (stdev ~40) for the OR backend calculation, though the high on-hand volume will correctly result in a zero-order output.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has entered a low-volume late-summer/early-autumn regime. The last five periods (P25-P29) show an average demand of 134.8 units/period, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~444. On-hand inventory is currently 992 units, which, at the recent demand rate, covers over 7 periods of demand (well beyond the 4-period lead time + 1 review period). To maximize total reward and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period), I must continue to avoid ordering until on-hand inventory levels are better aligned with the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the decelerated demand since Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn demand stabilization confirmed (P25-P29): average demand is ~135 units/period, significantly lower than the June peak. Current inventory levels remain excessive for the detected regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which typically experiences lower demand as the summer peak ends. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), the mean demand is 154 units per period (std \u2248 42). In the very last 5 periods (P26-P30), the mean is even lower at 133 units. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 847 units with zero in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (total 5 periods), the expected demand over the relevant window is approximately 665 units (133 * 5). Our on-hand inventory of 847 units easily covers this requirement. To minimize significant holding costs ($1/unit/period), I will continue to order nothing. I use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the stabilized lower-demand regime while providing enough sample size for volatility estimation. The L parameter remains at 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4.

The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) is 137 units/period with relatively low volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 706 units, which at the current depletion rate of ~137 units/period, provides approximately 5.15 periods of stock. Since the lead time is 4 periods, this inventory level is sufficient to cover demand through the lead time of any order placed now, plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, no new orders are required to avoid stockouts, and maintaining a 'zero order' strategy is optimal to minimize further holding costs, which are high at $1.0/unit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this stable low-demand period, allowing the OR backend's base-stock calculation to reflect the reduced requirements. The pipeline is currently empty, and on-hand inventory 706 is greater than the projected base stock (approx 5 * 137), so the capped policy will correctly result in a zero order.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has stabilized in a late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has averaged 140 units/period (120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135) with low volatility (std \u2248 12). Current on-hand inventory is 571 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at this rate. With a lead time of 4 periods, we are approaching the point where new orders are needed to prevent a stockout in Period 37/38. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), it is optimal to continue depleting the current surplus to minimize holding costs. The OR backend uses a target service level base stock; the current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) of 588 units still significantly exceeds the projected base stock for the current regime (~140 * 5 = 700 units, but capped by the logic). I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the stable autumn regime and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed (P27-P32): average demand has stabilized at ~140 units/period, showing significantly lower volume and volatility compared to the summer peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' has stabilized into an autumn regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is 144 units, contrasting with the much higher summer peak (average ~444). On-hand inventory is 424 units, and in-transit inventory is 148 units (orders from P32 and P33). The total pipeline plus on-hand (572) is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (144 * 4 = 576). Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are approaching the point where new orders are needed to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 periods (5 periods). Using a 7-period window for mu_hat (N=7) captures the recent stable autumn trend while filtering out the prior summer volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in an autumn demand regime for basic t-shirts. Demand has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) at an average of approximately 131.9 units per period, showing lower volume and less volatility compared to the summer peak. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 318 units, with 303 units in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34). Total pipeline plus on-hand is 621 units. With an estimated demand of ~132/period, the current total coverage is roughly 4.7 periods. Since promised lead time is 4 periods, we are approaching the point where new orders are required to maintain a buffer. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this stable autumn baseline. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will compute the order based on a base-stock target for (L+1) periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, mid-autumn. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 122.8 units per period, showing a slight downward trend compared to the previous autumn average (~140). On-hand inventory is 233 units, with 396 units in-transit (ordered in P32-P35: 17, 131, 155, 93). Given the lead time of 4 periods, the P32 order (17 units) is expected to arrive in P36. The total units available to cover the lead time (P36-P40) is 629 (on-hand 233 + in-transit 396), which covers approximately 5.1 periods of the current demand regime (at ~123/period). To maintain a safety buffer while minimizing holding costs in a low-demand phase, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and variance to reflect the most recent deceleration observed in October. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn demand deceleration observed (P31-P35): average demand dropped to ~123 units/period, down from the early autumn baseline of ~140 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 37 (Oct 21). The product is a basic T-shirt entering late autumn. The carry-over insights and recent history show a clear downward trend in demand since the summer peak. The most recent regime (P31-P36) shows demand has dropped to an average of ~116 units/period, with the last two periods dropping further (85, 84). I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower autumn/late-autumn demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P32 order arriving in P36). Inventory levels are finally stabilizing; with 166 on-hand and 414 in-transit (ordered P33-P36), the pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of the current demand regime. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (~116 * 5 = 580) and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the reduced volatility as demand softens into the colder months.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Late autumn demand deceleration confirmed (P31-P36); average demand has dropped to 116 units/period, down from the early autumn average of 140.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a lightweight T-shirt, which is experiencing a seasonal decline as we move into late autumn (late October). Demand has significantly slowed from the summer peak (~444 units) to a current late-autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P31-P37), demand averaged 102 units/period. The most recent 3 periods (P35-P37) show an even lower average of ~93 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P32 and P33 arrivals). On-hand inventory is 188, with 339 units in-transit (orders from P34-P37). Total pipeline (188 + 339 = 527) is sufficient to cover approximately 5.6 periods of demand at the current average of 93 units/period. Since the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods, and we want to minimize holding costs for this basic jersey item during its off-season, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the deceleration while maintaining a buffer against volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Tilly (1)' (T-shirt) has settled into a late autumn/early winter regime. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the average daily demand is approximately 92.4 units, confirming a significant drop from the early autumn levels (~140). The current date is Nov 4, approaching the year-end (Period 47). Current total inventory (On-hand: 265 + In-transit: 283 = 548) is sufficient for roughly 6 periods of demand at the current rate. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must maintain orders to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this decelerating trend more accurately while mitigating the noise of the recent very low demand (78) in Period 38.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn demand stabilization: P34-P38 average demand is ~92 units/period, down from the early autumn baseline of ~140. Transition to winter regime likely until the game end at P47.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (November 11th). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in a seasonally low demand phase as we approach winter (game ends at P47). Demand has stabilized at a late autumn/winter regime; the last 5 periods (P35-P39) show an average demand of approximately 83.4 units/period, significantly lower than the early autumn baseline (~140). Forecast for the remaining 8 periods should reflect this lower mean. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 297 units and in-transit is 247 units (from orders in P36-P39), totaling 544 units. At the current demand rate of ~83 units/period, this total inventory covers approximately 6.5 periods. While this is sufficient to prevent immediate stockouts, we need to maintain a small pipeline to cover the final periods of the game without excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the most recent winter deceleration.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed (P35-P39): average demand has dropped to ~83 units/period, reflecting seasonal lows for lightweight jersey products in November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), approaching the game end at Period 47. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is experiencing seasonal lows. The current winter demand regime (P35-P40) shows an average demand of approximately 74.5 units per period (85, 84, 109, 78, 61, 69). On-hand inventory is 263 units, and 212 units are in-transit (expected arrivals: 56 in P41, 99 in P42, 57 in P43). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 475 units. At the current demand rate of ~75 units, we have coverage for approximately 6.3 periods, which extends to the end of the game (P47). Ordering more now would only increase holding costs without providing additional sales benefit, especially given the lead time of 4 periods. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 6 to capture the winter low, and since inventory levels are already sufficient for the remainder of the game, the capped policy will naturally result in zero or minimal orders.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-P40) average stabilized at ~75 units/period, reflecting seasonal lows for lightweight jersey products in late Q4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25th (Period 42). Demand for this T-shirt SKU has reached its seasonal low, with a 7-period average (P35-P41) of approximately 76 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 252 units, and there are 156 units in-transit (99 ordered P38, 57 ordered P39), bringing the total pipeline + on-hand inventory to 408 units. Given the game ends at Period 47, we have 6 periods of demand left (P42-P47). At the current rate of 76 units/period, total remaining demand is roughly 456 units. With 408 units already available or arriving, we are nearly covered for the rest of the game. Additional ordering should be minimal to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit/period) near the end-of-life of this seasonal SKU. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the winter low and sigma_hat similarly to reflect reduced volatility, while keeping L at default (4). The backend capped policy will manage the limited ordering needed.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 of 47. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its off-peak winter season. The demand regime over the last 8 periods (P35-P42) has stabilized at a mean of ~78 units/period, significantly lower than earlier seasons. There is a slight uptick in P42 (109), but given the remaining time (only 5 periods including current), we must prioritize minimizing holding costs for the end-of-game transition. On-hand inventory is 242 and in-transit is 75 (57 from P39 + 18 from P42). The total inventory (317) is sufficient to cover the remaining demand (5 periods * ~80-100 units/period = 400-500 total demand). However, with 242 on-hand and an arrival of 57 expected next period (P44), we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent winter average (N=8) and use calculation for lead time (stable at 4). No further large orders are needed to avoid excessive ending inventory and associated holding costs as the game concludes in P47.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P35-P42) consistently averages ~78 units/period, reflecting seasonal lows for lightweight jersey products in Q4. Game ending in Period 47; shift focus to target zero ending inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of 47. The product is a lightweight T-shirt in December, currently in a stable winter low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 9 periods (P35-P43) is approximately 78 units/period. Total inventory currently available to satisfy demand until the game end is 369 units (238 on-hand + 131 in-transit). With 4 periods remaining (P44, P45, P46, P47) and an expected total demand of ~312 units (78 * 4), my existing stock is sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Any further orders placed now (arriving in Period 48, after the game ends) would only incur holding costs and contribute to dead stock. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure zero additional ordering is triggered by the OR backend. I am using 'explicit' L=4 to match confirmed lead time and 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current winter regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal low (winter regime). Average demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 78 units. With the game ending in Period 47, any order placed now (L=4) would arrive in Period 49, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering more stock is counterproductive as it would only increase holding costs without any opportunity for sales. Currently, on-hand inventory is 183 units. Expected demand for the remaining periods (P45, P46, P47) is approximately 78 * 3 = 234 units. While on-hand inventory (183) is slightly below this projection, the in-transit inventory of 199 is ample (with 18 units from P42 arriving in P46 and 113 units from P43 arriving in P47). My priority is to maximize profit by avoiding unnecessary holding costs and ending the simulation with inventory as close to zero as possible. I will set the parameters to ensure the OR backend places a zero order by using a low mu_hat and an explicit lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47. The game ends after Period 47's demand resolution. Current inventory consists of 119 units on-hand and 243 units in-transit. The in-transit units were ordered in Periods 42 (18 units), 43 (113 units), 44 (68 units), and 45 (44 units). Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, none of the orders placed in Periods 43-45 will arrive before the game ends. The order from Period 42 (18 units) should arrive in Period 46 (Resolution Phase). Therefore, total available inventory for the remaining two periods (P46 and P47) is approximately 119 (on-hand) + 18 (expected arrival) = 137 units. The current winter demand regime (P35-P45) is averaging ~77 units/period. Total expected demand for P46 and P47 is ~154 units. With ~137 units available, we are nearly perfectly stocked to minimize ending inventory without significant stockout risk. Since any order placed now (Period 46) would arrive in Period 50, well after the game concludes, the order quantity must be zero. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 periods (P35-P45) reflecting the winter baseline of ~77 units to ensure the OR logic correctly assesses the surplus.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period of the game. My objective is to minimize ending inventory to avoid terminal holding costs while satisfying the demand for this final period. Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. The winter demand regime (P35-P46) has an average demand of ~76 units, though the most recent period (P46) spiked to 92. Since any order placed today will not arrive until Period 51 (L=4), and the game ends today, ordering is futile. There are 281 units in-transit, but these will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' to reflect the current winter low-demand regime, though the resulting 'final order' will effectively be capped or unnecessary given the timeline. I am prioritizing liquidating the remaining on-hand stock.
