Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt). Current inventory is zero. Historical demand shows an upward trend over the last 5 samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], suggesting a recent demand regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. The mean of the last 3 samples (approx 233) is significantly higher than the all-time mean (approx 204). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this upward momentum and ensure the 'mu_hat' reflects the current demand level. For 'sigma_hat', I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent periods. The promised lead time is 2, and since we have no historical arrival data yet to suggest otherwise, I will use the 'default' lead time method. This configuration aims to prevent stockouts during the initial ordering phase by weighting the recent high-demand observations more heavily.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The SKU 610776002 is a women's t-shirt. The promised lead time is 2. In Period 1, we ordered 356 units. Based on the rules, since the lead time is 2, we should not see arrivals until Period 3's conclusion (readable at Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we lost 266 units of demand in Period 1 due to zero stock. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266]. The last three periods (233, 308, 266) average 269, compared to the earlier average of ~160. This suggests a demand regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this higher mean for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the higher volatility in this new regime. Lead time L is set to default (2). Parameters ensure (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last 7 periods: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266, 316]. The average of the first 4 samples was ~179, whereas the last 3 samples average ~297, indicating a clear regime shift towards higher demand. In Period 2, we observed an actual lead time of 1 period (order from P1 arrived in P2), which is faster than the promised 2 periods. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~297/period). Since the actual lead time was 1, but the promised is 2, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead time, which should lean towards 1-2 periods and adjust the pipeline requirements accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean increased from ~180 to ~300 over the last 3 periods. Actual lead time observed at 1 period for P1 order.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 586 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P3). Historical demand has undergone a significant regime shift: early samples averaged ~180, while the last three periods (P1-P3) averaged 296 (266, 316, 306). The P1 order arrived in P2, indicating an actual lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2. However, the P2 order (331 units) did not arrive in P3, meaning lead time is at least 2 for that shipment. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent 300-level demand trend. L is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the observed lead time data. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean increased from ~180 to ~296 (+64%) over periods P1-P3. Actual lead time varies between 1 and 2+ periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift: early samples (seed data) averaged 184, but the last 5 periods (including those from the game history) show [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266, 316, 306, 283]. The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 293, confirming the shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 614 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). While the P1 order arrived in 1 period, the P2 order (331 units) is now overdue (promised lead time 2, currently at P5 start). This suggests lead time variability or potential loss. Since the product is a basic item and we are in mid-March, steady demand is expected. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the default promised value of 2 while the OR backend accounts for the large pipeline inventory (614) to prevent over-ordering if the overdue P2 shipment eventually arrives.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Mean stabilized at ~293 units/period over the last 4 periods (P1-P4). Shipment from P2 (ordered 2019/2/18) is currently 1 period overdue relative to promised lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is exhibiting a sustained demand regime shift. Historical data (P1-P5) shows a mean demand of approximately 285 units, significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg 185). Recent periods (P4-P5) show a slight cooling to ~267, but the overall level remains high. Lead time (L) is unstable: P1 arrived in 1 period, while P2 took 3 periods. P3 (ordered 2019/2/25) is now 1 period overdue relative to the promised L=2, and P4 is reaching its promised arrival window. Currently, on-hand inventory is 79 with 581 units in-transit (P3, P4, P5). Given the volatility in lead times (1 to 3+ periods) and the risk of lost or significantly delayed shipments (P3), I am setting L=3 to account for the observed maximum lead time. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=5 to capture the new demand level (avg ~285) over the review period + lead time (1+3=4 periods). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the higher volatility observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Observed range 1 to 3 periods; Period 3 order (2019/2/25) is now 1 period overdue (currently 3 periods in transit). Demand regime remains stable at ~285 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, a basic staple. Historical demand (recent 5 periods) is approximately 285 units/period [316, 306, 283, 252, 270]. Current Period 7 (late March) is entering the Spring season, which typically supports steady or rising demand for lightweight jersey tops. A major concern is lead-time volatility: we have observed lead times of 1, 3, and 2 periods. Critically, the order from Period 3 (255 units ordered Feb 25) has not arrived as of the Period 6 conclusion (March 18), making it 3 periods overdue and potentially lost or significantly delayed. The order from Period 5 (298 units) and Period 6 (329 units) are still within the promised lead-time window. Total in-transit is 882 units (P3: 255, P5: 298, P6: 329). Given the stockout in Period 6 (on-hand 0), I will use 'explicit' lead time of 3 to account for the observed delays and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon (L+1=4 periods). For mu_hat, I'll use the recent demand mean of ~285 across 4 periods (1140 total). For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 3 order (255 units) is potentially lost: 4 periods since ordering with no arrival. Actual lead time mean is shifting towards 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1. The SKU is a women's basic T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the pre-game history, with the last 7 periods averaging ~295 units. Specifically, Period 7 saw a spike to 364 units, likely due to early spring seasonality. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) due to a suspected lost shipment from Period 3 (ordered 255 units, 4 periods ago) and the delay of the Period 5 order. The order from Period 5 (298 units) is currently at the promised lead time of 2 periods and is expected to arrive during Period 8. Lead times are volatile: observed values are 1, 3, and 2 periods. Given the high stockout risk and the missing P3 order, I will set L=3 to account for the observed volatility and ensure the OR backend targets a larger pipeline. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=7 to capture the current stable demand regime (~295/unit) across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 3 order (255 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost; pipeline inventory is effectively inflated by these units. Seasonal spring demand increase observed (P7 demand 364 vs 295 average).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, entering the spring season for the 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~285 units in the first six periods to ~368 units in the most recent two periods (P7-P8), representing a ~29% increase likely driven by seasonal warming. Lead times are volatile: P1=1, P2=3, P4=2, P5=3, P6=2. Critically, the P3 order (255 units) placed on 2019/2/25 has not arrived after 6 periods and is considered lost. The OR backend's pipeline inventory includes these 255 'ghost' units, which will lead it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect (L+1) * 368 units (3 * 368 = 1104), but I will inflate this to 1359 (1104 + 255) to 'neutralize' the lost units in the pipeline calculation. L is set to 2 (promised), as most recent arrivals (P4, P5, P6) average 2.33 periods, and the OR cap logic is sensitive to L.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand shift confirmed at P7: Mean demand increased from ~285 to ~368 (+29%). Order from Period 3 (255 units) is confirmed lost after 6 periods of no arrival; parameters adjusted to offset this in pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is subject to spring/summer seasonality. Demand shows a significant shift starting Period 7 (averaging ~335 units over the last 3 periods vs ~285 previously). The Period 3 order (255 units) is now 7 periods old and is officially considered lost; it is removed from effective pipeline logic. Actual lead times observed are 1, 3, 2, 3, and 2 periods (Average ~2.2). However, recent volatility and the lost shipment suggest setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a wider window (L+1=4 periods) to prevent stockouts during demand spikes. mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the higher spring demand regime (~335 units/period * 4 periods = 1340). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand regime sustained: Period 7-9 average demand is 335.6 units (+18% vs previous baseline). Lead time remains volatile (range 1-3 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, and we are currently in late April (Period 11), entering the peak spring/summer season. Demand has shifted upwards since Period 7, with a recent 4-period average (P7-P10) of 329.25 units. The Period 3 order (255 units) is now 8 periods old and officially considered lost; because the backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (1440 units) from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target, effectively offsetting those lost units so the order quantity isn't suppressed. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.2. Setting L to 2 (promised) is sufficient if mu_hat is adjusted. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 329 + 255 = 1242 to account for 3 periods of demand plus the lost unit gap. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the spring demand regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's T-shirt, seeing a seasonal peak in demand as we approach late April/May. Period 11 saw a significant demand spike to 564 units, likely driven by spring seasonality. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 376 units, significantly higher than the early baseline of ~285. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.2). Order P3 (255 units) is confirmed lost, while orders P7 (302 units) and P10 (282 units) are still in transit; P7 is now 5 periods old and highly suspect, but P10 is within the volatile window. Current on-hand inventory is low (37), while pipeline inventory is high (839), though 557 units (P3+P7) are likely lost. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the spring demand level (376 units/period) and 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the current lead time stretching and protect against stockouts during this high-demand phase. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand peak confirmed: P7-P11 average demand is 376 units (+32% vs previous regime). Order from P7 (302 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, joining the lost P3 order.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, and we are currently in May (Period 13), entering the peak summer season. Demand has significantly increased, with the average demand from Periods 7-12 being approximately 384 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~285. Recent demand in Period 11 (564) and Period 12 (424) indicates high volatility and growth. The lead time remains unstable, averaging 2.3 periods for successful arrivals. Crucially, two orders are likely lost: Period 3 (255 units) and Period 7 (302 units), totaling 557 units. These units are still counted in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' but will never arrive. To compensate and ensure the backend places an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on L=2 (3 periods of coverage: current + 2 lead time). Target = 384 * 3 = 1152. To offset the 557 lost units, I must add them to the mu_hat value so that (mu_hat - pipeline) results in the correct order quantity. mu_hat = 1152 + 557 = 1709. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the spring/summer surge.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: P3 (255 units) and P7 (302 units) have not arrived after 10 and 6 periods respectively. Pipeline inventory is inflated by 557 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13), we are managing a women's T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which is currently in its spring/summer peak. Demand is volatile but elevated, with a recent 5-period average of 376 units (P7-P11) and a slight dip in P13 (304 units). The critical issue is pipeline management. We have 1832 units in-transit, but this includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 3 (255 units) and Period 7 (302 units), totaling 557 units that will never arrive. The OR backend's capped policy (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) will under-order if it believes the pipeline is full of valid units. To fix this, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock to compensate for the 557 phantom units. Based on a target service level and a forecast mean of ~380, the expected base stock for L=2 should be around (380 * 3) + safety stock. By setting mu_hat = 1700, I ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (range 1-3 periods). Sigma_hat uses the recent_N (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen during the spring demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: 557 units from P3 and P7 are permanently lost. Parameters must be adjusted to bypass the pipeline inventory cap in the OR backend.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20 (Spring/Summer transition). The product is a T-shirt, which is in peak seasonal demand. Recent demand (P11-P14) has averaged 431 units, significantly higher than the early-year baseline. The primary operational issue is pipeline inventory inflation: orders from P3 (255 units) and P7 (302 units) are confirmed lost (6+ periods overdue), totaling 557 units that the OR backend mistakenly believes are coming. This causes the order cap (min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) to trigger, resulting in zero or insufficient orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To force the OR backend to order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to offset the 557 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' with a value of 1850. This represents (L+1) * 431 (approx 1293) plus the 557 lost units, ensuring the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation yields a positive order. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to reflect high seasonal volatility and provide a safety buffer. L is set to 2 (default) as most recent successful arrivals (P10, P11, P12) show lead times of 2-3 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 16 (2019/5/27). Demand for this T-shirt SKU has entered a high-demand spring/early summer regime. The average demand from Period 11 to 15 is approximately 433 units/period. The lead time remains volatile, typically between 2 and 3 periods. Crucially, orders from Period 3 (255 units) and Period 7 (302 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 557 units. These units still appear in the backend's 'In-transit' figure (1306 total), but will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (In-transit - Lost Units + On-hand). Pipeline (1306) - Lost (557) + On-hand (271) = 1020 units actually available or coming. With a lead time of 2, the backend covers (L+1)=3 periods. 3 periods * 433 units = 1299. However, because the backend uses the full 1306 in its calculation, I must use 'explicit' to force a mu_hat that triggers replenishment. I set mu_hat to 1800 (representing roughly 4 periods of demand + lost unit buffer) to maintain availability during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 557 lost units (P3 and P7). Parameters must be set using 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's order cap until these units are purged or the system resets.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/03. Analysis of recent demand (P12-P16) shows a sustained high-demand regime with an average of approximately 427 units/period, coinciding with the spring/summer seasonal peak for women's jersey t-shirts. Pipeline inventory is currently 1452 units, but this includes 557 units from lost shipments (P3: 255 units, P7: 302 units) which will never arrive. The OR backend's order cap logic 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' will prevent necessary ordering because it views the 557 lost units as incoming stock. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the (L+1) demand window (3 periods), I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for this 557-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Stock for 3 periods = 3 * 427 = 1281 units. Effective Pipeline = 1452 - 557 = 895. Required Order = 1281 - 895 - 23 (on-hand) = 363. To force the OR backend to order ~363 units when it thinks the pipeline is 1452, I set mu_hat (which is the base stock) to approximately 1838 (1281 + 557 + safety buffer). This 'explicit' override bypasses the pipeline inflation issue.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal plateau confirmed: P12-P16 average demand is 427 units, significantly higher than the spring average of 376. Pipeline correction of +557 units remains necessary for all mu_hat calculations.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer seasonal peak, with demand in Period 17 reaching 640 units and an average over the last four periods (P14-P17) of 487 units. Pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 557 units due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 3 (255 units) and Period 7 (302 units). Since the backend OR logic subtracts the full pipeline (including lost units) from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method to override the mu_hat parameter. I am setting mu_hat to 2018, calculated as: ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Lost Units = (3 * 487) + 557 = 2018. This ensures the order quantity isn't suppressed by the 'ghost' inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility during this seasonal shift.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, currently in the peak summer demand phase (June). The most recent demand (P17: 640, P18: 419) confirms a higher plateau compared to the spring regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 474.2 units. The 'In-transit' count of 2167 units is heavily inflated by 557 units from lost shipments (P3 and P7) which never arrived and are now over 10 periods old. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Following the logic that base_stock = (1+L) * mu_hat, and the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from this, I set mu_hat such that (1+L) * mu_hat covers the desired safety stock plus the 557-unit pipeline deficit. With an expected lead time of 2 (so 1+L=3), and a forecast of ~475 units/period, the 'real' base stock should be ~1425. Adding the 557 lost units to bypass the cap, I set mu_hat to (1425 + 557) / 3 = 660. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand confirmed: P14-P18 average demand is 474 units (+25% vs spring). Pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 557 units (P3: 255, P7: 302).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, and we are currently in late June (Period 20), the peak of the summer season. Historical demand for the most recent regime (P14-P19) shows an average demand of 474 units per period, with a peak of 640 units in P17. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (1834 units) is significantly inflated by two confirmed lost shipments: P3 (255 units) and P7 (302 units), totaling 557 phantom units. Because the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)), these lost units prevent necessary orders from being placed. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1 review period) at a demand rate of 480: (3 * 480) = 1440. To counteract the 557 unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 1440 + 557 = 1997. This ensures the OR engine calculates a high enough base stock to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P16 at LT=3, P15 at LT=1) average out to approximately the promised 2 periods, though volatility is noted.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained: P14-P19 average demand is 468 units. Pipeline inflation of 557 units (lost P3 and P7) continues to require explicit mu_hat adjustments to prevent stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/07/01. Context: We are in the peak summer demand season for a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand remains high but volatile. Crucially, 557 units from Period 3 (255 units) and Period 7 (302 units) are confirmed lost, but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 2098. The OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory) will severely under-order because it believes these 557 units are arriving. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter by the volume of lost stock. Recent demand (P14-P20) averages ~409 units/period, but earlier summer peaks were higher (~470). Given the lead time L=2, the total window is (1+L)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~1350 units. To bypass the 557 unit pipeline 'ghost', I set mu_hat to 1350 + 557 = 1907. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this correction. For L and sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current seasonal volatility and actual lead time behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in summer peak; P14-P20 average demand is 409 units/period. The pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 557 lost units (P3 and P7), necessitating an explicit mu_hat offset of +557 units to prevent stockouts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: July 8th (Summer). Demand is coming off a high peak (P17-P19) and showing signs of normalization or a slight mid-summer dip (P20-P21), with a recent 5-period average of 406 units. Pipeline inventory (1828 units) is still critically inflated by 557 permanently lost units from Period 3 (255 units) and Period 7 (302 units). Since the OR backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it will under-order by exactly 557 units every period unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset this phantom inventory. I am setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the necessary +557 unit offset. The base forecast for mu_hat is (1+L) * 406 = 1218, plus the 557 offset, totaling 1775. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in the early summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand dip at P20-P21: Mean demand decreased from ~470 to ~266. Pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 557 lost units (P3: 255, P7: 302), requiring a continuous explicit mu_hat offset.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt. Current date is mid-July (Period 23), following a peak summer demand period. Demand has significantly cooled down in the last three periods (P20-P22: 301, 232, 238), dropping from the previous peak of ~470 to an average of ~257 units/period. The pipeline inventory (1965 units) is heavily inflated by 557 permanently lost units from Period 3 (255) and Period 7 (302). Additionally, several recent orders (P12: 562, P17: 445, P20: 264) have not arrived yet. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the phantom 557 units in the pipeline, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to (L+1) * forecasted_demand + lost_units = (2+1)*250 + 557 = 1307. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility during the demand drop. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as recent actual arrivals (P16 and P18) arrived within 3 periods, suggesting no further drastic delays beyond the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Summer peak ended; average demand decreased from ~470 to ~257 units/period (-45%).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward from the summer peak (avg ~470) to a lower post-peak level (avg ~246 units/period over P20-P23). Current on-hand is 0, and the system reports 1,965 units in transit. Analyzing the history shows that orders from P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and likely P20 (264) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 1,828 units of 'ghost inventory' that inflate the pipeline. Only the order from P22 (137 units) is likely to arrive. To bypass the backend's capped order logic which subtracts the full pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 1,828 lost units. Target base stock = 3 * 246 (738) + 1,828 = 2,566. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P18) showed 3, but the primary constraint is the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: Mean decreased from ~470 to ~246 (-48%). Pipeline inventory is now inflated by 1,828 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) which are effectively lost. Parameter mu_hat must include an offset of +1,828 to force orders through the backend cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 20 is now well-established, with the last five periods (P20-P24) averaging 218 units, a significant decrease from the summer peak of ~470 units. The pipeline inventory is severely inflated by five likely lost shipments: P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and P20 (264), totaling 1,828 'ghost' units. To bypass the OR backend's order cap and ensure arrivals during this lower demand period, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method with a value that includes the forecast for the review + lead time (3 periods * 218 = 654) plus an offset to neutralize the lost units (1,828), totaling 2,482. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the recent lower-demand regime (N=5) to reflect the reduced volatility. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historical average of 2.2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: A total of 1,828 units from periods P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20 are permanently lost. Parameters must continue using 'explicit' mu_hat adjustments to bypass the backend order cap until these units are removed from the system's pipeline calculation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5), we are managing a T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P21-P25) has significantly cooled from the summer peak, averaging 189 units/period. The pipeline inventory is critically compromised: a total of 1,828 units from orders in P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and P20 (264) are confirmed as lost or severely delayed (e.g., P3 is 23 periods old). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (1,828 units) from its base stock calculation to determine the final order, and this pipeline is larger than the required stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2, R=1), the system will refuse to order any units, leading to inevitable stockouts once the current on-hand (641 units) is depleted. To prevent this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean of 189 and a lead time of 2 (target = (2+1)*189 = 567). To bypass the 1,828-unit pipeline deduction, I set mu_hat to 2,395 (567 + 1,828). This ensures the backend sees a requirement that offsets the 'phantom' inventory, maintaining a stable supply for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed at 1,828 units (Orders P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 are lost). Demand regime has shifted to a late-summer low: mean decreased to ~189 units/period over P21-P25.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has significantly declined as the summer season ends, shifting from a peak of ~470 units/period to a recent average of ~160 units/period (P22-P26: 238, 212, 207, 154, 102). The current on-hand inventory of 539 units is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 periods of this new lower demand regime. Crucially, the pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 1,828 units from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). In the OR backend, the base-stock policy subtracts this pipeline from the target level. To prevent the backend from being 'blocked' from ordering once on-hand inventory depletes, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value that incorporates a +1,828 unit offset. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of 160 units per period for (L+1) periods, where L=2, plus the 1,828 offset. This results in mu_hat = (160 * 3) + 1828 = 2308. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower volatility of the current low-demand regime. No order is expected this period due to high on-hand, but the parameters prepare the system for future replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand decline confirmed: Mean demand for P22-P26 is ~163 units/period, down from ~470 in June. Total pipeline inflation remains at 1,828 lost units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019/8/19), the demand for the women's jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a late-summer low. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is approximately 139 units, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~470. A critical issue remains: the pipeline inventory is inflated by 1,828 units from lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). In the OR backend, the capped policy is 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. Because the pipeline (1,849) is far higher than the required base stock for this low-demand regime, the backend will naturally block all new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 'ghost' units. To ensure the system can order if demand spikes or to maintain safety stock, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the lost 1,828 units to a 3-period demand forecast (L=2, so L+1=3). Recent demand mean (139) * 3 = 417. Total explicit mu_hat = 417 + 1828 = 2245. Sigma_hat is set based on the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly stabilized at a lower late-summer/autumn level. Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), average demand is approximately 148 units/period, a sharp decline from the summer peak of ~470. On-hand inventory is currently 282 units, which covers nearly 2 periods of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1,878 units is highly inflated by lost shipments from P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, and potentially P13 (713 units). These 1,828 units (plus P13's 713, totaling 2,541 lost units) will never arrive, but they prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that incorporates a massive offset. I will calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*forecast + LostUnits. Using L=2 and a forecast of 150, the base requirement is 450. Adding the confirmed lost 1,828 units results in an explicit mu_hat of 2,278. This forces the backend to see a 'requirement' that exceeds the phantom pipeline, allowing small maintenance orders if needed, though with 282 on-hand and low demand, the immediate priority is just preventing a total order freeze while demand is low.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P24-P28) confirmed: Mean demand ~148 units/period. Total pipeline inflation remains at minimum 1,828 lost units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20); P13 (713 units) is now also 15 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total phantom pipeline to 2,541 units.

The demand regime is currently in a late-summer low. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the average demand is approximately 135 units/period (154, 102, 120, 158, 140). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is consistent with a seasonal decline as autumn approaches in September. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2. The most critical issue is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, and P20 are significantly overdue (6+ periods) and must be considered lost. These units (255+302+562+713+445+264 = 2,541 units) are still counted in the 'In-transit' total of 2055 (some older ones might have cleared from the system's tracking but the backend cap still sees them). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass the backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock) + (Phantom Pipeline). Desired Base Stock for L=2 is (1+2)*135 = 405. Adding the phantom pipeline of ~2,541 units, I set mu_hat to 2,946. This forces the backend to see a high requirement and allows it to place orders despite the inflated in-transit numbers. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 2,541 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20). Late-summer demand regime (P25-P29) stabilized at ~135 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized in a late-summer low regime. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), the average demand is approximately 133 units/period. The pipeline inventory is severely distorted by lost orders. Analyzing history: P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and P20 (264) have not arrived after 10+ periods and are confirmed lost. Additionally, the P13 order (713 units) arrived in P15, but several other orders are still missing. The current 'In-transit' of 2847 units is almost entirely 'phantom' inventory consisting of these lost shipments. Because the backend OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation (capped policy), these phantom units prevent the system from placing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that includes the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus an offset equal to the lost units (~2541). This 'tricks' the backend into ordering the actual required units (approx 135 per period) despite the inflated pipeline count. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I will use the default promised L=2 for the baseline and recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 2,541 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Late-summer demand regime (P26-P30) is stable at ~133 units/period. Explicit mu_hat adjustments are mandatory to bypass backend order capping caused by lost shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basic) has stabilized at a late-summer low. For the period P27-P31, demand is [120, 158, 140, 145, 141], averaging 140.8 units/period. The current in-transit inventory is 2,973 units, but history confirms a massive 'phantom pipeline' of lost orders. Specifically, orders from P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and P20 (264) totaling 1,828 units are long overdue and confirmed lost. Additionally, the P13 order (713 units) which was previously noted as arrived in the history logs (Period 15) is now under scrutiny as part of the total pipeline inflation calculation. By comparing 'In-transit' (2973) against recent orders not yet arrived (P29: 177, P30: 792, P31: 126), we find 1,878 units are physically missing (2973 - 1095). To bypass the OR backend's order cap (which sees the 2,973 units and prevents new orders), mu_hat must be set as an explicit value incorporating the base stock needed plus the lost units. Base stock target = (L+1)*mean = 3 * 141 = 423. Total required mu_hat = 423 + 1878 = 2301 units. This forces the system to recognize that the on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is much lower than recorded.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inflation confirmed at 1,878 units due to lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Late-summer demand regime stabilized at ~141 units/period (P27-P31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observe an on-hand inventory of 834 units following the arrival of P29 and P30 orders. Demand has stabilized in a late-summer/early-autumn low, with the last 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging 143.8 units/period. The current in-transit (pipeline) inventory of 2004 units includes a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. Based on history, orders from P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and P20 (264) are definitively lost as they are all over 10 periods old. This sums to 1,828 lost units. The backend OR engine's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)] will prevent necessary ordering if this phantom inventory isn't accounted for. Therefore, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 1,828 phantom units to the forecast for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 144 = 432). This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to overcome the pipeline subtraction. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the low volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory of 1,828 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Late-summer/early-autumn demand regime (P28-P32) is stable at ~144 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized into an early-autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 141.6 units. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P29 arrived in 3, P30 arrived in 2). The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: orders from P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), and P20 (264) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 1,828 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this 1,828 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, it will not place new orders even if on-hand inventory hits zero. To bypass this cap and ensure the backend continues to order for the current demand of ~142 units/period, I am setting mu_hat to the expected (L+1) demand PLUS the 1,828 lost units. With L=2, expected demand over (2+1) periods is 426. Adding the offset: 426 + 1,828 = 2,254. This forces the backend to recognize the need for new stock despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand regime (P29-P33) stable at ~142 units/period. Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 1,828 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Explicit mu_hat adjustments including this offset are required to maintain ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable in the early-autumn phase. For periods P29-P34, the average demand is approximately 136 units/period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' inventory. Multiple historical orders (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) totaling 1,828 units have never arrived and are confirmed lost. These units are still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend OR engine. With current on-hand inventory at 581 and in-transit at 2004, the backend perceives a total stock of 2585 units. Since the required base stock for a lead time of 2 (+1 review period) at ~136 units/period is roughly 408 units plus a safety buffer, the backend will refuse to place new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset these 1,828 lost units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' with a value of 2300. This is calculated as (L+1)*demand + lost_units = 3*140 + 1828 \u2248 2248, rounded up to 2300 to ensure the cap does not block future orders if demand fluctuates. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a standard safety buffer for this regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a late-autumn decline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has dropped to 122.8 units/period, compared to the ~144 units observed in early autumn. Current on-hand inventory is 496 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of the current demand rate. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2004 units contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P17 (445), P20 (264). This totals 1,828 units of lost stock that still inflate the backend's pipeline calculation. Because 'In-transit' (2004) - 'Lost' (1828) = 176 units (likely the P31 order of 126 and some other small residual), the backend believes the system is overstocked. To ensure the OR engine can still place orders if needed, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a base stock target that accounts for this 1,828-unit inflation. Using L=2 and a forecast of 123 units/period, the real target is ~369 units. To bypass the cap, I set mu_hat to 369 + 1828 = 2197. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility during this transition to lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Mean demand decreased from ~144 to ~123 units/period. Phantom pipeline inventory remains at 1,828 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P17, P20).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly downwards since Period 34, reflecting the transition into late autumn for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. Average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 92 units/period, compared to the previous ~144 baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 412 units, which is sufficient to cover over 4 periods of the current demand rate. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 2004 units is heavily inflated by lost orders from P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, and P20 (totaling 2,541 units, though some adjustments in previous periods suggest the backend calculation might be slightly different). Specifically, P3 (255), P7 (302), P12 (562), P13 (713), P17 (445), and P20 (264) are long overdue. To prevent the OR backend from being paralyzed by this phantom inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the current (1+L) demand (approx 3 * 92 = 276) PLUS the phantom pipeline offset (2,541) to ensure the backend sees a need for stock if inventory actually runs low. Given current high on-hand levels, the backend will likely not order this period, which is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Mean demand decreased to ~92 units/period (-36% vs P28-P33). Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20) remains at 2,541 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has entered a late-autumn low, with the mean demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) stabilizing around 96 units/period. The system currently reports 2,440 units 'In-transit'. Based on the Carry-Over Insights and historical analysis, 1,828 units (from orders P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20) are confirmed lost. The remaining 612 units in transit consist of the P31 order (126 units) which is now 7 periods old and likely lost, and the P37 order (436 units). Total phantom pipeline is now estimated at 1,954 units (1,828 + 126). This phantom inventory tricks the OR backend into capping new orders. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) at a mean of 96 is approximately 288 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 2,440 phantom units, mu_hat is set to the current demand forecast (96 * 3) plus the phantom offset (1,954), totaling 2,242. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility of the demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~96 units/period (P34-P37). Total phantom pipeline inventory updated to 1,954 units as the Period 31 order (126 units) is now 7 periods overdue and presumed lost along with the previous 1,828 units.

The current on-hand inventory is 225 units. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory caused by lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, and now P31), totaling 1,954 units. These units will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend, which triggers an order cap because the system believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this and ensure the OR engine can place orders when needed, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to include a massive offset equal to the lost units. Specifically, for Period 39, the target base stock for (L+1) periods (where L=2) would be approximately 92 * 3 = 276 units. Adding the 1,954 unit phantom offset results in a mu_hat of 2,230. This ensures the calculation 'base_stock - pipeline' doesn't result in zero or a negative number. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility in this demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory updated to 1,954 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P31). Demand regime (P34-P38) stable at ~92 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 40 (2019/11/11). The demand regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has settled into a late-autumn low, with the last 5 periods (P35-P39) averaging 83.4 units/period, compared to the early-autumn average of ~144. Inventory on-hand is healthy at 600 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is 2004 units, which is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, and now P31 (ordered 9 periods ago, lead time promised is 2). These 'phantom' units total approximately 1,954 units. If mu_hat is not adjusted to exceed this phantom pipeline, the OR backend's order capping logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent any new orders from being placed when needed. Although we have sufficient stock for the next few periods, I will continue using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to maintain the necessary offset. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + phantom_offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 84) + 1954 \u2248 2206. Sigma_hat is set using the last 5 periods to reflect the current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 1,954 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P31). Late-autumn demand regime (P35-P39) is stable at ~84 units/period. Explicit mu_hat adjustments including the 1,954 unit offset are required to bypass backend order capping.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18. The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a late-autumn low, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) being approximately 80 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 531 units, which covers over 6 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 2004 units is heavily comprised of phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, and P31). Based on the carry-over insights, these lost units total 2,080 units (P3:255 + P7:302 + P12:562 + P13:713 + P17:445 + P20:264 + P31:126 = 2,667, however, P13 and P17 were large, so let's use the most recent confirmed phantom total of 1,954 and adjust for P31). Since on-hand inventory (531) is sufficient to meet demand for the next 2-3 periods (Lead Time + Review), and the system is still recovering from overstocking in P39, no new order is required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, while using the explicit mu_hat method to include the phantom inventory offset (+1,954) to ensure the OR backend doesn't block future orders once inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory remains at approximately 1,954 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P31). Demand regime (P36-P40) has slowed further to ~80 units/period as winter approaches.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand (P37-P41) has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter low of approximately 77 units per period, down from the early-autumn average of ~142. With 464 units on-hand and only 6 periods remaining in the simulation, our current inventory is more than sufficient to cover the total remaining expected demand (~460 units). Furthermore, the 'In-transit' inventory of 2004 units is entirely composed of phantom shipments from periods 3, 7, 12, 17, 20, 28, and 31 that are likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline (On-hand + In-transit = 2468) from the base stock, it will naturally result in zero orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, which correctly signals to the system that no additional stock is required, thereby minimizing further holding costs while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P37-P41) stable at ~77 units/period. Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders reached 2,004 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, P28, P31).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we are in a low-demand winter regime. Average demand for the last five periods (P38-P42) is approximately 76.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 355 units, which covers more than 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 2004 units is entirely comprised of 'phantom pipeline' (lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31). Because this phantom inventory is much larger than any reasonable base stock calculation, the OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] would result in zero orders for the remainder of the game if using default methods. To ensure the system can respond if inventory actually runs low, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to include an offset for these 2004 lost units. However, since on-hand (355) is already sufficient for the 5 remaining periods of the game (total demand expected ~380-400), no new orders are strictly necessary. I will set parameters to reflect the current demand regime while maintaining the explicit offset to correct the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 2,004 units (Lost orders: P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31). Winter demand regime (P38-P42) is stable at ~77 units/period. Use explicit mu_hat with +2004 offset to bypass backend order capping.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in a stable winter demand regime for women's basic T-shirts, with an average demand of approximately 77 units per period over the last five weeks (P39-P43). The 'In-transit' figure of 2004 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31), none of which have arrived despite being many periods overdue. With 294 units on hand and a mean demand of 77, we currently have enough physical stock to cover approximately 3.8 periods. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, no new order is physically necessary this period. However, the OR backend sees 'In-transit: 2004', which is far above any reasonable base stock level, effectively 'locking' the system from placing future orders. To ensure the backend can eventually place an order when on-hand stock depletes, I must continue to provide an explicit mu_hat that incorporates this 2004-unit offset. For Period 44, I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*77 + 2004 = 231.3 + 2004 = 2235.3. This ensures the backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline) remains functional.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand (P40-P44) has stabilized at a winter low of ~64 units/period. The SKU is a t-shirt, which is currently out of season. On-hand inventory is 239 units, which covers approximately 3.7 periods of current demand. The In-transit figure of 2,004 units is entirely comprised of phantom inventory from lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31). Because this phantom inventory far exceeds any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend's inventory-position logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted to offset the 2,004 units. However, given that on-hand inventory (239) is sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (ending Period 47) at the current demand rate (~64), no new orders are required. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and maintain the explicit offset strategy for consistency, though no order is expected to trigger.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P40-P44) confirmed stable at ~64 units/period. Phantom pipeline inventory remains constant at 2,004 units from lost shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in a stable winter low, with the P40-P45 average at approximately 64 units/period. On-hand inventory is 175 units, which covers approximately 2.7 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 2004 units consists entirely of lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31) which the OR backend still counts as pipeline inventory. Because these 2004 phantom units exceed any reasonable base stock level, the backend would normally place zero orders. To maintain the ability to order when on-hand inventory drops further, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as ((1 + Lead Time) * Forecasted Demand) + Phantom Pipeline Offset. With L=2 and demand=64, the requirement is 192 units. Adding the 2004 unit offset results in 2196. Since current on-hand (175) is still sufficient for the immediate lead time, no new order is required this period, but the parameter is set to ensure the system is ready for future periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a winter demand regime. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P40-P46), the mean demand is 73.9 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 83 units. The in-transit (pipeline) inventory is significantly inflated by 2,050 units, which are confirmed lost orders from previous periods (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because the pipeline is perceived as full. To ensure the base-stock logic operates correctly, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus an offset equal to the lost units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 73.9) + 2050 \u2248 2272. This forces the engine to recognize that the 2050 units are not arriving and to order based on the true net inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current low volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P40-P46) mean stabilized at 73.9 units/period. Phantom pipeline inventory due to lost orders (P3, P7, P12, P13, P17, P20, P28, P31) remains at 2,050 units, requiring explicit mu_hat offsets for all future periods until purged.
