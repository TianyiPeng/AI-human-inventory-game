Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand over the last 5 periods (samples provided in the seed data) has been [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], showing a clear upward trend as we move into February. This suggests we are exiting a winter trough and entering a spring demand regime. The mean of the last 5 samples is 204.8, but the most recent sample is 308. Given the upward trend and the seasonal nature of basic t-shirts in spring, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent acceleration in demand (averaging ~234 per period). Promised lead time (L) is 4. No shipments are in transit or on hand yet. I will set the OR parameters to reflect this recent growth while relying on the backend's default standard deviation calculations for volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which typically has stable demand, though the initial history shows a rising trend (148, 175, 160, 233, 308). In Period 1, demand was 266, but we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. An order of 343 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit with a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. This order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Given the limited history and the recent demand levels (233, 308, 266), the mean demand appears to have shifted upwards from the early samples. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 (averaging 233, 308, 266) to capture this higher regime (approx 269 per period). With L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical data (last 5 samples: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308) and recent demand (Period 1: 266, Period 2: 316) show a clear upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality transition in late February. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant backlogs/lost sales in P1 and P2 because the initial stock was zero and lead time is 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 674 units matches the orders from P1 (343) and P2 (331). Since promised lead time is 4, these won't arrive until Period 5 and 6 respectively. To address the inventory gap and the rising demand, I will use recent_N to capture the higher demand regime. N=3 is chosen as the demand has shifted upwards in the most recent periods compared to the older historical samples.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current Period is 4 (March 4). We have had 3 periods of history with demand [266, 316, 306], and the pre-game history demands were [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. There is a visible upward trend as we move into the spring season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6 START). Consequently, we have had 0 sales to date due to 0 on-hand inventory, while accumulating 'In-transit' stock. I will use the last 4 samples for demand (encompassing the most recent growth) to set the mean. The OR engine needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Mean of last 4: (233+308+266+316+306)/5 is approx 286. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this level.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. The historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the seed data and the 4 periods of game history) shows a significant upward trend and then stabilizing: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (seed) and [266, 316, 306, 283] (game). The mean of the game history demand is ~293. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in P1) should arrive during P5 (this period) and will be visible in the P5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (expected for L=4). Pipeline inventory is 1359. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime of ~293 units/period, and default for L since no evidence yet exists to suggest the promised lead time of 4 is incorrect.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 periods has been [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (provided in 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA') which seems to conflict with the 'GAME HISTORY' demand values [266, 316, 306, 283, 252]. Given the instructions to use historical demand as anchors, I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' demand values which average ~285 per period. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The current pipeline (In-transit) is 1164 units (Orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), plus 91 on-hand, totaling 1255. Expected demand for 5 periods at 285/unit is 1425. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 250-315 range).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand stable around 285 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods with an average of approximately 282 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270). The recent demand in the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is slightly lower (mean ~268), which might reflect post-launch stabilization. History confirms a lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 152 and in-transit is 1052 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). The pipeline covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the stable demand mean and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. Lead time L is set to default (4 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's lightweight jersey t-shirt, a staple garment. Recent demand in Period 7 saw a spike to 364 units, likely driven by spring seasonality as weather warms up in April. The previous 5 periods (P2-P6) averaged 285 units, but P7 is 27% higher than that average. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently high (965 units in-transit + 129 on-hand), but given the upward trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent increase while still anchoring to the core demand. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods as seen in the last three arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed in Period 7 (364 units), suggesting a seasonal spring increase compared to the previous 5-period average of 285.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak seasonal demand as we move into spring/summer. Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 7. Demand in Periods 1-6 averaged ~282 units. Periods 7 and 8 saw demand jump to 364 and 372 units respectively, representing a ~30% increase. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). To respond to the seasonal uptick, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (including the initial hint data of 308 and recent actuals 364, 372) which better reflects the current trend than the full history. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods perfectly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-8 average demand (368) is significantly higher than Period 1-6 average (282), aligning with spring seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe a stockout in Period 9 (sold 249 units with 0 ending inventory), though demand lowered slightly to 271. The previous demand regime shift (P7-P8) saw demand > 360 units. This product (Women's T-shirt) is entering peak spring season. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline (1268 units) includes orders from P6 (219), P7 (254), P8 (367), and P9 (428). The P6 order is expected to arrive during P10. Historical demand since the regime shift (P7-P9) averages ~336. Given the stockout in P9 and the seasonal context, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher spring demand level (avg ~336 * 5 = 1680) while acknowledging P9's dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its spring/summer peak season. Demand in the last four periods (P7-P10) averages 329 units, a significant step up from the early-period average of 282. Recent stockouts in P9 and P10 (ending inventory 0) indicate that demand is outstripping previous supply levels. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and high demand expected to continue through spring/summer, we need to maintain a higher base stock level to satisfy customers. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (avg ~330) for P7-P10 compared to P1-P6 (avg ~280), consistent with spring seasonality for T-shirts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand spring regime. Period 11 saw a significant spike (demand = 564), which is likely driven by warmer late April weather and typical spring/summer category growth. We are currently out of stock (on-hand = 0) because arrivals (254 units) were significantly lower than demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the Period 11 conclusion. To address the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher average demand of the last 5 periods (avg ~376), which is more representative of the current spring trend than the long-term history. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased volatility seen in the Period 11 spike. The L parameter remains at default (4) as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility and peak observed in Period 11 (564 units), confirming a high-demand spring phase for the T-shirt category.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', currently in the peak spring/early summer season (May 6). History shows a clear upward trend and significant volatility: P1-P6 averaged ~280 units, while P7-P12 averaged ~384 units, including a peak of 564. The last two periods (P11-P12) averaged 494 units, indicating the seasonal plateau is higher than initially estimated. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with significant unmet demand (stockouts in P9-P12). To capture the current seasonal high and account for recent volatility while building a safety buffer, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the spring shift (P7-P12 mean is ~384) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed since late March. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully established: P7-P12 average demand is 384 units (vs. earlier 280), with a recent two-period peak averaging 494 units, confirming May as a high-demand period for this spring T-shirt category.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Period 13 demand (304) showed a cooling from the late-April/early-May peaks (564, 424), yet remains higher than the early-season average. We have a clear lead time of 4 periods consistently observed. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in its peak seasonal window. While demand dropped to 304 last period, the pipeline is heavy (1709 units) from aggressive orders placed during the peak. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the elevated spring demand level (avg ~390 per period) while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat). This balances the need to maintain stock for May/June demand against the risk of overstocking as we move past the absolute peak seen in late April.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is in high seasonal demand during the spring/early summer. Over the last 8 periods (P7-P14), the demand has shifted significantly to an average of 381.1, compared to the initial baseline of ~282. Recent demand remains volatile but consistently higher, with the last two periods averaging 367.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as verified by the 'conclude' messages for Period 5 through Period 14 (all showing lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments; the pipeline inventory (1497 units) reflects the orders placed in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 which are yet to arrive. Given the seasonal peak, I'm setting mu_hat using a recent 8-period window (N=8) to capture the elevated spring demand regime while mitigating the extreme outlier from Period 11.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. This SKU is a lightweight T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the spring and early summer leading into June. Demand has significantly increased starting around Period 7 (late March), with recent demands specifically in the range of 424 to 564 units, except for a dip in Period 13. Specifically, Period 15 demand was 442, and the average demand over the last 9 periods (P7-P15) is approximately 388 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite an arrival of 258 units this period, because demand (442) exceeded available supply (380). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P11 order arrived in P15). Given the proximity to summer and the high recent volume, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (the 'high' season segment) to capture the higher average demand (388 * 5 = 1940) and set sigma_hat based on recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the seasonality without over-responding to the single extreme outlier in P11.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak demand phase for this lightweight jersey T-shirt (Period 17, June 3rd). A clear regime shift occurred around Period 7, with demand moving from a baseline of ~280 to a significantly higher mean. The last 4 periods (P13-P16) have shown consistent demand levels (304, 431, 442, 435), averaging 403 units per period. The spike in P11 (564) appears to have stabilized into a high-plateau seasonal phase during late May and early June. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 12 observed arrivals. Stockouts occurred in P15 because the order from P11 (258 units) was insufficient for the actual demand (442 units); however, the pipeline is now heavily loaded (1542 units). I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilized peak demand (~403 units/period) and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility. This will ensure the base_stock calculation (1+L)*mu_hat tracks the current requirements for the remainder of the high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for late spring/early summer (Period 13-16) at ~400 units/period, following the initial spring ramp-up.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked to 640 units (Date: 2019/6/3), significantly exceeding the recent plateau of ~400 units observed in Periods 13-16. This suggests a fresh early-summer surge for this T-shirt SKU. The current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and we rely entirely on the in-transit pipeline. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P13 order arrived safely in P17). For Period 18, I am targeting a higher demand regime (around 450 units/period) to account for the recent spike while maintaining a buffer for the (L+1) exposure period (5 periods). Using recent_N=5 captures the late-spring transition and the most recent spike (Avg P13-P17 = approx 450). I will use explicit L=4 to ensure the OR backend respects the stable observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed in P17 (640 units) following a 4-period plateau of ~400, indicating an early-summer peak for the T-shirt category.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer peak. Historical data shows a significant demand surge in Period 17 (640 units) and a subsequent high demand of 419 in Period 18. The current date (June 17) suggests we are firmly in the peak summer season for lightweight jersey basics. Recent demand (P17-P18) averages 529 units, a jump from the previous plateau of ~400. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has been stockout-sensitive (sold < demand in 7 of the last 10 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and stockout risk, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat (covering the transition to the 500+ range) and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed for June: P17-P18 average demand increased to 529 units, up from the P13-P16 plateau of ~400 units (+32%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late June (2019/6/24). Demand for this T-shirt SKU has entered a summer peak regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) is approximately 500 units (640, 419, 439), significantly higher than the mid-spring plateau of ~400. Specifically, P17 saw a massive spike of 640. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is very low (19 units), and we have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods (P15, P17, P18), indicating that the OR backend's previous settings were too conservative for this summer surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-volatility, high-demand summer peak. This will raise the base stock level to better cover the current demand regime and reduce stockout risk, even at the cost of slightly higher holding costs, which is justified by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (July 1st). The product is a lightweight T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer season. Historically, demand rose from ~280 (Feb-Mar) to ~400 (May) and peaked in June (Period 17: 640 units). The last four demands (P17-P20) were 640, 419, 439, and 301. While P20 showed a dip, early July usually sustains high volume for summer basics before any late-summer decline. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and current summer peak context (P17-P20 average ~450), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent peak of 640 with the more moderate 301-439 range, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance (sigma_hat) observed during the summer transition, maintaining a high service level for this high-profit ($4) vs low-holding-cost ($1) item.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains significantly high (2301 units) relative to recent average demand (~450), reflecting large orders placed during the June peak (Orders from P17-P20 total 2301 units). July 1st marks the potential start of the summer plateau or gradual tapering for T-shirts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering early July (2019/7/8), and the demand for T-shirts has shown a clear decline: Period 20 demand was 301, and Period 21 was 232. This follows the late-June peak (~470 range) and confirms that demand is tapering off as the summer peak passes. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 324 units, compared to the peak June average of over 500. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). We have a large 'In-transit' volume of 1918 units from orders placed during the high June period, which is more than sufficient to cover the current tapering demand across the lead time + 1 review period. To prevent excessive ending inventory and high holding costs as demand continues to soften, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the immediate downward trend, while maintaining the L parameter at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering confirmed: Average demand for P20-P21 dropped to 266 units, down from the June avg of 499 units (-46%), signaling the post-peak summer decline for the T-shirt category.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's T-shirt (610776002) is in a clear tapering phase after the June peak. Demand for the last three periods (P20-P22) has dropped to 301, 232, and 238 (average 257), confirming the transition to a post-peak summer plateau. On-hand inventory is currently high at 775 units, and in-transit inventory remains elevated at 1269 units (composed of orders from P19-P21: 701, 480, and 88 units). The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high pipeline inventory relative to the new lower demand regime (257 units/period), the current inventory position (775 on-hand + 1269 in-transit = 2044) significantly exceeds the projected base stock requirement for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 1285 units). I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the new lower demand regime and allow the backend to skip ordering until inventory levels normalize. Sigma_hat is also updated using N=3 to account for the reduced volatility in this tapering phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for mid-July: P20-P22 demand stabilized at an average of 257 units/period, marking a -48% reduction from the June peak (average 499).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has entered a clear post-peak summer decline. Demand has consistently tapered from a June peak (avg ~500) to a mid-July plateau of approximately 227 units/period (P21-P23: 232, 238, 212). Our on-hand inventory (1264) plus remaining in-transit (568) totaling 1832 units is extremely high relative to this new demand regime. Specifically, 1832 units cover over 8 periods of demand at the current rate of ~227, significantly exceeding the (L+1=5) period target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To minimize mounting holding costs while the inventory works through the system, I will continue to order zero units by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period demand regime (P21-P23), which represents the current 'low' summer plateau. This will keep the base stock level well below our current inventory position, preventing further orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau for late July confirmed: Period 21-23 average demand is 227 units, reflecting a -55% drop from the June peak and establishing the late-summer baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has entered a late-summer baseline following the June peak. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 21-24), demand has stabilized at an average of 222 units (232, 238, 212, 207), which is a significant drop from the spring/summer highs. Calendar context (late July) suggests this lower demand level is the new seasonal norm. On-hand inventory is currently very high (1537 units) due to large orders placed during the June peak (lead time 4). Given the current on-hand inventory already covers approximately 7 periods of demand at the current rate (1537 / 222 \u2248 6.9), and there are still 88 units in-transit (ordered P21), there is no immediate need to order more. The OR backend needs to be informed of this lower demand regime to avoid further overstocking and minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand baseline for late summer (late July onwards) confirmed at ~222 units/period, representing the end of the seasonal peak cycle.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has confirmed a post-summer seasonal baseline. Recent demands for Periods 21-25 are [232, 238, 212, 207, 154], showing a clear stabilization at a lower level compared to the June peak (~500). The current on-hand inventory is 1471 units, and there is no remaining in-transit inventory after the final large June orders arrived. Based on the late-summer mean of approximately 210 units/period (using recent_N where N=5), and a lead time of 4 periods, our base stock requirement (L+1) is approximately 1050 units. Since current on-hand (1471) significantly exceeds this requirement, the optimal strategy is to continue ordering 0 units to reduce holding costs while the excess inventory is naturally depleted. I will set mu_hat to reflect this new lower demand regime and use calculate for L as actual lead times have remained stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand baseline for August established: Periodic demand has settled near 210 units, a -58% reduction from the June peak, marking the start of the late-summer/pre-autumn cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-961.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt has clearly entered a late-summer/pre-autumn decline. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 102 units, following a steady tapering since the June peak. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is approximately 154 units ((207+154+102)/3), but the most recent 2 periods average 128 units. Given the high-end inventory level (1,369 units on-hand) relative to this reduced demand, no new orders are necessary. The pipeline inventory is now empty as all previously placed orders have arrived. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the lower 150-200 unit baseline, while sigma_hat will also reflect this more recent, less volatile period to prevent unnecessary safety stock accumulation. Lead time L remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift confirmed for mid-August: Period 25-26 demand averaged 128 units, indicating a further -40% drop from the late-July baseline (~220) as the summer season ends.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt SKU (610776002) has entered a significant downward trend as the summer season ends. Following the June peak (~500 units/period) and a late-July plateau (~220 units/period), the last three periods (P25-P27) have shown a further decline to an average of 125 units (154, 102, 120). This identifies a new late-August demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (1249 units), which at the current demand rate of ~125 units/period covers approximately 10 periods. Given the 1.0/unit holding cost and 4.0/unit profit, the OR engine will seek to minimize new orders while liquidating existing stock to avoid excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this latest low-demand regime, ensuring the system recognizes that no further inventory is needed for the current lead-time cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late August: Period 25-27 demand averaged 125 units, a -44% drop from the late-July baseline (~220), reflecting the clear end-of-season tapering for the T-shirt category.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues its late-summer decline as we move into late August (Period 29). The most recent four-period average demand (P25-P28) is 133.5 units, significantly lower than the late-July baseline of ~220 units and the June peak of ~500 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1091 units with 0 in-transit. Given the current demand rate of ~133 units/period, the current inventory covers over 8 periods of demand, which is far beyond the safety stock requirement for a 4-period lead time. No new orders have been placed since Period 21 to allow this surplus to bleed off. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the end-of-season tapering. The goal is to minimize further holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand baseline for late August confirmed: Period 25-28 demand averaged 134 units, approximately 27% of the June peak, confirming a low-demand late-summer/pre-autumn regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019 (Period 30). Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU confirms a significant seasonal decline as summer ends. The peak occurred in June (~500 units/period), followed by a tapering in July (~230 units/period), and a final drop to a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline in August. The last four periods (P26-P29) show demand of 102, 120, 158, and 140, averaging 130 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 951 units with zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a current demand rate of ~130, the on-hand inventory covers approximately 7 periods of demand, which exceeds the review + lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we are in a low-demand regime and heavily overstocked, the goal is to stop ordering and bleed down inventory to minimize holding costs. I will set L to 'calculate' (which has consistently been 4) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-August demand floor (~130 units), ensuring the OR engine recognizes the low-demand state and maintains the order at zero.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline of ~130 units/period (P26-P29 average: 130), confirming the end of the seasonal T-shirt cycle.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt) has stabilized at a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 133 units (102, 120, 158, 140, 145), consistent with the 'Period 30' carry-over insight of ~130 units/period. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 806 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. At the current rate of ~130 units/period, the total requirement is approximately 650 units. Since our current on-hand inventory (806) already exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent demand regime (N=5) to ensure the OR backend suppresses ordering while maintaining a high service level on the remaining stock. The 'explicit' method for sigma_hat is used to manually adjust for the lower volatility observed in this stable baseline regime compared to the overall history.

The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for the T-shirt SKU (610776002) has entered a stable, low-demand post-summer/pre-autumn phase.

On-hand inventory is 665 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, total coverage (on-hand + in-transit) of 665 units is sufficient for approximately 5.2 periods of demand at the current rate of ~128 units/period. Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the high current on-hand stock relative to the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P26-P31). This will lower the base stock level calculated by the OR engine, justifying the current zero-order policy.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the T-shirt SKU has stabilized at a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand is approximately 128.7 units per period, with very low volatility (standard deviation ~19.5). The current on-hand inventory is 530 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4), the total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 130 units/period * 5 periods = 650 units. Currently, on-hand (530) + in-transit (45) = 575 units. This indicates a small shortfall relative to the base stock level. I will use the recent 7 periods to define the current demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering as the season continues to wind down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at approximately 130 units/period for the September pre-autumn phase (P26-P32 average: 129).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has stabilized at a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline after a significant peak in June. Since Period 26, demand has remained consistent, with an average of approximately 131 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P26-P33). We are currently in Period 34 (late September), and there are no immediate seasonal drivers (like holidays or climate shifts) expected to spike T-shirt demand in the near term. On-hand inventory is 383 units, with 177 units in-transit (ordered in P32 and P33), totaling 560 units of pipeline inventory. Given the stable demand regime (avg ~131) and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (1+L) = 5 periods, which is approximately 655 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the stable post-peak regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the reduced volatility in this period compared to the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' (610776002) has stabilized in a late-season low-demand regime since late August. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has consistently averaged ~133 units per period (102, 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, 135, 147, 106). This represents the current pre-autumn/autumn baseline. On-hand inventory is 277 units and in-transit is 330 units (from orders in P32, P33, P34). Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, these in-transit units will arrive in P36 (45 units), P37 (132 units), and P38 (153 units). Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 607 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate of ~133/period. Since the goal is to maintain (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, current levels are slightly below target. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this stable late-season average and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the summer peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized at a low-demand, post-summer regime. For the last 10 periods (P26-P35), demand has averaged 123.9 units/period. Most recently, P34-P35 demand dropped below 100 units (106 and 85), suggesting a further minor tapering as we enter mid-October. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 192 units. In-transit inventory is 423 units (orders from P32, P33, P34, P35), which is sufficient to cover the next ~4 periods of demand at the current average rate (~125 * 4 = 500). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~122) and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand stability. The backend will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline (192 + 423 = 615) covers the projected base stock (approx 5 periods * 122 = 610 + safety stock).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed for mid-October: Period 34-35 demand averaged 95.5 units, a -25% drop from the September baseline (~130), indicating the final seasonal wind-down.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the T-shirt SKU '610776002' has shifted from a September baseline of ~130 units to a mid-October wind-down of ~90 units (P34-P36 average: 91.6). This matches the seasonal transition into late autumn/winter for lightweight jersey basics. On-hand inventory is 153 units and in-transit is 427 units (from orders in P33-P36). Total pipeline (580) comfortably covers the (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate of ~92 (~460 units). The OR engine needs to recognize the current lower demand level to avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P32 order arriving in P36. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime shift accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late October: Period 34-36 demand averaged 91.6 units, a -30% decrease from the September baseline (~130), reflecting the end-of-year seasonal wind-down for jersey basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' continues its late-October wind-down. For the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has stabilized at an average of 96 units/period (106, 85, 84, 109). This confirms the retreat from the September baseline (~130) as we approach November. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 176 on-hand and 295 in-transit (orders from P34-P36 totaling 153+93+49 = 295). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 471 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~96 units, we need approximately 480 units available. Our current inventory position (471) is almost exactly at the base stock level required for the current regime. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand end-of-season regime and avoid over-ordering during the final wind-down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for late October: P34-P37 average demand is 96 units/period, representing the final seasonal baseline before November.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this Jersey Basic T-shirt has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 92.4 units, confirming a significant drop from the September average of ~130. We are currently in a low-demand regime as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 251 units, and in-transit is 177 units (from P35, P36, and P38). Total inventory (428) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current average rate of ~92 units. The OR backend will likely recommend a small or zero order to maintain this lean position. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower late-season baseline and avoid overstocking during the year-end wind-down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for late autumn: P34-P38 average demand is 92.4 units/period, marking a 28% decrease from the September baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to trend downward as we move further into November (late autumn). Period 39 demand was 61 units, confirming the lower regime observed since Period 34. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 87 units per period. Current on-hand inventory (283) plus in-transit inventory (145: P36=49, P38=35, P39=61) totals 428 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Periods 40-44 (L+1 = 5 periods). At the current mean of ~87 units, the required base stock is approximately 435 units. Since our pipeline (428) is nearly sufficient and we are in a seasonal wind-down phase, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the late autumn baseline and avoid over-ordering jersey basics as winter approaches. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for November confirmed lower: P34-P39 average demand is 87 units/period, reflecting the pre-winter seasonal low for the T-shirt category.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear late-autumn seasonal low. The current demand regime (P34-P40) has stabilized at an average of 84.6 units per period, significantly lower than the September average of 130. Current on-hand inventory (263) plus in-transit stock (138) totals 401 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current average of ~85 units/period, target inventory is 425 units. Since 401 units are already accounted for, only a small replenishment is needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-autumn baseline (P34-P40) while maintaining lead time 'L' as 'default' (fixed at 4).

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P34-P40): Average demand has settled at 84.6 units/period, a -35% reduction from the September baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt is in a late-autumn/pre-winter seasonal low, consistent with the product being a lightweight jersey item. The current date (late November) supports a low-demand regime before the cycle potentially resets. Average demand over the last 8 periods (P34-P41) has been 82.4 units, with a very stable downward trend. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific low-demand plateau. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand (196) and in-transit (194) inventory (total 390) is sufficient for approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate (~82 units/period), covering the lead time window. No order was received this period but it was expected (ordered P37, value 0), so the pipeline is behaving as expected.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/November demand regime confirmed: P34-P41 average demand is 82.4 units/period, showing high Stability at a seasonal low for this category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' continues to fluctuate within a low-demand winter regime. While Period 42 showed a slight uptick in demand (109 vs. recent avg of ~80), this is likely a short-term variation rather than a sustained shift. Period 43 is dated Dec 2, where demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts typically remains at seasonal lows. The current on-hand inventory (122) plus in-transit units (214) provides a total of 336 units. Given the recent average demand of approximately 82 units per period (P34-P41), the current pipeline covers more than 4 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 34-42) to capture the current low-demand winter baseline while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44), nearing the game's end at Period 47. The product is a lightweight Jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal trough. Demand has stabilized at a low late-autumn/early-winter baseline. Over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the average demand is 83.3 units per period. The most recent demand (P43) was 61 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 73.4 units, showing a slight further decline as we enter December. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 122 units, and in-transit is 270 units, totaling 392 units. Given the projected demand of ~75-80 units per period for the remaining 4 periods, current total inventory (392) significantly exceeds the expected total remaining demand (approx. 320 units). To maximize profit and minimize final holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the most current low-demand baseline and using default settings for lead time and sigma.

Carry-over insight: December demand baseline established: P39-P43 average demand is 73.4 units/period, down from the October-November average of ~85 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is at its seasonal low as of mid-December. Period 44 concluded with a demand of 55 units, and the average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 62.2 units, confirming the late-autumn/winter baseline established in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 109 units on-hand and 466 units in-transit (including larger orders from P43 and P44), the pipeline inventory is currently sufficient to cover the expected low demand for the remaining 3 periods of the game. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this established winter baseline (approx. 82 units/period including lead time multiplier) and use calculate for the lead time as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that this 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt SKU has passed its seasonal peak (June) and has been in a sustained tapering/low-demand phase throughout late autumn. The average demand for the last seven periods (P39-P45) is approximately 68 units/period, down from the approximately 85 units/period seen in October. Recent demand has been stable but low (P43-P45: 61, 55, 64). Arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods. With 101 units on hand and 410 units in-transit (reflecting larger orders placed in P42-P44 to prepare for the end of the year or anticipate a floor in demand), the system is well-covered for the (L+1) horizon. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (N=7 covers P39-P45) to capture the current late-December/early-winter demand level of ~68 units/period, and default methods for lead time and sigma.

Carry-over insight: December/Winter demand regime confirmed at ~68 units/period (P39-P45 average), slightly lower than the November average (~82 units), reflecting typical apparel seasonality for jersey basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Women's Everyday Basics' T-shirt has stabilized at a winter seasonal low. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P39-P46) is approximately 72 units per period, with Period 46 showing a slight uptick to 92 (likely a small holiday or post-holiday fluctuation). Total in-transit inventory is 355 units (from P43, P44), and on-hand is 64. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume (covering nearly 5 periods of demand at the current average) and the low seasonal demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the winter baseline of ~72 units per period (multiplied by 1+L=5). This should prevent further over-ordering while the system waits for the 355 units to arrive. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to reflect the low volatility seen in the current stable regime.
