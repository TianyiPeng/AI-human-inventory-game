Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt). Historical demand shows an upward trend [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. The last two periods show a significant jump (233 and 308), suggesting a regime shift or seasonal ramp-up as we enter mid-February. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic T-shirt', demand is likely to remain elevated or continue growing. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth [160, 233, 308] while smoothing slightly, and N=5 for sigma to account for the increasing volatility. Lead time is set to 'default' (promised = 2) as there is no historical arrival data to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. History shows an upward trend in demand: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] followed by an actual demand of 266 in Period 1. The average of the last 5 historical samples is 204.8, but the recent demand (233, 308, 266) suggests a higher regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent uptick (average ~269). The promised lead time is 2, and since we just started, there are no 'conclude' messages to verify actual lead time yet, so I will stick with the default lead time. The 343 units ordered in P1 are in-transit and expected to arrive in P3. With 0 on-hand and 266 lost sales in P1, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand to recover and maintain service levels.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current history shows a clear upward demand trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (pre-history) followed by [266, 316] (observed periods). The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 280. The actual lead time for the first order was 1 period (ordered P1, arrived P2), which is faster than the promised 2 periods. However, to be conservative and avoid stockouts during this growth phase, I will use L=1 for lead-time logic but base my demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime. Since demand is trending up, I'll use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the shift from the low 200s to 300+. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: historical mean ~180 has increased to ~290 over the last 3 periods (+60% increase). Actual lead time observed as 1 period (P1 order arrived P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 599 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P3). Historical demand shows a significant upward shift: the pre-game mean was ~197, but the last 3 periods (P1-P3) averaged 296, indicating a new regime. Although the promised lead time is 2, P1 arrived in 1 period (observed at start of P3). However, the P2 order did not arrive in P3, suggesting lead time may be reverting to 2 or experiencing variability. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) to be safe. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 5 periods [160, 233, 308, 266, 316, 306] which captures the current high-demand regime, resulting in a (1+L) * mean forecast. Sigma_hat will also be based on this recent window to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~180 to ~296 (+64%) over the last 5 periods. Lead time is variable: P1 order was 1 period, but P2 order is >= 2 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Current history shows a significant demand shift from the pre-game mean (~180) to a much higher sustained level averaging ~296 over the last 5 periods (266, 316, 306, 283, 308). The promised lead time (L) is 2. While Period 1 arrived in 1 period, subsequent orders from Period 2 and 3 have not arrived yet. Period 2's order is now at L=3 (placed P2, current P5 start), indicating potential lead time volatility or delays. On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 909 units in transit (P2, P3, P4 orders). Since we are out of stock and demand is stable at the new high level, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the shift and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat. For L, I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to incorporate the observed lead time variance, noting that while P1 was fast, current arrivals are delayed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand sustained at ~296 (+64% vs initial) for 5 periods. Lead time instability: P1 order L=1, but P2 order is now L>=3, suggesting 2 might be an underestimate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Current demand over the last 5 periods (P1-P5) has stabilized at a high level (mean = 284.6) compared to the initial historical seed of ~180. We have seen significant stockouts in P1, P3, and P4 due to lead time variability. Observed lead times are inconsistent: P1 arrived in 1 period (L=1), whereas P2 arrived in 3 periods (L=3). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, orders from P3 (268 units) and P4 (310 units) are in-transit (Total 578). Since P3 was ordered 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived, we are facing L >= 3 again. To protect against this instability and the sustained higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period window to capture the current mean (~285) and setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays in P2 and the pending P3 order, ensuring the base stock covers a longer horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1 order L=1, P2 order L=3. P3 order is currently L >= 3. Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~285 (+58% vs historical seed) over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial seed data. The last 6 periods show a mean demand of ~282 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270). Lead times have been inconsistent: P1=1, P2=3, P3=Lost or >4 (ordered P3, still not arrived by P7 start), P4=2. Given P3's order is significantly overdue, I suspect it may be lost or delayed. However, the pipeline (597 units) includes P3 (268) and P6 (329). If P3 is lost, we need more stock. To compensate for the high lead-time variability and the risk of the lost P3 shipment, I will set L=3 (explicitly higher than the promised 2) to ensure the base stock covers a longer window. I will use the recent mean (N=6) of ~282 to set mu_hat for (1+L)=4 periods. This results in mu_hat = 1128. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly unstable (ranging 1 to 3+ periods); Period 3 order (268 units) is now 4 periods old and potentially lost. Demand has maintained a new regime of ~282 units/period (+56% vs seed) for 6 consecutive periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand analysis shows a sustained high-demand regime; the last 7 periods have an average demand of 294 units, significantly higher than the initial seed. Period 7 saw a spike to 364 units, likely due to spring seasonality. Regarding lead times: P1 was 1 period, P2 was 3 periods, P4 was 2 periods. Critically, the P3 order (268 units) is now 5 periods overdue and must be considered lost, as P4 (ordered later) has already arrived. The P5 order was 0 units. Therefore, the current in-transit (979 units) consists of P6 (329 units) and P7 (382 units), totaling 711 units. The reported in-transit of 979 includes the 'ghost' P3 order of 268. To compensate for the lost shipment and the high demand spike, I am using L=2 (the promised lead time, as actuals average to 2.0 excluding the lost P3), and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~294) while ignoring the lower historical seed. This will signal the OR backend to place a larger order to replenish the 0 on-hand inventory and account for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (268 units) confirmed lost: P4 (ordered later) arrived in P6 while P3 remains outstanding for 5 periods. Demand regime avg is 294 units (last 7 periods), with a seasonal spike to 364 in P7 (early April).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand has significantly increased from the initial seed (avg ~180) to a sustained new regime. Over the last three periods (P6-P8), demand has averaged 335 units (270, 364, 372), indicating a seasonal upward trend as we move into April. Lead times have been volatile: P1=1, P2=3, P4=2, P6=2. The order from P3 is confirmed lost. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) with 650 units in transit (P7 order of 382 and P8 order of 0, though P7 is expected this period). To account for the recent seasonal acceleration, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the shift from ~280 to ~330+. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (2.0 periods), which aligns with the promised lead time while acknowledging past variance. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a stable buffer against the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Demand averaged 335 units over P6-P8 (+86% vs seed, +14% vs previous regime). Spring seasonality for 'T-shirt' category is actively driving volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (mid-April). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is currently in its peak spring/summer demand window. Historical demand shows a clear upward shift: the mean of the first 5 periods was ~284, but the average of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 319, including a peak of 372 in P8. Demand is currently 0 in P9 ending inventory due to a stockout, despite demand being 271. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this higher seasonal average (~319), which, multiplied by (1+L) where L=2, results in a base stock level that targets covering ~957 units. Regarding lead time, we have seen values of 1, 3, 2, and 2 periods. The P3 order is confirmed lost. Average lead time (excluding the lost P3) is (1+3+2+2)/4 = 2.0. Using the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate here as it captures the average including the variability. For sigma_hat, recent_N=4 will capture the higher volatility seen during the seasonal ramp-up.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The SKU 610776002 is a women's T-shirt, which is experiencing a seasonal demand surge as spring progresses. Recent demand (P7-P10) has averaged 329 units, a significant increase over the initial baseline. The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual arrivals have been unstable: P1 (L=1), P2 (L=3), P4 (L=2), P6 (L=2). Importantly, the P3 order (268 units) is now 8 periods old and must be considered lost; it remains in the 'In-transit' count (706 total = P3(268) + P7(382) + P9(52) + P10(4)). Since the P3 order is lost, the OR backend's inventory calculation (In-transit + On-hand) will be inflated by 268 units, causing it to under-order or not order at all. To correct for this 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I forecast demand for the (L+1)=3 period window (current + lead time) based on the recent average of 329 units/period, which equals 987 units. To offset the 268 lost units, I add them to the mu_hat (987 + 268 = 1255). This forces the backend to place an order despite the 706 in-transit units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (268 units) confirmed lost after 8 periods of non-arrival; mu_hat must be adjusted upward to offset phantom in-transit inventory until the pipeline clears. Seasonal T-shirt demand stabilized at ~330 units/period for the April spring peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/04/29. We are dealing with a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter late April/May. Demand in Period 11 spiked to 564 units, well above the previous regime of ~330. The Period 3 order (268 units) is confirmed lost, as orders from P4, P6, and P9 have all arrived. This creates a dangerous 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline (268 units) that the OR backend's capped policy will subtract from the base stock, potentially leading to under-ordering. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I am forecasting demand at 450 units/period (reflecting the recent surge) and then adding the 268 units of lost pipeline to the total mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon. Calculating mu_hat: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Units = (1 + 2) * 450 + 268 = 1618. Lead time L is kept at the default 2, as recent successful arrivals (P6, P9) arrived in 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand spike in late April: Period 11 demand reached 564 (+70% vs previous regime). Total mu_hat adjusted to compensate for 268 lost units from Period 3 still lingering in pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6th. The product is a women's T-shirt, which is in peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand has spiked significantly, with Period 11 and 12 averaging 494 units, compared to the previous regime of ~330. I am using recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate high-demand surge. Crucially, Period 3 order (268 units) is confirmed lost (10 periods old), but remains in 'In-transit' (pipeline inventory). The OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' inventory from the base stock. To compensate and ensure the backend actually places an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base stock for (L+1=3) periods using the current demand mean (~494) and add the lost 268 units as a buffer to offset the pipeline deduction: (3 * 494) + 268 \u2248 1750. Lead time (L) is set to 2, as recent shipments (P9, P10) arrived in 2 periods, though instability remains a risk.

Carry-over insight: May peak seasonality confirmed: Demand averaged 494 units over P11-P12 (+50% vs April average). Period 3 order (268 units) is definitively lost but still impacts pipeline calculations.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May, which is peak season for women's 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts. Demand has surged significantly, with Period 11 and 12 seeing 564 and 424 units respectively (avg ~494). Period 13 demand dropped to 304, but this is likely due to zero on-hand inventory throughout the period, potentially undercounting true latent demand. The 'in-transit' pipeline of 1868 units includes 268 units from Period 3 that are confirmed lost (ordered 10 periods ago, well past the L=2 promised lead time). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to artificially inflate the target. Calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods) is ~500 * 3 = 1500 units. To offset the 268 'phantom' units that won't arrive, I set mu_hat to 1768. Sigma is set higher (explicitly) to account for recent high volatility and the stockout risk. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P9, P10) arrived in 2 periods, despite the P3 loss.

Carry-over insight: May peak seasonality for T-shirts confirmed: demand potential ~500 units/period. Period 3 order (268 units) remains 'in-transit' but is definitively lost, requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline logic.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 15 (2019/05/20). Demand for the 'T-shirt' category is in a May seasonal peak, averaging 386 units over the last 3 periods (P12-P14), with a previous spike of 564 in P11. The pipeline inventory (1480 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments: P3 (268 units) and P7 (382 units) total 650 'phantom' units that will never arrive but reduce the OR backend's order quantity. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: 1) True demand forecast (L=2) for 3 periods (L+1) is ~400 units/period * 3 = 1200 units. 2) Phantom inventory offset = 650 units. 3) Target mu_hat = 1200 + 650 = 1850 units. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) is high enough to trigger an order despite the 1480 units in-transit. Lead time is set to 'calculate' (average ~2.2) to reflect the variability between 2 and 3 periods seen in recent arrivals (P11 arrived with L=3).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed: 650 units (P3: 268, P7: 382) are definitively/likely lost and must be offset by inflating mu_hat. May demand regime for T-shirts stabilized at ~400 units/period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand for the Womens T-shirt SKU remains in a high-demand regime, averaging ~400 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15). A critical issue is the pipeline inventory distortion: 650 units (P3: 268, P7: 382) are definitively lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. Additionally, the P12 order (630 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2), suggesting either a delay or a third lost shipment. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this 'phantom' inventory, I must inflate mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the lost units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat yields a base demand of ~400/period. For (L+1)=3 periods, this is 1200. I add the 650 lost units to this total to bypass the pipeline deduction. Lead time is set to 2 (promised), as most successful deliveries arrive in 2-3 periods. Sigma is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the current peak season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed: 650 units (P3, P7) are lost and must be offset by mu_hat inflation. May demand regime stabilized at ~400 units/period. P12 order (630 units) is currently 2 periods overdue, indicating further lead-time instability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens T-shirt) is in a peak June demand regime, with demand averaging ~435 units over the last 3 periods (P14-P16). The pipeline inventory (1556 units) is severely distorted by lost or significantly delayed shipments: Period 3 (268 units, 14 periods old), Period 7 (382 units, 10 periods old), and Period 12 (630 units, 5 periods old, promised 2). These 1,280 units are effectively 'phantom' stock that prevent the OR backend from ordering. To trigger a replenishment order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units to bypass the pipeline subtraction. Calculation: Target demand for 3 periods (L=2) is 3 * 435 = 1,305 units. To offset the 1,280 lost units, I set mu_hat to 1,305 + 1,280 = 2,585. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the inflated pipeline, allowing for a necessary order to meet June demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this high-demand summer period.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion significantly worsened: 1,280 units (P3, P7, P12) are now confirmed lost or severely delayed beyond operational utility, requiring continued mu_hat inflation to force orders. June demand regime for T-shirts stabilized at ~435 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: We are in early June (2019/6/10), peak season for 'Womens T-shirts'. Demand in P17 spiked to 640 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~435. The pipeline is severely distorted: In-transit is 2403 units, but at least 1,280 of these (P3, P7, P12) are confirmed lost or effectively obsolete. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to cap orders (base_stock - pipeline), meaning these 'ghost' units prevent necessary new orders. I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to bypass this calculation. The current 'real' demand regime is ~450-500 units, but with 1,280 ghost units in the pipeline and a promised lead time of 2 (L+1=3), I need to add ~1280 to the target base stock. Target Base Stock = (3 * 500) + 1280 = 2780. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures the OR logic emits an order despite the 2403 units in-transit. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P14, P15, P16) show L=3, 2, 1, averaging out to ~2.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion reached 1,280 units in P17 (P3, P7, P12 lost). June demand spike confirmed in P17 (640 units), suggesting a regime shift towards 500+ units/period for early summer.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is June 17, peak summer season for women's lightweight T-shirts. Demand has shifted from a ~430 regime in May to a ~500+ regime in June (observed 640 in P17, 419 in P18). The primary challenge is severe pipeline distortion caused by lost or critically delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P3 (268), P7 (382), and P12 (630) totaling 1,280 units are effectively lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 by 4-15 periods. Additionally, P16 (165), P17 (958), and P18 (553) are in transit. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (2,956 units) from the base stock. Because 1,280 of those units are 'phantom' inventory, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the OR engine places a new order. The required base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~1,500 units) plus the phantom inventory (1,280), totaling 2,780 units. I set mu_hat explicitly to 2,780 and L to 2 (promised). Sigma_hat is set to 250 (recent_N=5) to account for high volatility (419 to 640).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 1,280 units (P3, P7, P12 confirmed lost). Summer demand regime for T-shirts established at 500+ units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Late June (Early Summer) for a T-shirt SKU. Recent demand has established a regime around 430-500 units, with a peak of 640 in P17. Inventory management is severely complicated by a 'phantom' pipeline: P3 (268), P7 (382), and P12 (630) are confirmed lost or severely delayed (total 1,280 units). The OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent ordering because it believes these 1,280 units are coming. 

Lead Time: Observed lead times are highly variable (1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3). Most recent is 3. I will use L=3 to cover the risk.

Demand (mu_hat): The current demand regime (last 5 periods) is approx 475 units. However, I must inflate mu_hat to bypass the 1,280 lost units in the pipeline. Total required mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Lost units = (475 * 4) + 1280 = 1900 + 1280 = 3180. Setting mu_hat to 3180 units using 'explicit'.

Sigma_hat: Demand volatility is high due to summer peaks. Using recent_N=5 to capture the summer variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 1,280 units (P3, P7, P12 lost). Summer demand regime for T-shirts remains strong at 450-500+ units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are in the peak summer demand regime for women's T-shirts. Recent demand (P17-P20) has averaged 450 units, despite a dip to 301 in P20. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 3336 units is severely inflated by lost shipments. Confirmed lost/stale orders include P3 (268), P7 (382), and P12 (630), totaling 1,280 units. These 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculating it as (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Expected demand is ~450, L=2, so base mu_hat is 1350. Adding the 1,280 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 2630. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 1,280 unit pipeline distortion. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P16, P14) averaged L=2-3, and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility of the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 1,280 units (P3, P7, P12 lost). July demand regime expected to maintain 450-500 units/period following June patterns.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 22 (July 8) shows on-hand inventory of 321 units following the arrival of the Period 18 order (553 units, L=3). Recent demand has cooled slightly (232 in P21, 301 in P20) from the June peak, but the 'T-shirt' category remains in the summer season. The critical issue remains the significant pipeline distortion of 1,280 units (Orders from P3, P7, and P12), which have long exceeded the observed lead-time range (1-3 periods) and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (pipeline_inventory) from its base_stock target, these 1,280 'ghost units' prevent it from ordering enough to meet current demand. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1+L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Units. With L=2 and a forecasted demand of ~400 units, the baseline mu_hat would be 1,200. Adding the 1,280 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 2,480. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - 2783 in-transit) still triggers a sufficient order to maintain stock levels. Sigma_hat is set to 200 via 'explicit' to account for high demand volatility during the transition from peak summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 1,280 units (P3, P7, P12 lost). Demand cooling slightly in early July (230-300 units) but summer seasonality for T-shirts continues to require ~400 unit readiness.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), the SKU (Women's T-shirt) is in a mid-summer phase where demand has cooled from the May/June peak (~450-500) to a more moderate level (~230-240 over the last two periods). However, the major challenge remains the massive 'pipeline inventory' distortion. There are 2,783 units currently in-transit, but history confirms that P3 (268), P7 (382), and P12 (630) are definitively lost or unrecoverable, totaling 1,280 phantom units. Additionally, the P17 order (958 units) is now 6 periods old (lead time L=5+), significantly exceeding the promised L=2 and recent L=3. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is inflated to offset the 1,280 lost units plus the potentially stuck P17 order. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to cover 3 periods of expected demand (approx 300/period) plus the 1,280 lost units to force the system to maintain a real-world safety stock despite the pipeline bloat. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent recent arrival delay.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion persists at 1,280 units (P3, P7, P12 lost). P17 order (958 units) is now 6 periods old, suggesting either a severe delay or a new lost shipment, which further blocks automated ordering. Mid-July demand has stabilized at ~240 units/period, down from early summer peaks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of high inventory distortion. On-hand inventory is 0, while 'In-transit' is 2,783 units. History confirms that P3 (268 units), P7 (382 units), and P12 (630 units) are almost certainly lost, totaling 1,280 'phantom' units. Additionally, the P17 order (958 units) is now 7 periods old (ordered P17, now P24) and likely lost or severely delayed, bringing the phantom total to 2,238 units. The OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline' from the base stock, preventing new orders. Current demand has stabilized at a lower post-peak summer regime of ~230 units/period (last 3 periods). To force the backend to place an order and overcome the 2,238 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Expected demand for 3 periods (L=2) is ~700. Adding 2,238 units requires a mu_hat of ~2,938. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 3,000 to ensure a safety margin and signal the need for fresh stock to the OR engine, while using explicit L=2 to reflect the promised lead time despite the recent shipping failures.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 2,238 units: P3, P7, P12, and now P17 (958 units, 7 periods old) are confirmed lost/severely delayed. Demand has cooled from June peaks to a mid-summer regime of ~230 units/period (P21-P23 avg: 227).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently suffering from a massive pipeline distortion due to lost or severely delayed shipments totaling 2,238 units (P3: 268, P7: 382, P12: 630, P17: 958). Because the OR backend counts all 'In-transit' units against the target base stock, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is inflated to offset these ghost units. Current demand has stabilized at a mid-summer regime of ~220 units/period (avg of P21-P24: 222). To ensure the OR engine places an order, mu_hat must be set to: (Expected Demand for L+1 periods) + (Lost Pipeline Units). With a lead time (L) of 2, L+1 = 3. Expected demand = 3 * 220 = 660. Total mu_hat = 660 + 2238 = 2898. I will use the 'explicit' method to force this value, as 'recent_N' or 'default' would result in a zero-order due to the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 2,238 units: P3, P7, P12, and P17 (958 units) are confirmed lost/severely delayed. Demand has cooled to a mid-summer regime of ~220 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), demand for the 'T-shirt' category has cooled significantly from its June peak (640 units) to a late-summer regime averaging 205 units over the last 3 periods (P23-P25: 212, 207, 154). The pipeline inventory remains severely distorted by lost shipments: P3 (268), P7 (382), P12 (630), P17 (958), and P20 (545) are all significantly past their expected arrival dates and are highly likely lost. The total 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline is approximately 2,783 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed this phantom balance. Given the current on-hand inventory of 199 and a forecast of ~200 units/period, we need to bypass the pipeline logic to ensure we don't stock out as the summer ends. I am using 'explicit' mu_hat set to 3600 (approx. 2783 phantom units + 800 units for 4 periods of demand) to force the OR backend to maintain availability despite the blocked pipeline. L is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals (P24 arriving in P25) show lead times are fluctuating between 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 2,783 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 confirmed lost/severely delayed). Late-summer demand regime for T-shirts has cooled to ~200 units/period (P23-P25 avg: 191).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the T-shirt category is entering a late-summer cooling phase. Demand has dropped from June peaks (>500) to a more modest regime (P23-P26 average ~168 units). The pipeline is severely distorted by lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: P3 (268), P7 (382), P12 (630), P17 (958), and P20 (545) are all missing, totaling 2,783 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 3,450, while only the recent P26 order (667) is likely to arrive. To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which sees a huge pipeline and refuses to order\u2014I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'phantom' pipeline inventory plus the required base stock. I estimate the current demand regime at ~170 units/period. For a lead time of 2, a normal base stock (L+1) would be ~510 units. To force a new order of approximately 200 units (anticipating further seasonal decline), I set mu_hat to 3,100 (approximately the 2,783 lost units + 317 units). Sigma_hat is kept at a moderate level (N=5) to handle the recent volatility in the cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 2,783 units: P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20 are confirmed lost or severely delayed. Late-summer demand regime for T-shirts has shifted down significantly to ~170 units/period (P24-P26 avg: 154).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/8/19 (Late Summer). Demand for the T-shirt SKU (610776002) has entered a low-season regime, with the last four periods averaging 144.5 units (down from the 400-500 unit peaks in May/June). The pipeline is severely distorted by 2,783 units of 'in-transit' inventory that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). To ensure the OR engine places orders despite this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and inflated by the amount of the lost stock plus the safety stock requirement for the current regime. I calculate the target base stock for the current regime (L=2) as: (1+L) * mean(P24-P27) + 1.64 * std(P24-P27) * sqrt(1+L) \u2248 (3 * 145) + (1.64 * 45 * 1.73) \u2248 435 + 127 = 562. Adding the 2,783 lost units, the required mu_hat is approximately 3,345. I set mu_hat to 3,400 to ensure replenishment triggers. Sigma is set based on the recent lower volatility of the late-summer period (N=4).

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (August) confirmed at ~145 units/period (P24-P27 avg: 144.5), a significant decrease from early summer peaks. Pipeline distortion remains constant at 2,783 units lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for the 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' is in a late-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is approximately 148 units, down significantly from early summer peaks of 500+. The 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) currently shows 2,824 units, but based on the history, a significant portion is lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 totaling 2,824 units exactly). These units will likely never arrive, yet the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock. To bypass this and ensure the system continues to order to meet the current demand regime (~150 units/period), I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the 'phantom' pipeline (2,824) plus the required (L+1) buffer. For L=2, (L+1)=3. Total target = 2,824 + (3 * 150) = 3,274. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to force this offset and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility in the current cooling regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion remains at 2,824 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 confirmed lost/severely delayed). Late-summer demand (August) has settled at a regime of ~150 units/period. mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 2,824 phantom units to allow new orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 30. The product is a T-shirt (610776002) entering the post-summer/early autumn season. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime averaging ~145 units per period over the last 4 weeks (P26-P29). The primary challenge remains the massive 'pipeline distortion' of 2,824 units which are confirmed lost or severely delayed (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it will not order anything unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed this phantom inventory. To ensure a fresh order covers the lead time (L=2) and current period, we need a base stock of approx (1+L)*150 = 450 units. However, to bypass the 2,824 phantom units and 346 on-hand units, the target base stock must be at least 3,170. We set mu_hat explicitly to 3,300 to force a small maintenance order and ensure availability as the season shifts, while keeping L at the promised 2 to avoid over-ordering through the cap mechanism.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion remains at 2,824 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 confirmed lost). Late-summer demand (August) has settled at a regime of ~145 units/period. mu_hat requires significant inflation (approx +2800 units) to offset phantom pipeline inventory until those shipments are cleared or the system is reset.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has settled into a late-summer/early-autumn regime averaging ~145 units/period (P27-P30: 120, 158, 140, 145). The primary operational challenge remains the severe pipeline distortion. We have 2,989 units 'In-transit', but the vast majority are historical orders (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) that are definitively lost or delayed beyond operational relevance (over 10-27 periods old). Without intervention, the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent all new orders because it believes nearly 3,000 units are arriving. To bypass this and ensure we maintain stock for the actual demand of ~145 units, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 3,300 units. This value is calculated as ((L+1) * 145) + 2865 (the approximate volume of lost shipments). This 'tricks' the backend into seeing a requirement that exceeds the phantom pipeline, allowing a maintenance order to be placed. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P24, P26) have shown a return to a 1-period lead time, though we must remain cautious of the volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion persists: ~2,865 units are confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Late-summer/Early-autumn demand regime stabilized at ~145 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16), the demand for this 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt has settled into a late-summer/early-autumn regime averaging ~145 units per period (P28-P31 demands: 158, 140, 145, 141). The primary challenge remains the massive 'pipeline distortion' caused by 2,865 units from orders P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20 that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' quantity from the calculated base stock, which would normally result in zero orders. To force the system to place necessary orders for the current demand regime (~145 units/period), I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods plus the phantom pipeline. With L=2, the base requirement is 145 * 3 = 435 units. Adding the lost 2,865 units yields a required mu_hat of approximately 3,300. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) produces a non-zero order to maintain on-hand inventory as the current stock (60 units) is depleted. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion persists: 2,865 units confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Autumn demand regime stable at ~145 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (T-shirt) has transitioned into a stable autumn demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 140 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). The primary challenge remains 'pipeline distortion': a total of 2,824 units from orders P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20 are definitively lost or severely delayed (over 10 periods old), yet they remain in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation. To force the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be inflated to cover the expected demand plus the phantom inventory. Current in-transit is 3,095. Subtracting the lost units (2,824) leaves a functional pipeline of 271 units (P31 and P32 orders). With a current demand regime of ~140/period and a lead time of 2, the 'true' base stock should be ~420. To bypass the 2,824 unit blockage, I set mu_hat to 3,244 (2,824 + 420). This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order to maintain stock for the upcoming weeks.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (late September), demand for this t-shirt SKU has stabilized into an autumn regime of approximately 140-150 units per period (the average of the last 6 periods is 144). The pipeline inventory remains severely distorted by lost shipments from earlier in the year (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20), totaling approximately 2,865 phantom units that the OR backend still counts as 'in-transit'. To ensure the backend places orders to meet actual demand, mu_hat must be significantly inflated to counteract this phantom inventory. With L=2 and a review period of 1, the backend targets (L+1) periods of demand. Base stock = (1+L)*mu + safety_stock. To trigger an order when on-hand is ~77 and phantom in-transit is ~2865, mu_hat needs to be set high enough so that (3 * mu_hat) > (77 + 2865). Setting mu_hat to 1100 (which represents an effective forecast of ~366 units per period) will ensure the base stock calculation overcomes the pipeline blockage while maintaining a buffer for the current stable demand of ~145.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime for T-shirts confirmed stable at ~145 units/period (P28-P33 avg: 144.3). Pipeline distortion remains at ~2,865 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 confirmed lost).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (early October), demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has stabilized at an autumn regime of ~145 units per period (P28-P34 average). However, the system is suffering from massive pipeline distortion. There are 3,033 units currently 'in-transit', but historical analysis confirms that approximately 2,865 of these units (from P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20) are definitively lost or delayed beyond operational utility. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline from the calculated base stock, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to bypass this phantom inventory. To ensure a target order of approximately 200 units (covering 1.5 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while account for lead time variance), I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 3,233 (2,865 lost units + 368 target inventory). I use 'calculate' for L to reflect the erratic actual lead times (ranging 1-3 periods) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion stabilized at ~2,865 units lost. Autumn demand for T-shirts remains constant at ~145 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is mid-October (2019/10/14) for a 'Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand has cooled significantly from summer peaks, with the last 8 periods averaging 133 units, and the most recent 2 periods dropping further to 106 and 85. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this lower late-autumn regime using recent_N=8. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 3,253 units 'in-transit', which includes several confirmed lost/extremely overdue shipments: P3 (268), P7 (382), P12 (630), P17 (958), and P20 (545), totaling 2,783 units. To bypass the OR engine's logic which subtracts this phantom pipeline from the order, I must inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Target base stock for L=2 is approx 133 * 3 = 400. To ensure the backend orders approx 400 units given 3,253 in-transit, mu_hat must be set around 3,653. I will use 'explicit' to force this offset and ensure stock arrives for the current 100-150 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 2,783 units confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Autumn demand for T-shirts has cooled further in October, now averaging ~133 units/period (P28-P35) with a downward trend towards 100 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The T-shirt category has entered a cooling autumn demand regime. Recent demands (P34-P36) are 106, 85, and 84, significantly lower than the previous ~145 average. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward shift, resulting in a base demand estimate of ~112 per period. The pipeline distortion remains severe: 2,783 units are confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Total in-transit is 3,686, meaning roughly 903 units are actually viable. However, the OR backend sees the full 3,686 and will not order unless mu_hat exceeds this pipeline + safety stock. To ensure orders are placed to meet current demand (L+1 = 3 periods, roughly 340 units), I must set mu_hat to approximately (Total In-Transit + Required Stock). I am setting mu_hat via 'explicit' to 4100 (3686 + ~400) to force the backend to bypass the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current lower volatility of the autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand for T-shirts has cooled significantly to ~90-100 units/period (P35-P36 evidence). Pipeline distortion remains at 2,783 units confirmed lost; mu_hat inflation is mandatory to maintain stock levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has settled into an autumn regime of approximately 100 units per period, down from the summer peaks. However, the system is suffering from massive pipeline distortion. There are 4,142 units currently 'in-transit', but history shows that many of these are likely lost or severely delayed (specifically P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, and likely P35-37 given the lack of recent arrivals). To bypass the OR backend's capped base-stock policy which would normally prevent ordering due to high in-transit inventory, I must continue to 'inflate' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to cover the actual forecast (~100 units/period * 3 periods = 300) plus the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of ~4,142 units to ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order. The sigma_hat is set to a standard volatility level (approx 20% of demand) to maintain a buffer for the recent slight uptick in demand (109 units in P37). L is kept at the default promised lead time of 2 as recent successful arrivals (P32, P33) suggest the lead time, when shipments aren't lost, is 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Oct) confirmed at ~100 units/period (P35-37 avg: 92.6). Total pipeline distortion has reached 4,142 units (including 2,783 confirmed lost and significant delays on all orders since P35).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is Nov 4, entering late autumn. Demand for T-shirts has cooled and stabilized at approximately 85-110 units per period (P35-P38 average: 89). Inventory Situation: On-hand is 0. In-transit is significantly inflated at 4,501 units due to historical lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 totaling ~2,865 units) and more recent orders (P35-P38) that are currently within or slightly past the expected lead time but haven't arrived. Since the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline (4,501 units) from the base stock calculation, and our real demand is only ~100 units/period, we must continue to 'inflate' mu_hat to overcome this phantom inventory. To ensure a new order is triggered to meet the actual demand of ~100 units while accounting for the 4,501 units 'blocking' the system, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Pipeline_Distortion. With L=2, (3 * 100) + 4,501 \u2248 4,801. I will set mu_hat slightly higher to ensure the cap doesn't prematurely choke the order, targeting a base stock that results in a net order of ~150-200 units to replenish stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion has reached 4,501 units in P39: this includes 2,865 units confirmed lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) and a sequence of more recent orders (P35-P38) that have yet to arrive. Autumn demand regime (Nov) for T-shirts is stable at ~90 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context: Demand has cooled significantly for this women's T-shirt as we enter mid-November, with the last five periods (P35-P39) averaging 83.4 units. We are currently in Period 40. Pipeline reconciliation: The 'In-transit' figure of 4,415 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 total 2,824 units) and likely lost or severely delayed shipments from earlier periods (P35, P36, P38). However, the arrival of the P37 order (456 units) in P39 provided a necessary buffer, leaving us with 395 units on-hand. Lead time remains erratic (ranging 1-3 periods). I will set L to 2 (promised). To bypass the OR engine's capped policy which would stop ordering due to the 4,415 units 'in-transit', I must continue to inflate mu_hat. I estimate the actual 'living' pipeline is much smaller (~1,000 units). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1,600 (approx 530 units/period for L+1) to ensure the system places a maintenance order despite the phantom inventory, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the lower volatility of the current autumn demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion remains extreme: 2,824 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) are definitively lost. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is approximately 3,500+ units. Late-autumn demand regime (Nov) for T-shirts has stabilized at ~85 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 41 (mid-November). The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt. Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (~500 units/period) to a stable late-autumn regime of approximately 70-80 units/period (P39: 61, P40: 69). The extreme 'In-transit' figure of 4415 units is heavily distorted by long-lost shipments: P3 (268), P7 (382), P12 (630), P17 (958), and P20 (545), totaling 2,783 units that will likely never arrive. Additionally, orders from P35, P36, and P38 (totaling 1,012 units) are significantly overdue. However, P37 arrived in P39, and we currently have 326 units on-hand. With demand at ~70 units, current stock covers ~4 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 4415 units in-transit and blocking all future orders, I must continue to set an explicit mu_hat that offsets the ~2,800 units of definitively lost stock while providing enough buffer for the current demand of ~75 units. I set L=2, and mu_hat = (Lost Units 2,824) + (Current Regime Demand 75 * (1+L)) = 3049. This ensures the system remains 'ready' to order if on-hand drops too low, despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 2,824 units definitively lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Late-autumn demand regime for T-shirts has settled at ~70-80 units/period. Significant delivery delays persist for P35, P36, and P38.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), we are in a late-autumn demand regime for women's t-shirts, with demand stabilizing at a lower level compared to the summer peak. The average demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) is 65.7 units. The pipeline remains extremely distorted with 4,415 units 'in-transit', of which approximately 2,824 units (from P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) are confirmed lost and an additional significant portion (P35, P36, P38) is severely delayed. The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed this phantom inventory. To ensure we have stock for the upcoming weeks given the current on-hand of 259 (roughly 4 weeks of supply at current demand), I will continue to use an explicit mu_hat that offsets the ~2,800 lost units while accounting for the current regime of ~70 units/period. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the volatile history.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (Nov) for T-shirts stabilized at ~70 units/period (P39-P41 avg: 65.7). Delivery delays for P35, P36, and P38 continue to contribute to a total pipeline distortion of over 4,000 units, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2), we are in a low-demand late-autumn/early-winter regime for the 'T-shirt' category, with demand averaging ~80 units over the last 5 periods (P38-P42). The primary challenge is extreme pipeline distortion. There are currently 4,045 units 'In-transit', but historical Carry-Over Insights and arrival data confirm that a significant portion (approx. 2,824 units from P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) are definitively lost. Additionally, recent orders from P35 (220 units), P36 (433 units), and P38 (359 units) are significantly overdue. However, P37 and P39 arrived with lead times of 2 and 3 periods respectively, showing the logistics channel is not completely blocked, just highly unreliable. With 520 units on-hand and demand at ~80/period, we have over 6 weeks of stock. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 4,045 'in-transit' units and refusing to order in the future, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * (current demand + lost units/L) to 'bypass' the phantom inventory. I'll use a conservative L=2 for calculations, but prepare for 47 total periods by maintaining a safety buffer. Sigma is kept slightly higher to account for the erratic arrival of overdue shipments which may cause inventory spikes.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 2,824 units definitively lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). December demand regime for T-shirts remains low, estimated at ~80 units/period. Overdue shipments from P35, P36, and P38 (totaling 1,012 units) are now likely lost or severely delayed, increasing the effective phantom inventory to ~3,836 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the late-autumn/early-winter demand regime for T-shirts. Recent demand (P39-P43) has averaged 73.4 units/period. The pipeline remains significantly distorted by 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20 totaling 2,824 units) and likely lost/severely delayed shipments (P35, P36, P38 totaling 1,012 units). Total confirmed/likely lost units now reach 3,836. Since the current in-transit visibility is 4,045 units, only about 209 units in the pipeline are potentially 'real' and upcoming. With 459 units on-hand and a low demand regime of ~75-80 units, we are currently overstocked relative to immediate needs. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 3,836 lost units as available supply (which would block all future orders), I continue to use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 4,076 (3 periods * 80 units/period + 3,836 lost units) to ensure that once on-hand stock depletes, the system will trigger new orders despite the 'in-transit' volume.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 3,836 units definitively or likely lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, P35, P36, P38). December demand regime for T-shirts is stable at ~75 units/period. mu_hat inflation remains necessary to bypass the backend's pipeline inventory check.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 45, mid-December. The product is a basic jersey T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn/winter low of approximately 65-75 units per period (P42-P44 avg: 75). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 404 units, providing over 5 periods of coverage at current demand rates. The 'In-transit' figure of 4,045 units is highly distorted by historical lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, and likely P35, P36, P38). In P39 and P42, orders from P37 and P39 arrived, indicating that while lead times are volatile (2-3 periods), recent stock is flowing. Because on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending P47) and there is a massive phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a low 'default' or slightly adjusted value to prevent unnecessary ordering, as the goal is to maximize reward by minimizing holding costs on excess stock at the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 3,836 units definitively or likely lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, P35, P36, P38). December demand regime for T-shirts is stable at ~70 units/period. No further orders are required to reach the end of the game (Period 47) given current on-hand inventory of 404 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 47, entering the final two periods of the game. Customer demand for T-shirts has settled into a low winter regime, averaging approximately 71 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). With 340 units currently on-hand, we have more than enough inventory to cover the remaining expected demand for Period 46 and Period 47 (estimated at ~140-160 units total). Any order placed now with the promised lead time of 2 would arrive in Period 48, which is after the game concludes. Even with a lead time of 1, an arrival in Period 47 is unnecessary and would only risk increasing holding costs. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5), the OR backend will calculate a base stock level significantly lower than our current total inventory (on-hand + pipeline), resulting in the desired zero order.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 47, which is the final period of the simulation. The primary objective for this period is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 248 units. Recent demand trends for this T-shirt SKU have shown a significant seasonal decline as winter approaches: the average demand over the last five periods (P42-P46) is approximately 76 units, with the most recent observation being 92 units. Given that the on-hand inventory (248) significantly exceeds the expected demand for the final period, no further orders are required. Furthermore, any order placed now with the promised lead time of 2 periods would not arrive until after the game concludes. The pipeline inventory is also heavily inflated (4,045 units) due to historical lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, etc.), which would naturally suppress any new orders from the OR backend unless mu_hat was extremely inflated. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime.
