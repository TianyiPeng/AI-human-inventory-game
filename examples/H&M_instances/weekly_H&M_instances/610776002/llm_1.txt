Being a 'Everyday Basic' T-shirt, demand is likely to be relatively stable, though it might see a slight uptick as we move into Spring/Summer seasons. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since I start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, I need to cover demand for current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3, P4, P5), totaling 5 periods of demand. Using the historical average of 205 units/period, target inventory is 205 * 5 = 1025 units. Considering the high variability in the historical samples (148 to 308), I will add a small safety buffer. I will order 1200 units to establish the pipeline and prepare for the 4-period lead time wait.",

Historical demand samples averaged around 204 units ([148, 175, 160, 233, 308]); however, Period 1 recorded a demand of 266 units, which is higher than the historical average but consistent with the higher end of the sample. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we lost 266 potential sales in P1. We have 1200 units in-transit from the P1 order. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be available for P6. To calculate our needs: we must cover demand from P2 through P6 (5 periods). Using a conservative demand estimate of ~250 units/period, total need is 1250 units. With 1200 already in-transit, we are slightly under-covered for that horizon. However, since we are currently stock-out and waiting for a large shipment, I will place a smaller order now to adjust the pipeline and start accounting for potential lead-time variability or sustained higher demand.",

There is no immediate spike associated with mid-March, but demand is significantly higher than the initial seed. c) Lead Time: P1 order arrived at the start of P5 (end of P4 resolution), meaning actual lead time is 4 periods (consistent with promise).

Estimated total demand for 5 periods @ 300 units/period = 1500 units. Current pipeline (2148) is significantly higher than 1500. This is because we over-ordered in P1 (1200) relative to current inventory needs.

Projecting an average demand of 420 (capturing recent peaks and seasonality), the target level is 2100. Existing pipeline is 2250, which nominally covers this. However, with 0 on-hand and recent high-volume demand spikes, a safety buffer of 350 units is added to ensure availability for potential peak demand in late May/early June. Order = Target(2100) + Safety(350/Stockout recovery) - Pipeline(2250) + Buffer = 350. This ensures we stay ahead of any sustained shift towards the 500+ unit demand regime seen in P11.",

Period 43 (2019/12/2) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is fundamentally seasonal, peaking in spring/summer and hitting its trough in winter. Current demand (P39-P42) has stabilized between 60-110 units (average ~76), confirming a significant winter baseline shift compared to summer's 400+ units. We are currently in Period 43 (Dec 2), meaning the simulation ends around Period 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 47 resolve or Period 48 start, making it largely irrelevant for the remaining game periods. On-hand inventory is 125 units, and 100 units from Period 39's order are still in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 43 (this period). This will bring total stock to 225. With only approx. 5 periods of play remaining and an average demand of ~76 units/period, the current stock + incoming stock (225 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand (~380 units total) without incurring excessive holding costs, especially since any new order would arrive too late to be sold.",

Period 44 (2019/12/9) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which experiences its peak demand in the spring and summer. We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9), meaning we are in the middle of the low-demand winter season. Recent demand (P39-P43) has averaged approximately 73 units per period (61, 69, 67, 109, 61), which is consistent with the established winter baseline. With 164 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we have enough stock to cover more than 2 periods of demand at the current rate. The game ends in Period 47, meaning only 4 periods of demand remain (P44, P45, P46, P47). Total expected demand for the remainder of the game is approximately 292-300 units (75 units/period * 4). There is a risk of a slight stock-out in the final period if demand spikes, but the holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the proximity to the end of the game (P47) makes over-stocking less attractive. However, since we expect demand for 4 periods and only have 164 units, we should bridge the gap. Given the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed now in P44 will arrive in P48 (after the game ends), making it useless. Therefore, no further orders will impact the game outcome.",

Period 45 (2019/12/16) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a summer basic. Current data (Period 44 Date: 2019/12/09) confirms we are in a low-demand winter period. The demand in the last five periods (P40-P44) has been [69, 67, 109, 61, 55], averaging approximately 72 units. We are at Period 45 out of 47, meaning only 3 periods remain (P45, P46, P47). With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive at the start of Period 50, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to liquidate the current on-hand inventory (109 units) against the remaining demand for Periods 45, 46, and 47. Based on the recent average of 72 units per period, the total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is ~216 units. We have 109 units on hand and 0 in transit. While we are likely to stock out in the final two periods, placing an order now is useless as it will not arrive before the game ends. I will place an order of 0.",

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics), currently in late December (Period 46). Demand has been in a sustained winter baseline regime for the past several weeks. Specifically, from Period 39 to 45, demand has averaged 69 units (ranging from 55 to 109). On-hand inventory is currently 45 units with zero in-transit. Since the total periods are 47, there is only one period remaining after the current decision phase. A lead time of 4 periods means any order placed now (Period 46) would not arrive until Period 50 (Period 46 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion. Therefore, there is no benefit to ordering more units as they cannot be sold within the remaining timeframe, and any excess would simply incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory with no revenue. I will fulfill remaining demand with the existing 45 units on-hand.",

Current demand (Period 46) was 92 units, but we stocked out with an on-hand inventory of 0. Recent demand (P43-P46) has averaged 68 units/period, but Period 46 showed a spike likely due to post-Christmas holiday shopping or preparation for the upcoming warmer months. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), and the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 51 (late January), which is the start of the Spring buildup. Historical data shows demand begins to climb significantly in February (Period 1 demand was 266). With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to restock immediately to cover the 5-period window (P47-P51). Estimating an average demand of ~100 units/period to account for the stock-out and the upcoming seasonal transition, we need approximately 500 units in the pipeline. I will order 500 units to establish a baseline for the early 2020 Spring season.",
