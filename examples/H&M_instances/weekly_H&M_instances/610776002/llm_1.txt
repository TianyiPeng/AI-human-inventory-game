In the retail calendar, mid-February is the transition from winter to spring. Basic T-shirts are year-round staples but often see a demand uptick as layers are shed for spring. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] suggest an average of ~205 units per period with a notable upward trend toward the end. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P3. d) Inventory/Pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Final Order Logic: Since the first arrival won't be available until P3, I need to cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 (L+1 periods). Using a conservative estimate of 200 units per period (based on historical average), I need 600 units to avoid stockouts in the early periods. I will order 650 units to account for the increasing trend seen in the historical samples and to provide a small buffer for the initial replenishment lag.",

Historical samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (mean ~205) suggest P1 was at the higher end. The average of all data points is ~215. (c) Lead time: Promised is 2 periods.

(e) Order logic: I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1=3). Average demand ~215 * 3 = 645. Since I have 650 in transit arriving for P3, I will likely face a stockout in P2 (nothing arriving).

However, realized demand in Periods 1-3 (266, 316, 306) shows a significantly higher regime, averaging ~296. I will use 300 as the baseline demand forecast. c) Lead Time Assessment: Promised lead time is 2. However, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (lead_time = 1). The Period 2 order (250 units) did not arrive in Period 3, meaning lead time is at least 2 for that shipment. I will assume the promised lead time of 2 holds for planning. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 28. In-transit consists of P2 order (250) and P3 order (350), totaling 600. P2 order is expected to arrive in Period 4 (this period), and P3 order in Period 5. e) Order Logic: To cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods (P4, P5, P6) at ~300 units/period, I need ~900 units. Current total inventory (on-hand 28 + in-transit 600) = 628. Deficit = 900 - 628 = 272.

Regarding lead times: P1 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 3 periods, P3 (350 units) is now overdue (ordered P3, now P7 start, 4 periods elapsed), and P4 arrived in 2 periods.

My current on-hand is 50. Expected demand for P7 is ~280. Total pipeline (950) + On-hand (50) = 1000 units. Given that P3 is 2 periods overdue, there's a risk it's lost.

Recent demand has shown a significant regime shift: P11-P12 averaged 494 units, though P13 dipped to 304, likely due to a stockout (on-hand was only 162). Based on the 2019/5/13 date, I expect demand to remain strong, averaging ~450 units. Lead time (L) is erratic, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I must cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Total pipeline needed = 450 * 4 = 1800 units. Current status: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 2050 (Orders from P11, P12, P13). Specifically, P11 (400) and P12 (550) are expected to arrive in P14 or P15. P13 (500) and P14's order will arrive P16 or later. Although In-transit (2050) exceeds the 4-period target (1800), the immediate zero inventory and the risk of a 3-period lead time for the P11/P12 orders necessitate a protective order.

(b) Demand Regime: Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging ~140 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32). (c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Lead times have been highly erratic (1-3 periods). Multiple orders from the peak summer period (P17, P19, P20) are now severely overdue (12+ periods) and must be considered lost. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 2850 units is extremely high, but given the massive delays of orders placed in June/July, most of this pipeline is likely comprised of lost shipments. (e) Final Order Logic: While the pipeline technically exceeds any reasonable forecast, the stockout has persisted since Period 26. I must restart the flow to meet the current stable demand of ~140 units. Since promised lead time is 2 periods and actual can be up to 3, I need to cover ~3-4 periods of demand.

There are only 7 periods remaining in the game (P41-P47). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 3600 units is heavily inflated by lost summer shipments (P17, P19, P20, P21 total 2250 units); however, the recent orders P38 (250 units) and P39 (150 units) are expected to arrive imminently. With demand currently <70 units/period, the 400 units from P38-P39 will sufficiently cover the remaining periods (approx 455 total units needed for P41-P47). Since lead time is volatile (1-3 periods) and the game is ending, I will not place an order this period to avoid excessive holding costs on arriving stock, as the existing pipeline (P38-P39) already covers the vast majority of remaining demand.",

There are only 6 periods remaining in the simulation (P42-P47). The current 'In-transit' figure is 3600 units, but a significant portion of this (2850 units from P17-P20) is almost certainly lost. However, orders from P38 (250 units) and P39 (150 units) are expected to arrive imminently, given that recent lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods. These 400 expected units are more than sufficient to cover the total remaining demand (estimated at ~400 units: 6 periods * ~67 units/period). Ordering more at this stage would only increase the risk of high holding costs at the end of the simulation, especially with on-hand currently at 0 and arrivals pending.

  "rationale": "The demand for this basic jersey top remains in a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand regime, though Period 42 showed a slight uptick to 109 units (potentially due to pre-holiday or Black Friday interest). The average demand over the last four periods (P39-P42) is ~77 units. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units. There is a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 3450 units, though most of these are historically lost shipments from the summer. However, the order from Period 38 (250 units) is now at lead_time=5 and is significantly overdue, suggesting it may be lost. Despite the large theoretical pipeline, only recent orders (P38+) are likely to arrive. Given we are at Period 43 of 47, we only need to cover approximately 4-5 more periods of demand. At an estimated 80-100 units/period, we need ~400-500 units total. With 41 on-hand and 250 units from P38 still theoretically in transit (though likely lost), I will place a conservative order of 200 units to bridge the gap until the end of the game, minimizing holding cost risks given the late stage of the season.",

P43 was ordered last period and is expected to arrive between P45-P46. Given the low demand and the proximity to the end of the game, I will place a small safety order of 100 units to ensure coverage for the final two periods in case P43 is delayed or lost, while avoiding excessive holding costs for the final period (P47).",
