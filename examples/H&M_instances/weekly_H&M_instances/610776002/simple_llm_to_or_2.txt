======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of the provided data [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] shows a clear upward trend in demand over the last 5 periods. The average demand is 204.8, but a significant regime shift occurs between the first three periods (avg ~161) and the most recent two (avg ~271). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is highly relevant as we enter February (Period 1, 2019/2/11). In early February, we typically see a transition toward spring fashion and increased purchasing for 'basics' as shoppers refresh wardrobes. The momentum from 233 to 308 (+32%) suggests a strong ramp-up. For the next period, I anticipate the demand will continue to climb due to this momentum and seasonal relevance, likely stabilizing slightly above the most recent peak.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand data shows a general upward trend [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], followed by a slight drop in the most recent actual observation (Period 1: 266 units). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, which typically sees increasing demand as late winter transitions into spring (February). The date 2019/02/18 is towards the end of February, which often signals the start of spring shopping. Given the historical average of the last five training points (~205) and the recent spike to 308 followed by 266, the demand appears to be stabilizing at a higher level than the early training data. I expect a slight uptick as seasonal demand for light jersey basics builds.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) showed a training set range of 148-308. In the current test phase, demand for Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316) shows a distinct upward trend compared to the early training mean. The current date (2019/2/25) transitions into early spring, a period where basic jersey T-shirts typically see increased demand as consumers begin layering or purchasing for warmer weather. The jump from 266 to 316 (+18.8%) suggests strong momentum. Given the growth trend and seasonal alignment, I expect a continued moderate increase for Period 3.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed a demand range of 148 to 308, ending on an upward trend. Period 1-3 observed demand (266, 316, 306) indicates a demand regime shift compared to the training average, stabilizing at a higher mean of approximately 296 units. The current date (2019/3/4) marks the beginning of March, which typically sees the start of Spring fashion demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' like jersey T-shirts. Period 2 and 3 showed strong, stable performance above 300 units. I expect this higher level of demand to persist as seasonal interest in lightweight basics builds, though with a slight conservative stabilization as the initial early-spring surge levels off.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 1: average demand increased from ~225 in training to ~296 in recent periods (+31%), likely due to seasonal transition to Spring basics.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt, which typically sees increased demand as weather warms in the spring. (1) Historical training demand averaged ~185. (2) Test phase data (Periods 1-4) shows a significantly higher plateau, averaging 292.75 units, confirming a regime shift identified in the previous carry-over insight. (3) Recent demand has stabilized: 316 (P2), 306 (P3), and 283 (P4). While there is a slight week-over-week decline in the last two periods, the volume remains far above historical training levels. (4) For Period 5 (2019/3/11), as March progresses, spring demand for basic jersey tops typically remains strong and stable. I expect the demand to remain within the established 280-310 range, though potentially stabilizing toward the recent average.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training phase (Periods -5 to -1) averaged 205 units. Since Period 1 of the test phase, demand shifted to a higher level, averaging 296 units for Periods 1-4. However, Period 5 (2019/3/11) shows a notable drop to 252 units, which is 11% lower than the previous week and 15% lower than the Period 1-4 average. The date (March 18) marks the transition into mid-Spring; while this is a basic jersey t-shirt, we are seeing a cooling of the initial late-Feb/early-March surge. Given the two consecutive weeks of decline (306 -> 283 -> 252), the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization or continued minor softening as the initial seasonal peak levels off. I predict demand will settle near 245 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt, which is a staple item for spring. Historical training data showed an average of 185 units. However, current test data (Periods 1-6) shows a sustained higher average of 282 units. The demand peaked in Period 2 (316) and has since stabilized in the 250-280 range. The last two periods (Period 5: 252, Period 6: 270) suggest a slight rebound or leveling off. Given the date (March 25), we are in the peak spring shopping season but without a major holiday spike expected for this specific week. Forecast assumes stabilization around the recent mean of the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1045.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 184 units. However, since entering the test phase (February), demand has shifted to a higher level. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~296 units. Recent observations show Period 5 and 6 dipped slightly (252, 270), followed by a significant spike in Period 7 (364 units). The current date is April 1st. April typically marks the beginning of spring shopping for 'Everyday Basics' like this lightweight jersey T-shirt. The jump to 364 suggests the start of a seasonal peak. While Period 7 might be an outlier, the combination of warmer weather and typical early-month shopping behavior supports a continued high demand level. I will forecast a value slightly below the recent spike but significantly above the previous cycle average to account for the seasonal upturn.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Late March/Early April demand surged to 364 units, representing a 20%+ increase over the February/March average of ~284.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt ('Womens Everyday Basics') started with an average of ~165 in the training period and shifted to a higher regime of ~296 during February/early March. The current date (April 8) is peak spring season for basic jersey tops. Recently, there has been a significant surge in demand: Period 7 saw 364 units and Period 8 saw 372 units, confirming the seasonal peak noted in carry-over insights. This upward momentum (nearly 100 units above the early March baseline) suggests sustained high demand for the coming week. Given the back-to-back growth in Periods 7 and 8, I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly increase before stabilizing.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand plateau: Late March through early April demand has stabilized at ~368 units (+24% vs. previous regime), confirming peak season for jersey basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $930.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, a common spring staple. Looking at historical data, demand grew steadily through March, peaking at 372 units in Period 8 (April 1). However, Period 9 (April 8) saw a significant drop to 271 units. This decline suggests that the early April sales peak has passed or was potentially influenced by a specific event (e.g., a promotion or transition period). Period 10 (April 15) is mid-spring; while demand is unlikely to return to the extreme peak of 370+, it should remain higher than the initial February levels (avg ~295). Given the sharp drop in Period 9, the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization or 'mean-reverting' behavior around the current seasonal floor of ~280-300 units.

Carry-over insight: End of early-April peak: Demand fell from 372 to 271 units (-27%) in Period 9, suggesting the initial spring surge has subsided and demand is normalizing to a new mid-season baseline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU (Womens Everyday Basics) showed a significant peak in late March/early April (364-372 units) followed by a sharp correction in Period 9 (271 units). Period 10 (Apr 15) showed a recovery to 310 units. Analyzing the calendar, Period 11 (Apr 22) aligns with the week after Easter 2019 (Apr 21). Typically, demand for basics remains steady or slightly dips after a holiday peak/promotion period as the 'Spring Surge' transitions into a stable mid-season phase. Given the recent bounce-back from 271 to 310, I expect demand to stabilize around the current mid-season average (~295-315). The trend indicates the 'early-April peak' is over, and we are entering a secondary stable regime before summer.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU has shown a baseline around 280-300 units following the initial spring surge. However, Period 11 (2019/4/22) showed a massive spike to 564 units. This aligns with the 'Easter week' (Easter Monday was April 22, 2019), which typically drives significant retail traffic for seasonal basics. Following an holiday peak, demand usually undergoes a correction/drop-down as the immediate shopping incentive fades. While the product is a staple for warmer weather, the extreme spike in Period 11 is likely an outlier caused by holiday promotional activity or a cluster of purchases. I expect demand to revert toward the stabilized 'mid-season baseline' observed in Periods 9-10 (avg ~290), but stay slightly elevated compared to training data as we move into May.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a baseline of ~300 units following the initial spring surge. Period 11 (2019/4/22) saw a massive spike to 564 units, likely driven by Easter Monday and the onset of warmer late-spring weather, making 'Womens Everyday Basics' (jersey T-shirts) highly relevant. Period 12 (424 units) remains elevated compared to the pre-spike baseline but shows a 25% decline from the peak. Period 13 (2019/5/6) follows the UK Early May Bank Holiday weekend (May 6th). While holiday weekends often drive sales, the data suggests a 'cooling off' trend from the extreme late-April peak. I expect demand to follow the downward trajectory from Period 12 but remain above the earlier 300-unit baseline due to seasonal relevance, targeting a level between the previous baseline and the recent high.

Carry-over insight: Late-April surge confirmed: Demand spiked +80% (564 units) in late April, followed by a correction; established a new temporary high-demand range between 400-500 units during prime spring transition.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trend from an initial average of ~290 to a peaked spring range of 300-500. Period 11 saw a major peak (564), followed by a cooling period (424 in P12 and 304 in P13). The current date (May 13) is deep into the spring season for 'Everyday Basics'. The drop from 424 to 304 in the last week suggests the extreme late-April surge has fully normalized. Historically, following a correction after a peak (like Period 9), the demand tends to find a floor or show a slight recovery as it stabilizes into the mid-season baseline. Given the product's high relevance in May, I expect demand to stabilize around the 310-330 range rather than continue a sharp decline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this jersey T-shirt shows high volatility as we move into the peak spring/summer season (May). Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: Period 11 (564), Period 12 (424), Period 13 (304), and Period 14 (431). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 431 units. The date is May 20th, which is a prime period for 'Everyday Basics' like lightweight T-shirts. Period 14 (431 units) indicates a rebound after a dip in Period 13. Given the sustained higher baseline established in May (averaging ~386 across the last 5 periods) compared to march/April, I expect demand to remain strong but stabilize slightly below the most recent spike.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime: Average demand has shifted upwards to ~405 units (+37% vs March/April average of ~295), driven by seasonal interest in lightweight basics.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as the season progresses into late spring. After a volatile April (averaging ~390 units), May (Periods 13-15) has established a higher stable range. Recent demand has climbed steadily over the last two weeks (431 to 442 units). Monitoring the date (May 27), we are entering the peak warm-weather season for 'lightweight jersey' basics. The current trend suggests a continued upward momentum or stabilization at the high end of the current regime established in Period 15 (~405 core average with recent observations at 430-440). I expect demand to remain strong and slightly increase as summer approaches.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:

Demand has stabilized at a high-volume level over the last three periods (P14-P16), with units recorded at 431, 442, and 435 (Average: 436). This follows a late-May surge and confirms a sustained interest in lightweight basics as we enter June. Given the consistency of the recent plateau and the ongoing seasonal relevance of the product, the forecast expects demand to remain around this current mean.

Carry-over insight: June demand stability: Late May/Early June demand has consolidated into a high-volume range between 430-445 units (average 436), establishing a new plateau for the summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU shows a steady climb throughout the spring, peaking significantly as June begins. Demand jumped from a stable range of 430-445 (Periods 14-16) to 640 in Period 17 (2019/6/3), representing a 47% increase. This spike aligns with the onset of peak summer temperatures and June shopping trends for lightweight basics. While Period 17 reached a high of 640, historical behavior following large spikes (e.g., Period 11) suggests a short-term correction or slight regression towards the new, higher mean. However, given the seasonal relevance of a 'lightweight jersey T-shirt' in mid-June, demand is expected to remain significantly elevated compared to May levels. I am forecasting a slight cooling from the peak of 640 but maintaining a high volume consistent with a mid-year seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant June demand surge: Period 17 saw a +47% spike to 640 units compared to the previous 3-week average of 436, indicating the start of the peak summer demand cycle.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as the season progresses into summer. Period 17 saw a significant spike (640 units) which was followed by a correction in Period 18 (419 units). Looking at the Carry-Over Insights, Period 17 was identified as the start of a peak summer demand cycle. The current date (June 17) is mid-June, typically a high-demand period for lightweight jersey basics. While Period 18 dropped to 419, it remains consistent with the baseline established in May/early June (430-445 range). Given the previous spike to 640, a stabilization or slight recovery is expected rather than a further sharp decline, as summer temperatures peak. I will forecast a value reflecting a return toward the high-volume summer plateau observed before the extreme spike.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Tilly' T-shirt has stabilized following the significant surge in Period 17 (640 units). The last two periods (Period 18: 419, Period 19: 439) show a return to the mid-June plateau established between Periods 14-16 (avg ~436). As the date is June 24th, we are deep into the summer peak for lightweight jersey basics. The demand pattern shows that after a massive spike, the floor has risen; the average of the last two periods (429) is very close to the established 'June demand stability' range noted in previous insights (430-445). Given the proximity to late June pay cycles and the height of summer seasonality, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase within this established high-volume plateau.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we entered summer, with a significant plateau established around 430-440 units throughout June (Periods 14-16, 18-19), interrupted by a massive spike in Period 17 (640 units). The most recent observation (Period 20) shows a sharp drop to 301 units. Analyzing the calendar, Period 20 (June 24) precedes the July 4th holiday week in many retail contexts, which often sees a temporary dip in standard sales as consumers focus on specific holiday items or travel, followed by a bounce back. Since the carry-over insights confirm a sustained summer regime average higher than 400 units and the product (lightweight jersey T-shirt) is highly relevant for July weather, the drop in Period 20 is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a permanent regime shift downward. I expect demand to revert toward the established June/July baseline of approximately 420 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt basic) has entered a post-peak downward trend following a high-demand June cycle. Historical demand in the last two periods (Period 20: 301, Period 21: 232) shows a significant contraction (-22% from Period 20 to 21, and -47% from the June average of ~436). This sharp decline reflects the typical seasonality for basic jersey items as mid-summer clearance or transition periods begin, moving away from the peak June surge (640 units). The current average over the last two weeks is 266.5. Given the momentum of the decline, demand is expected to consolidate near or slightly below current levels as it returns to a baseline similar to the Feb/March period (~225-270).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak summer correction: Demand has dropped significantly from a June average of ~436 to a July average of ~266 (-39% reduction), signaling the end of the peak summer demand cycle for basic t-shirts.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which shows high seasonality. Historical data shows a clear peak in June (reaching 640 units), followed by a sharp decline as summer progresses. Since early July (Periods 21 and 22), demand has dropped significantly and stabilized at a much lower range (232 and 238 units). This confirms the 'Post-peak summer correction' noted in the insights, where demand has decreased by ~39% from the June average. Current demand is following a flat trend at this new lower baseline. For Period 23 (July 15), I expect demand to remain stable within this recent 230-240 unit range as the mid-summer lull continues before any potential late-summer or back-to-school shifts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant downward shift since Period 20, as noted in the carry-over insights regarding the post-peak summer correction. The demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basic' t-shirt peaked in early June (640 units) and has since fallen to a new low-demand regime. For the last three periods (Periods 21-23), demand has been tightly clustered at 232, 238, and 212 units, averaging approximately 227 units. This represents a -39% reduction compared to the previous summer plateau. Given the stable but slightly declining trend in the most recent periods (falling from 238 to 212), I expect the demand to remain in this low-200s range as the peak summer buying season concludes and consumers move past July clearance/early summer activity.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand floor: Demand has stabilized at a new low-volume regime of ~227 units (Periods 21-23), down significantly from the June peak, marking the late-summer seasonal trough for basics.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU has entered a clear downward seasonal regime as of July. After the peak summer surge in June (avg ~436), demand dropped significantly starting in Period 20. The last four periods (21-24) show a stable low-volume plateau with demand values of 232, 238, 212, and 207 respectively. This averages approximately 222 units, representing a sustained 'late-summer floor' as identified in the carry-over insights. The most recent two weeks (212 and 207) suggest a slight continuing drift downward as consumers move past the peak season for lightweight jersey basics. Therefore, the forecast for Period 25 (July 29) anticipates a continuation of this stable trough, likely hovering around the 200-210 range.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal cycle for this lightweight T-shirt. After a significant summer peak in June (reaching 640 units), demand has entered a sharp seasonal decline. The latest 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 24 identified a floor around 227 units, but the most recent data (Periods 24 and 25) shows a further drop to 207 and 154 units respectively. This downward trend aligns with the end of the summer season in early August. Period 25 (154 units) represents a -25% week-over-week drop. Given the current date (August 5th), demand is likely approaching the training data levels (avg ~185) as summer clearances end and seasonal relevance for 'lightweight jersey' basics fades. I expect a slight stabilizesation near previous training lows but with continued downward pressure.

Carry-over insight: End of summer decline: August demand has dropped below the previous 'late-summer floor' of 227, reaching 154 units in Period 25, marking a transition back towards base historical levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly (1)' T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as the peak summer season concludes. Historical data shows demand peaked in June (reaching 640 units in Period 17) but has since entered a significant downward trend. In the last five periods (Periods 22-26), demand has plummeted from 238 to 102 units. The most recent period (Period 26, starting Aug 5) saw a drop to 102 units, which is a -33% decrease from the previous week (154 units) and even lower than the original training data average (~185). Given that mid-August typically represents the final clearing of summer basics before fall transitions, I expect demand to continue its decline or stabilize at a very low base level. A slight further decrease is projected as interest shifts away from lightweight jersey basics.

Carry-over insight: August demand collapse confirmed: Demand has broken below the late-summer floor of 227 units, falling to an average of ~128 units over the last two periods (Period 25-26), a -43% decrease from the July average.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt) is currently in a significant seasonal decline following its summer peak. Historical data shows a clear shift: from a June peak (Period 17: 640 units), demand dropped to a July floor (~227 units), and has further collapsed in August. The last three periods (Period 25-27) have recorded 154, 102, and 120 units respectively, establishing a new late-season average of approximately 125 units. This reflects the end-of-season transition for lightweight jersey basics. Period 27 showed a minor stabilization/slight uptick to 120 from 102, suggesting the demand has likely hit its seasonal baseline. For Period 28 (mid-August), I expect demand to remain near this current low-volume plateau as summer clearance ends and consumer focus shifts away from summer basics.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of recent demand shows a significant seasonal decline from summer peaks. Demand reached a trough in Period 26 (102 units) and has since shown a slight upward movement over the last two periods (120 units and 158 units). This suggests the 'August demand collapse' noted in previous carry-over insights has bottomed out. Period 28 (158 units) indicates a recovery towards the historical training average (148-175 range) or early-season base levels. As we move into late August (Period 29: 2019/8/26), we expect a slight continuation of this stabilization or modest recovery as back-to-school or transitional shopping begins, though it remains well below the summer peak. The forecast follows the recent positive trajectory from the 102 units low.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU (610776002) shows a clear seasonal lifecycle. Following a peak in June (Period 17: 640 units), demand entered a sustained decline throughout July and August as the primary summer season ended. The Carry-over Insights correctly identified a demand collapse in August to an average of ~128 units. However, the most recent four periods (Period 26-29) show demand stabilizing in a new low-volume range: 102, 120, 158, and 140 units, averaging 130 units. Period 30 (2019/9/2) marks the start of September; while typically a transition month for school and early fall, this 'Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt likely remains a steady base layer but lacks the strong seasonal tailwinds of spring/summer. Given the stability over the last month (Avg ~130) and the slight upward nudge in the last two weeks compared to the Period 26 low, I expect demand to remain within this established late-summer/early-fall floor.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU has moved through clear seasonal cycles: a high spring/summer regime (Feb-July) and a significant decline starting in late July. Recent demand data (Periods 25-30) shows the product has stabilized at a low-volume baseline. For the last five periods (Periods 26-30), demand has averaged approximately 133 units (range 102-158), reflecting the end of summer basics dominance. The most recent three periods (Period 28: 158, Period 29: 140, Period 30: 145) show a very stable trend around 140-150 units. As we move into the second week of September (Period 31), there are no major cultural or seasonal drivers that would cause a spike in lightweight jersey t-shirts. I expect demand to remain consistent with this established late-season floor.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor: Late August/Early September demand has stabilized in a narrow range between 140-160 units, marking a post-summer baseline that is ~68% lower than the June peak.

LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) experienced peak demand in June (~640 units) and has since undergone a significant seasonal correction. Following a sharp decline through August, demand has entered a stable 'September demand floor' as highlighted in the carry-over insights. For the last four periods (Periods 28-31), demand has been very stable, ranging between 140 and 158 units (mean: 146). The current date is mid-September, a time when apparel demand for summer basics typically remains at a steady low baseline before any potential shift toward fall/winter layering or clearance activities in much later periods. Given the high consistency of the last three weeks (140, 145, 141), I expect demand to remain within this narrow floor range.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) has exhibited a clear seasonal life-cycle. Following a high-demand peak in June (reaching 640 units), demand plummeted throughout July and August as the summer season concluded. Over the last five periods (Period 28 to 32), demand has entered a stable plateau phase, fluctuating narrowly between 135 and 158 units (Average: 143.8). The most recent three periods (30, 31, 32) show a very slight tightening range: 145, 141, 135. Given the current date is late September (2019/09/23) and the product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, we are in a low-demand off-season for this specific basic. There is no evidence of a Fall resurgence yet; instead, the data shows a gentle drift towards the lower end of the current 135-145 range.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) experienced a major peak in June (~436-640 units) and a subsequent decline through July and August. In September (Periods 30-33), demand stabilized significantly into a consistent low-volume regime. Specifically, the last four periods recorded 145, 141, 135, and 147 units respectively. This indicates a high level of stability around an average of 142 units. As of Sept 30, we are entering October; while typically a transition to cooler weather, the current trend for this basic item is extremely flat. There is no evidence yet of a secondary peak or further decline, so the most probable outcome is a continuation of the 140-145 unit baseline established over the last month.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 610776 (Tilly T-shirt) shows a clear shift into the autumn season. Following the June peak (~436 units) and the July/August decline, demand stabilized in September between 135-160 units (average ~142). However, Period 34 (2019/9/30) saw a significant drop to 106 units, its lowest level since August. As we enter October (Period 35), seasonal transitions for lightweight jersey basics often face further downward pressure in the Northern Hemisphere as consumers pivot to heavier layers. Given the recent drop to 106 and the general downward seasonal trend, I expect demand to remain near this new lower support level or slightly lower.

Carry-over insight: October transition: Early October demand (Period 34) has dropped to 106 units, breaking below the September floor of 140-160 units (-25% decrease), signaling the start of a late-autumn cooling period for lightweight basics.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal decline for this product ('T-shirt in lightweight jersey'). Demand peaked in June (up to 640 units) and has been on a sustained downward trend since summer ended. Recent periods (34 and 35) show a break below the previous September floor of ~140-160 units, dropping to 106 and then 85 units respectively. As we move into mid-October (Period 36, Oct 14th), cooler weather typically reduces demand for lightweight basics in the Northern Hemisphere. Historically, the training data started at 148, but the current test data reflects a deeper low. Given the consecutive drops of ~28% (P33 to P34) and ~20% (P34 to P35), demand is expected to either stabilize at this new low or continue a slight seasonal decline as we enter late autumn.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn demand floor confirmed: Mid-October demand has dropped below 100 units, establishing a new seasonal low of ~85 units, a -45% decrease from the September baseline of ~145.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Lightweight Jersey T-shirt) is currently in a late-autumn seasonal decline. Demand has consistently dropped from a September baseline of ~145 units to an October low. Over the last three periods (34, 35, and 36), demand has fallen from 106 to 85, and then stabilized at 84. This indicates that we have likely hit a seasonal floor for this basic lightweight item as cooler weather sets in. Given the stability shown between Period 35 (85 units) and Period 36 (84 units), the forecast for Period 37 (Oct 21) predicts continued stability at this new low-demand floor before any potential late-year holiday shifts.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this lightweight jersey t-shirt. After a peak in June (640 units), demand declined through summer and stabilized in September around 145 units. As of October, demand has entered a 'late-autumn cooling period' (as noted in Carry-over Insights), with the most recent three periods recording 85, 84, and 109 units. The slight uptick from 84 to 109 in the most recent period (Period 37) suggests a temporary variance rather than a trend reversal, as the product (lightweight basic) is seasonally disadvantaged in late October. Given the stabilized floor established in mid-October (averaging ~93 units over the last three periods), the forecast for Period 38 (late October) anticipates demand will remain within this low-volume floor, settling slightly lower than the recent spike as the season transitions fully into winter.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Following a peak in June (640 units), demand has steadily declined through summer and autumn. Recent periods (P35-P38) have established a late-autumn floor, with demands of 85, 84, 109, and 78 respectively. The average over these last four weeks is 89 units. As we enter November, the demand for lightweight basics is expected to remain at this low seasonal baseline. The slight uptick in P37 (109) appears to be a minor fluctuation rather than a trend reversal. Therefore, the forecast for P39 aligns with the recently established floor of approximately 85 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, a lightweight jersey T-shirt, is currently in its seasonal low-demand period as we move into November. Historical demand shows a consistent decline through October, with Period 39 reaching a new low of 61 units. While there was a slight temporary bump in Period 37 (109 units), the overall trend is downward, reflecting the decreasing relevance of lightweight basics in late autumn. Given the recent drop from 78 to 61 units, I expect demand to stabilize around this new seasonal floor during mid-November before any potential holiday impact.

Carry-over insight: Early November demand floor: Demand has further declined below the mid-October floor of 85 units, reaching an average of ~70 units (Periods 38-39), representing a -50% decrease from the September baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear downward trajectory as we move into late autumn. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is counter-seasonal for November. The carry-over insight for Period 40 identified a new early November demand floor of approximately 70 units based on the most recent observations. Over the last three periods (38-40), demand has been 78, 61, and 69, averaging 69.3 units. As we are now in mid-to-late November (2019/11/18), demand is expected to remain at this low-volume floor or slightly decline further as winter approaches. Given the stability around the 61-78 range over the last few weeks, the forecast maintains the current baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this basic jersey T-shirt shows a clear downward seasonal trend as we move into late autumn/winter. After peaking in June at 640 units, demand has steadily declined. We have established a recent 'Early November demand floor' (Periods 38-41) where demand has stabilized in a very low range of 61-78 units, with an average of approximately 69 units over the last four periods. Period 41 demand was 67 units, showing high stability within this low-volume regime. While the current date (2019/11/25) is the week of Black Friday, this specific product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt in lightweight jersey, which is seasonally out of favor for winter. Given the consistent floor observed over the last month, a forecast sticking closely to the recent 4-week mean is most appropriate, as there is no evidence of a pre-holiday spike for this summer-oriented basic.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight t-shirt shows a clear seasonal lifecycle: a strong spring/summer peak followed by a steady decline through autumn. By Period 40, demand reached a seasonal floor of approximately 60-70 units. However, Period 42 (Nov 25) shows a notable uptick to 109 units (a +63% increase over the previous week). This spike aligns with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail event which occurred on November 29 and December 2, 2019. Period 43 (Dec 2) includes Cyber Monday and the immediate post-Black Friday weekend, which typically sees sustained promotional traffic. While the 'Cyber' effect is strong, the product is a lightweight summer basic, limiting its maximum winter upside compared to winter-appropriate categories. I expect demand to remain elevated due to the holiday shopping tail and Cyber Monday before beginning a late-December taper.

Carry-over insight: Holiday shopping spike: Late November (Period 42) demand increased by ~63% (from 67 to 109 units), signaling a temporary breakout from the autumn basement regime due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions.

Predicted demand: 115 units

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is currently in its seasonal trough, having declined steadily throughout autumn. Period 42 saw a brief 63% spike (109 units) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but Period 43 immediately reverted to 61 units, confirming the temporary nature of that surge. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to remain near the established late-autumn/early-winter baseline. While December generally sees increased retail traffic, this specific lightweight product category typically remains flat at its floor until the spring transition. I expect demand to hover around the 65-70 unit range, regressing slightly from the low of 61 toward the previous baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle for this lightweight basic t-shirt, with demand peaking in summer and declining through autumn. After a temporary holiday promotion spike in Period 42 (109 units), demand has corrected back to the late-autumn basement regime, falling to 61 and then 55 units in Periods 43 and 44 respectively. Mid-to-late December typically sees the absolute seasonal trough for lightweight jersey basics as consumer interest shifts entirely to winter wear and specific holiday gifting. Given the recent downward trend from 61 to 55, I anticipate demand will stabilize near this floor for the week of December 16th.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis for Period 46 (2019/12/23) shows the product is currently in its off-season winter trough, with recent demand for the last three periods (43, 44, 45) averaging approximately 60 units (61, 55, 64). However, the current period covers Christmas and the start of post-Christmas 'Boxing Day' clearance sales. Based on the behavior during the previous holiday retail event (Period 42 - Black Friday), where demand spiked by ~63% over the baseline (from 67 to 109 units), a similar seasonal lift is expected. While a lightweight T-shirt is not a primary winter item, it is a high-velocity 'Everyday Basic' frequently included in end-of-year clearance bundles or bought with gift cards. I anticipate a bump from the ~60 unit floor to approximately 85-90 units, reflecting the beginning of the post-holiday sales surge but remaining lower than the Black Friday peak due to deeper winter context.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a clear primary seasonal peak in June (up to 640 units) and a significant decline throughout autumn, reaching a floor of approximately 60-70 units in November and December. Recently, Period 42 showed a promotional spike (109 units) followed by a correction. Period 46 (Dec 23-29) saw a holiday-related increase to 92 units from the previous baseline of ~64. Period 47 (Dec 30-Jan 5) covers the New Year period, which typically maintains some elevated traffic due to holiday sales and gift card redemptions before the deep winter trough in January. I expect demand to moderate slightly from the Christmas peak but remain above the early-December basement.
