Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last 5 periods shows a clear and sustained upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is 2019/2/11. This is a basic jersey T-shirt for women. February marks the beginning of the spring transition in retail, where demand for layering basics typically increases. 3. Trend Analysis: The demand has grown significantly, nearly doubling over the last 5 periods. The most recent jump from 233 to 308 (a 32% increase) suggests strong momentum. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the upward trend and the transition into spring/pre-summer season for a basic T-shirt, I expect the demand to continue growing, though perhaps at a slightly more moderate rate as it stabilizes at a new level.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend confirmed: demand increased from an average of ~160 in early periods to over 300 in the most recent period (+90% growth over 5 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (Periods -4 to 0) showed a strong upward trend, rising from 148 to 308. However, the most recent observation (Period 1, 2019/02/11) shows 266 units, which is a decrease from the peak of 308 but still significantly higher than the early average of ~160. This suggests the rapid growth phase is stabilizing. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is entering the spring season in February, typically seeing steady demand. Given the slight cooling from the peak (308 down to 266), the forecast expects a moderate level consistent with the new established baseline above 250.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an upward trend ending at 308. In the test phase, Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316) confirm that demand is sustaining at this higher level, with an average of 291 over the last two weeks. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees increasing demand as late February approaches spring. Given the jump from 266 to 316 and the previous high of 308, the demand is currently in a high-volume regime. I expect demand to remain strong or slightly increase as the spring season nears, following the established upward trajectory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data showed a strong upward trend from 148 to 308. In the test phase, demand has stabilized around a high mean, with the last three observations being 266, 316, and 306 (average: 296). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. As a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, demand typically increases moving into Spring. There are no major immediate retail holidays in early March, but general seasonal transition supports sustained volume. 3. Trend Analysis: The rapid growth seen in the training period has leveled off into a high-demand regime. The variance between 266 and 316 suggests some volatility around the ~300 mark. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the stability over the last two weeks (316, 306), I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent high-level performance, slightly adjusted for the ongoing Spring transition.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an initial growth phase (148 to 308). In the current test phase (Periods 1-4), the demand has stabilized at a higher level with a mean of approximately 293 units. Specifically, demand peaked at 316 in Period 2 and has shown a slight cooling trend over the last two weeks (306 to 283). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' lightweight T-shirt; as we move further into March (current date 2019/3/11), demand is expected to remain robust due to spring seasonality. Given the slight recent decline from the peak but the overall high baseline compared to the training set, I expect demand to stabilize near the current moving average.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data ended with a strong upward trend, reaching 308. Test data initially peaked at 316 in Period 2. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: March 18 marks the transition into Spring, which typically supports demand for 'Everyday Basics' like jersey T-shirts. 3. Recent Trend: After the peak in Period 2 (316), demand has declined for three consecutive periods (306, 283, 252), suggesting a correction from the initial surge. The decline between P4 and P5 was 31 units (~11%). 4. Forecast Logic: Given the consistent three-period downward trend despite the approaching spring season, the forecast anticipates a continued but moderating decrease, projecting a value near 225 based on recent momentum.

Carry-over insight: Trend reversal/correction: Following the peak of 316 in Period 2, demand has declined for 3 consecutive periods (average weekly drop of ~21 units), stabilizing the demand mean around 280.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an initial growth phase (148 to 308). In the test phase, demand peaked at Period 2 (316 units) and then entered a corrective phase. Over the last four periods (Periods 3-6), demand has averaged approximately 278 units (306, 283, 252, 270). The slight uptick from 252 to 270 in the most recent period suggests the downward trend has stabilized. Given that the current date (March 25) is entering early spring, a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt is expected to maintain steady or slightly increasing demand as weather warms. I am forecasting a slight increase from the previous period, aligning with the stabilized mean of the recent four-week window.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt showed a peak in Period 2 (316), followed by a steady decline to 252 in Period 5. Period 6 saw a slight recovery (270), and Period 7 showed a massive spike to 364 (+35% WoW). This spike aligns with late March/early April, a period where demand for 'Everyday Basics' like jersey T-shirts typically surges due to spring seasonal transitions and pre-Easter shopping. While the Carry-over insight suggested a stabilization around 280, the most recent data point indicates a new upward momentum. Given the seasonal relevance of the product in April, I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly regress from the peak of 364 as the initial spring surge plateaus.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows an initial peak in Period 2 (316) followed by a gradual decline to a low of 252 in Period 5. However, since Period 6, there has been a significant and sustained surge in demand. Period 7 (364) and Period 8 (372) represent a new demand level significantly higher than the previous average. This aligns with the seasonal transition into spring (April) for a lightweight 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, as warmer weather typically drives demand for such items. Given the upward momentum and the start of the spring retail season, I expect demand to remain strong and potentially increase slightly or plateau at this higher level.

Carry-over insight: New seasonal upward shift confirmed: Average demand increased from 270 (Periods 4-6) to 368 (Periods 7-8), a ~36% increase coinciding with the transition into spring.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt showed a significant jump in Period 7 and 8 (averaging 368 units), likely due to a spring seasonal surge. However, Period 9 saw a sharp drop to 271 units, returning demand to levels seen in Periods 4-6. The current date (2019/04/15) is the week before Easter, which typically sees a stabilization or slight lift in retail demand for basics, but the immediate preceding drop suggests the initial spring peak has subsided. I will forecast a slight recovery towards the recent mean, anticipating demand around 285 units as the market stabilizes post-peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an upward shift starting in Period 7 (averaging ~368 in P7-P8) followed by a cooling off in Period 9 (271). Period 10 (310) shows a recovery as we move deeper into the spring season (late April). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has high seasonal relevance during this transition to warmer weather. The date (2019/4/22) is the week following Easter 2019 (April 21), which often sees a slight normalization or minor dip in retail traffic, but the overall spring trend remains strong. Given the rebound from P9 to P10 and the product's seasonal profile, demand is expected to remain robust but slightly stabilize around the recent three-period mean (~297).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a general upward trend as spring progresses, with a significant spike in Period 11 (564 units). The previous average (Periods 7-10) was approximately 329 units. The jump to 564 (+82% from Period 10) likely corresponds to the Easter holiday (April 21, 2019) and the transition into warmer late-April weather. For Period 12 (April 29), I anticipate a post-holiday correction, though demand should remain higher than the pre-spike average due to seasonality for 'Jersey Basics' in spring. I expect demand to settle between the spike and the previous mean.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 11 (564 units) attributed to Easter holiday/spring seasonality, representing an 82% increase over the previous week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an upward shift starting around Period 7 (averaging ~368). The product is a basic lightweight T-shirt, which sees high relevance as spring progresses into May. Recent data shows a massive spike in Period 11 (564) followed by a high but lower Period 12 (424). The Period 11 spike was likely driven by the Easter holiday (April 21) and the start of warmer weather. While demand is correcting from the holiday peak, Period 12 remains significantly higher than the pre-holiday average (approx. 320), suggesting a sustained seasonal baseline for May. Given the 'everyday basic' nature of the product and the date (May 6), I expect demand to continue normalizing downward toward the high-300s level as the holiday effect fades, but staying above the early April baseline due to rising temperatures.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a significant peak in Period 11 (564 units) coinciding with Easter, followed by a post-holiday correction. Demand has decreased for two consecutive periods (424 to 304). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which remains highly relevant as we enter mid-May (warmer weather). Current demand (304) has returned to the pre-Easter baseline level (Period 10 was 310). Considering the downward momentum from the peak but the seasonal relevance of a basic T-shirt in May, I expect demand to stabilize or show a slight seasonal uptick compared to the non-holiday baseline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows high volatility with a strong upward trend during the spring months. Period 11 (Easter) saw a major peak (564), followed by a correction (Period 13: 304). Period 14 saw a significant rebound to 431 units, likely driven by the transition into warmer weather in mid-May. The current date is May 20th, coinciding with the approach of Memorial Day (US) or late-spring shopping in Europe/UK, which typically sustains demand for basics like jersey T-shirts. Averaging the last three periods (Period 12-14) gives 386 units, while the recent rebound suggests momentum is staying high as summer approaches.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-level volatility: Post-Easter demand has settled into a higher range (average 386 units in Periods 12-14) compared to the pre-spike average of 310 units, indicating a permanent seasonal lift as the weather warms.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a transition from a baseline of ~300 in the early spring to a higher plateau in May. Recent demand (Periods 14-15) has stabilized at high levels (431 and 442 units respectively) as we enter late May. The current date is 2019/05/27, which corresponds to the week following a warm-up period and precedes the start of June. For a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt, this timing aligns with peak summer seasonality. The average of the last four periods (excluding the Easter outlier) is approximately 400. Given the upward momentum from 431 to 442 and the seasonal relevance of the product in late May, I anticipate demand to remain strong and slightly increase.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed: Post-Easter demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~400 units (Periods 12-15), representing a 30% increase over the early spring average of ~310.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear transition from a spring average demand of ~310 to a significantly higher plateau following the Easter spike (Period 11). For the last three consecutive weeks (Periods 14-16), demand has stabilized with very low variance: 431, 442, and 435 (mean of 436). As of June 3rd, the product\u2014a lightweight jersey basic T-shirt\u2014is in peak seasonal relevance for the early summer season. Given the stability of the recent demand plateau and the lack of immediate calendar-driven outliers for this week, the forecast maintains the current established mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic t-shirt has shown a significant upward trend as we move into summer. After stabilizing at a plateau of ~400 units (Periods 12-15), demand jumped to 435 in Period 16 and surged to 640 units in Period 17 (June 3). The current date (June 10) falls within the peak summer shopping season for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. While Period 17's 640 units is a sharp spike, the preceding periods show a sustained high-demand environment (avg ~430). The jump in Period 17 likely represents the onset of mid-year sales or peak summer weather, but a slight cooling or stabilization is expected after such a massive spike.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand surge: Period 17 demand (640 units) represents a ~50% increase over the previous 4-week plateau, indicating a new seasonal peak phase.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear seasonal progression from a baseline of ~300 in February/March to a plateau of ~400 in May. Period 17 (June 3) saw a massive peak of 640 units, which appears to be a seasonal surge (early summer peak). Period 18 saw a correction back to 419 units. Given the date (June 17), we are in the peak of summer shopping. The previous 5 periods (14-18) average 474 units. The drop from 640 to 419 suggests the initial 'surge' has passed, but demand remains high compared to the May average of 400. I expect demand to remain stable around the current plateau as the summer season continues.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic T-shirt has stabilized into a high-level plateau following the Easter seasonal shift. Excluding the significant spike in Period 17 (640 units), which appears to be a transient outlier possibly due to a promotion or specific weather event, the demand has returned to its established baseline. Over the last two periods (419 and 439), demand has aligned closely with the previous plateau average of ~435 units observed in Periods 14-16. Given the current date of June 24th (peak summer season), demand for 'Everyday Basics' T-shirts is expected to remain firm and stable at this elevated level without immediate signs of further surges or declines.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a progression from a baseline of ~280 units (Periods 1-6) to a spring plateau of ~400-440 units (Periods 12-16, excluding the Easter spike). Period 17 saw a summer peak of 640, followed by two weeks of sustained high demand (~430). Period 20 shows a significant drop to 301 units. While July (Period 21) is peak summer and should support demand for basic T-shirts, the sharp decline in Period 20 suggests a cooling off from the June peak or a temporary fluctuation. I expect demand to recover slightly from the Period 20 low but remain below the June average, stabilizing around the 350-380 range as mid-summer shopping continues.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has entered a significant downward trend following the early summer peak. After a seasonal high of 640 in Period 17 and a brief plateau around 430 (Periods 18-19), demand dropped sharply to 301 (Period 20) and 232 (Period 21). This represents a decline of approximately 47% from the June average. As of early July, the product is likely experiencing a post-peak summer slowdown or a shift in consumer focus away from early-season basics. Given the momentum of the last two weeks (declines of 31% and 23% respectively), I expect demand to continue softening or stabilize at a lower mid-summer floor. I am forecasting a slight further decrease to 215, reflecting a deceleration of the recent sharp drop.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand correction confirmed: Demand has fallen for two consecutive periods (dropping from 439 to 232), breaking below the previously established spring/summer plateau of ~400 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt peaked in early June (Period 17: 640 units) but has since undergone a significant mid-summer correction. Over the last five periods, demand dropped from the 400s to a much lower level, with the most recent two weeks (Periods 21 and 22) showing stability at 232 and 238 units respectively. This suggests a new mid-summer demand floor has been established. For Period 23 (mid-July), there are no major retail drivers to suggest a rebound; typically, basic jersey sales remain flat or continue a slight decline as the summer season matures and consumers wait for late-summer clearances or autumn arrivals. Therefore, I predict demand will remain consistent with the recent stabilization seen in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor confirmed at Period 22: After the mid-summer correction, demand has stabilized at a mean of ~235 units, approximately 42% lower than the early summer plateau of ~407.

Predicted demand: 236 units

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU has transitioned from a high early-summer peak (Period 17: 640 units) into a significantly lower mid-summer plateau. Over the last three periods (21-23), demand has stabilized at a new floor, recording 232, 238, and 212 units respectively. This represents a mean of approximately 227 units. As we are in late July (2019/7/22), the seasonal demand for lightweight jersey T-shirts typically remains steady at these lower levels before any potential late-summer or back-to-school shifts. Given the slight downward movement in the most recent observation (212), the forecast anticipates the demand will remain near this established floor.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal peak in June (Period 17: 640 units) followed by a sharp correction in July. The demand has transitioned from an early summer plateau of ~400 units to a new mid-summer floor. Over the last four periods (21-24), demand has stabilized in the low 200s (232, 238, 212, 207), averaging approximately 222 units. Given the late July date (2019/07/29), the peak summer shopping period has passed, and demand for this basic T-shirt is expected to remain consistent with this recent lower-level stability as the season begins to transition. The forecast weights the most recent two weeks (avg ~210) slightly more than the four-week average to account for the minor continuing downward drift.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant downward shift as the season moves into late summer. After a mid-summer plateau around 235 units (Periods 21-24), Period 25 saw a sharp drop to 154 units (-35% from the previous 4-week average). This aligns with a retail transition out of peak summer 'Everyday Basics' toward autumn inventory. For Period 26 (August 5), demand is expected to remain at this lower level or continue a slight decline, as the lightweight jersey material loses seasonal relevance. I am forecasting a stabilization near the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor shift at Period 25: demand dropped from the previous support level of ~235 to 154, indicating a late-summer seasonal decline as the product enters the end-of-season phase.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear end-of-season decline. Following a mid-summer stabilization around 220 units (Periods 21-24), demand has dropped sharply for two consecutive weeks: 154 units in Period 25 (-25%) and 102 units in Period 26 (-34%). As of August 12th, the product is entering the late-summer/pre-fall transition where demand for basic lightweight summer apparel typically reaches its lowest point. Given the consistent downward velocity of ~30% over the last two observations, I expect the demand to continue its descent toward a residual baseline.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline intensified: Demand has dropped for 3 consecutive periods (207 to 102), losing approximately 50% of its volume and establishing a new low-demand regime below 110 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, a lightweight jersey T-shirt, is currently in an end-of-season decline phase typical for late August. Historical demand peaked in early summer (Period 17: 640 units) and has since followed a sharp downward trajectory as the season transitions. Over the last five periods, demand has dropped from 212 to 120. Specifically, Period 26 (102) and Period 27 (120) indicate the demand has entered a new low-level regime below 125 units. While Period 27 showed a minor uptick from Period 26, the overall seasonal trend remains bearish. Given the date (August 19), demand is expected to stabilize at this lower baseline rather than recover, as retail focus shifts toward autumn collections. I am forecasting a slight stabilization around the 115-unit mark.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt) reached its seasonal low in Period 26 (102 units) following an end-of-summer decline. Since then, there has been a consistent three-period recovery: 102 to 120 (+17.6%) and then to 158 (+31.6%). This upward momentum coincides with late August (2019/08/26), which typically correlates with 'Back-to-School' shopping for everyday basics like jersey T-shirts. Given the accelerating growth in the last two weeks, I expect a continued increase as this seasonal demand peaks, though at a slightly moderated pace to remain conservative.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer recovery confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P26-P28), rising from 102 to 158 units (+55% total growth) as the product enters the back-to-school shopping phase.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt reached a seasonal low in Period 26 (102 units) but has since shown a 'back-to-school' recovery, averaging approximately 139 units over the last three periods (P27-P29). The current date is September 2nd, which typically marks the end of the peak summer/back-to-school shopping season. Although demand slightly dipped from Period 28 (158 units) to Period 29 (140 units), it remains significantly above the late-summer floor. For Period 30, I anticipate demand to stabilize near the current three-week mean as the product transitions from summer peak to early autumn baseline demand for basics.

Historical data shows a significant decline from early summer peaks, reaching a low of 102 units in Period 26. Since then, the product experienced a minor 'back-to-school' recovery, peaking at 158 in Period 28, before stabilizing over the last two weeks (140 units in Period 29 and 145 units in Period 30). For the current period (September 9th), demand is expected to remain in this stable plateau as the season transitions from late summer into early autumn. The T-shirt, being an everyday basic, serves as a layering piece during this transition, supporting a steady demand mean around the 140-145 range.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lightweight basic T-shirt peaked in early summer (Period 17: 640 units) and declined sharply through July and August. After reaching a low of 102 (Period 26), demand saw a brief recovery to 158 (Period 28), likely driven by back-to-school shopping. Over the last three periods (P29-P31), demand has stabilized significantly, recording 140, 145, and 141 units respectively. This indicates a new autumn plateau with a mean of ~142 units. As we move further into September, there are no immediate seasonal catalysts to suggest a breakout from this range, and the product's 'lightweight' nature may lead to a very gradual tapering as weather cools, though 'everyday basics' typically maintain a steady baseline. Therefore, the forecast remains consistent with the recent three-week average.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed: Following the late-summer recovery, demand has stabilized over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) at a mean of 142 units, ending the previous upward trend.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic T-shirt has entered a period of stability following the late-summer recovery. Over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand has hovered consistently around a mean of 140 units (140, 145, 141, 135). The most recent observation of 135 units reflects a minor 4% decrease from the previous week but remains within the established plateau range. As we are in late September, the 'Back to School' peak has passed and the product is transitioning into a steady autumn baseline for basic jersey layers. Given the lack of major calendar events or significant trend shifts in the last 4 weeks, the forecast expects demand to remain near the current plateau average.

The demand for this basic T-shirt has entered a very stable plateau following the late-summer recovery.

This stability suggests that the 'back-to-school' recovery has settled into a baseline autumn demand level for this category. As the current date (September 30) transitions into October without any major immediate retail catalysts, I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent five-week average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has transitioned from a stable late-summer plateau (Periods 29-33) averaging approximately 142 units into a potential autumn decline. Period 34 showed a significant drop to 106 units, which is 25% below the previous 5-week mean and the lowest volume since the mid-August trough (Period 26). Given the date (early October) and the product's category as a lightweight jersey basic, demand is expected to face seasonal downward pressure as temperatures drop. The forecast for Period 35 anticipates demand to remain near this lower level (105-115 units), reflecting the shift away from T-shirt seasonality while acknowledging the baseline demand for everyday basics.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees declining demand in the Northern Hemisphere during October as temperatures drop. Analysis of recent demand shows a clear breakdown from the previous plateau of ~142 units (P29-P31). Specifically, demand has dropped for two consecutive weeks, falling from 147 (P33) to 106 (P34) and then to 85 (P35). This represents a 28% and 20% week-over-week decline respectively. Given the seasonal transition into mid-October, demand is expected to continue its downward trajectory towards a winter floor, though the rate of decline may begin to decelerate as it approaches a minimum baseline for 'Everyday Basics'.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Tilly T-shirt, a lightweight basic jersey item, follows a clear seasonal pattern with peaks in late spring/early summer and a significant decline as the weather cools. Following a late-summer stabilization around 142 units (Periods 29-33), demand has entered a new downward shift. The last three periods (P34-P36) have seen demand drop from 106 to 85 and 84 units, respectively. This decline coincides with the transition into late October, where demand for lightweight basics typically bottoms out before any potential holiday or winter layering spikes. Given the stability between P35 and P36, the demand appears to have found a new lower support level around 85 units. I expect Period 37 to remain consistent with this new low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor confirmed at Period 36: Following the autumn plateau of ~140, demand has shifted downward to a new seasonal baseline of ~85 units (a 40% decrease) as of mid-October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (a basic jersey T-shirt) has entered a late-autumn low-demand regime. Following a plateau of ~140 units in September, demand shifted downward in October to a new floor, with Period 35 and 36 recording 85 and 84 units respectively. While Period 37 showed a slight uptick to 109 units, this remains within the expected volatility of the current seasonal baseline (~85-110 units). Given the product category (Everyday Basics), demand is expected to remain stable at this lower level as the weather cools, with no major retail triggers occurring in late October for this specific item. The forecast weights the recent floor of ~85 and the slight recovery in P37 to arrive at a value near the recent average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal transition from an early autumn plateau of ~140 units (Periods 29-33) to a lower late-autumn baseline. Over the last four periods (P35-P38), demand has averaged approximately 89 units (85, 84, 109, 78), confirming the floor established in the previous carry-over insight. As we enter early November, a lightweight jersey T-shirt is in its seasonal low-point before any potential holiday spikes. Given the most recent observation of 78 and the 4-week average of 89, the forecast anticipates demand will remain stable within this lower regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into the winter months. Recent demand has dropped from a mid-October average of ~90 units to 78 units (P38) and 61 units (P39). While the current week (Nov 11) coincides with Singles' Day and the start of pre-Black Friday retail activity, which could provide a minor promotional lift for basic items, the underlying seasonal trend for a 'lightweight jersey' product is strongly downward. I expect demand to stabilize slightly or decline more slowly than the previous week's 22% drop due to these calendar effects, positioning the forecast near the 60-65 range.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand decay: Demand has fallen for two consecutive periods (78 to 61), indicating a further seasonal contraction from the previous baseline of ~85 units to a new range near 60-70 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal transition for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand peaked in late spring/early summer (reaching 640 units) and has steadily declined through autumn. Recent periods (P38-P40) indicate a late-autumn baseline shift with demand settling between 60 and 80 units (78, 61, 69). The current date (Nov 18, 2019) is one week prior to the Black Friday promotional window. Typically, demand for basics remains low or slightly contracts in the week immediately preceding major sales as consumers delay purchases. Given the recent average of ~69 units over the last three periods and the lack of immediate seasonal drivers for a lightweight top in late November, the forecast projects demand to remain within the established low-regime range of 60-75 units before any potential holiday spike.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has entered a late-autumn seasonal low, consistent with its category as a lightweight jersey basic. Historical data from the last three periods (P39-P41) shows a stabilized demand plateau with values of 61, 69, and 67, establishing a mean of approximately 66 units. This follows a significant decline from the mid-October baseline of ~85 units. Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with the week of Black Friday. While this SKU is a basic item, major retail events typically provide a minor lift even to non-seasonal staples. However, the overall trend remains bearish. I expect demand to remain within the current established range (60-70) with a slight uptick due to Black Friday promotional activity.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed: Since Period 39, demand has stabilized at a late-autumn floor of ~66 units, representing a further 22% decrease from the mid-October baseline of 85.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical demand reached a late-autumn floor of approximately 66 units between Periods 39-41. However, Period 42 saw a significant 63% increase to 109 units, coinciding with the lead-up to Black Friday. The current period (Period 43, starting Dec 2) includes Cyber Monday and the first full week of December holiday shopping. For a basic jersey T-shirt, this seasonal transition typically sustains higher traffic compared to the November baseline. I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly increase from the Black Friday week level as Cyber Week promotions and holiday shopping continue.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic T-shirt has settled into a late-autumn floor following a significant seasonal decline from its summer peak. In the most recent periods (excluding the Period 42 Black Friday spike of 109 units), demand has consistently hovered between 61 and 69 units, with Period 43 returning to 61 units immediately after the holiday promotion. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to remain stable at this established baseline of ~65 units as the product is currently in a low-demand seasonal phase (winter) for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has shown a clear seasonal decline since its summer peak, moving from a plateau of ~400 units to a late-autumn floor of ~66 units. Recent data confirms a further contraction: Period 42 saw a temporary spike to 109 (likely due to Black Friday), but Period 43 and 44 dropped significantly to 61 and 55 units, respectively. Currently, the product is in a low-demand regime. For Period 45 (week of Dec 16), demand is expected to remain low as the weather remains cold and the product is a summer-oriented basic. While there is potential for minor last-minute holiday gifting, the immediate trend (61 to 55) and the 22% decrease from the previous floor suggest a stabilization around the mid-50s level before the holiday break.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor shift confirmed at Period 44: The late-autumn floor of ~66 units has shifted downward to a winter baseline of ~58 units (average of P43-P44), representing a further 12% decline as the product reaches its seasonal low.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is currently in its seasonal trough, with demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt reaching its lowest levels of the year. Historical data from the last three periods (P43-P45) shows a stable winter baseline with values of 61, 55, and 64, averaging approximately 60 units. The current period (P46) covers the week of December 23rd, which includes Christmas and the start of post-Christmas clearance sales. While 'Everyday Basics' are not primary holiday gift items, high retail foot traffic and the commencement of end-of-year promotions typically prevent demand from dropping further and may provide a marginal lift. Given the stability of the current winter floor and the holiday context, the forecast maintains the recent average with a slight upward adjustment for holiday sales volume.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product is currently in its winter seasonal low, with a baseline established around 58-60 units (Periods 43-45). The spike in Period 46 (92 units) is attributed to Christmas holiday shopping, similar to the Black Friday spike seen in Period 42 (109 units) which was immediately followed by a return to baseline. As Period 47 (Dec 30) follows the Christmas peak and covers the New Year transition, demand is expected to regress from the holiday high back toward the established winter floor. Given that some post-holiday clearance or gift card activity may occur, the forecast predicts a return to the upper end of the winter baseline.
