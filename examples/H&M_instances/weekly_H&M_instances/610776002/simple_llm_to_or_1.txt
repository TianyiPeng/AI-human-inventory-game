SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the first 5 periods (148, 175, 160, 233, 308) shows a strong upward trend, particularly in the most recent two observations where demand jumped significantly. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' suitable for spring/summer transitions. As the current date is mid-February (late winter/early spring transition), consumer interest in basic layering pieces typically rises. Given the sharp increase from 160 to 308 over the last three periods, there is a clear positive momentum. I will project a continued but slightly moderated increase to account for the recent volatility while following the upward trajectory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt (Tilly) showed a training set range of 148 to 308, with a mean of 204.8. In the most recent period (Period 1, Feb 11), we observed a demand of 266 units, which is above the long-term historical mean but consistent with the upward trend seen toward the end of the training phase. The current date is Feb 18, 2019, which is the latter half of February. As an 'Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt, demand is relatively stable but tends to start increasing as consumers prepare for spring. Given the shift from the training mean (~205) to a recent observation of 266, and the prior value in training being 308, the demand appears to be settling into a higher regime of roughly 250-300 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) showed a steady upward trend in the training data, moving from 148 to 308. In the current test phase, demand has continued this trajectory: Period 1 recorded 266 units and Period 2 recorded 316 units (+18.8%). We are now entering Period 3 (starting 2019/2/25), which aligns with the arrival of spring in the Northern Hemisphere\u2014a peak season for lightweight jersey basics. Given the sustained week-on-week growth and seasonal favorability, I expect another moderate increase. A 10-15% growth over last week places the forecast between 345 and 365.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown a significant step-up from the training period average (approx. 200 units) to a higher plateau in the test phase (Periods 1-3 average: 296 units). The three most recent observations (266, 316, 306) suggest a new mean demand level around 300 units as we move into March. March 4th marks the transition into early spring, a period where basic jersey layers typically see stable or slightly increasing demand in the retail cycle. Given the relative stability between Period 2 and 3, I expect demand to remain within this established high-volume range, accounting for a slight leveling off of the initial sharp upward momentum seen at the start of February.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019/02/11: mean demand increased from ~200 to ~300 units (+50%) compared to initial historical training data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to -1) showed a mean demand of approximately 205. However, since the start of the test phase (Period 1), there has been a significant upward shift. The observed demands for the last four periods are 266, 316, 306, and 283, establishing a new mean of approximately 293 units. This represents a ~43% increase over the initial training average. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basic), which typically sees rising demand as the spring season approaches in March. Recent demand has stabilized around the 280-310 range. Given the slight dip in Period 4 (283) from the peak in Period 2 (316), and the transition deeper into the spring shopping season, I predict the demand to remain within this new high-level regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to 0) averaged ~205 units. Since Period 1 (late Feb), the demand shifted upward to a higher regime, averaging 284 units over the last five periods (266, 316, 306, 283, 252). There is a slight downward cooling trend over the last three weeks (306 to 283 to 252), suggesting the initial 'Spring/New Season' surge may be stabilizing. The current date (2019/3/18) is mid-March, which is peak season for 'Basic T-shirts' as weather warms. While the last period dropped to 252, the moving average remains high. I expect the demand to remain within the 250-280 range, accounting for a slight reversion to the current regime mean while acknowledging the recent dip.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shifted from an initial training mean of ~185 to a new regime averaging ~282 over the last 6 periods. Looking at the recent test data (Periods 1-6), demand spiked initially (316, 306) but has since stabilized and slightly softened (283, 252, 270), averaging 268 over the last three weeks. The current date (2019/3/25) marks the transition into spring, which typically sustains demand for basic lightweight jersey tops. Given the recent stabilization around the 270 mark and the lack of immediate major holiday spikes in late March, I expect the demand to remain consistent with the recent three-week average.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 204.8 units. Starting with Period 1 (2019/2/11), there was a shift to a higher demand regime. Between Period 1 and Period 6, demand remained stable at a higher plateau, averaging approximately 282 units. Period 7 (2019/3/25) shows a significant spike to 364 units. This increase likely reflects a seasonal boost as the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) becomes more relevant for mid-spring weather and potential pre-Easter shopping (late March/early April). Given the jump in Period 7, I expect demand to remain elevated or show slight momentum, though I will be cautious not to over-extrapolate the single-period spike. I am centering the forecast around the 350-370 range to account for sustained spring demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a regime shift around February (Period 1) from ~200 to ~280 units. In the most recent two weeks (Period 7-8), there has been a significant secondary surge to the 360-370 range (364, 372). This aligns with the transition into April, a peak period for 'Womens Everyday Basics' and lightweight jersey T-shirts as spring weather stabilizes and pre-Easter shopping begins. Given the upward trajectory and seasonal relevance, I expect demand to remain high or slightly increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $930.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, a staple for spring/summer. Assessment of the historical data shows three distinct phases: (1) Training phase (avg ~185), (2) Early Spring phase (Periods 1-6, avg ~282), and (3) Late Spring peak (Periods 7-8, avg ~368). Period 9 saw a significant drop to 271, which likely represents a post-peak correction or a temporary lull after the late March/early April surge. Given the current date is mid-April (2019/4/15), temperatures are rising, supporting sustained demand for basics. The drop in Period 9 (271) mirrors the mean of the earlier 'regime shift' (~280-300). I expect demand to stabilize around this new mean rather than returning to the training data levels, likely seeing a slight recovery as the weather warms further toward May.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand level for Spring confirmed: Periods 1-9 average 302 units, establishing a persistent baseline nearly 60% higher than the initial training data mean (~185).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~205, but test observations (P1-P10) show a sustained regime shift to a mean of approximately 303 units. Recent demand fluctuates between 271 and 372. The current date (2019/4/22) follows the Easter peak (likely represented by P7-P8). As a lightweight jersey T-shirt, demand is expected to remain firm moving into late April and early May (spring/summer transition). Given the most recent observation of 310 and the established seasonal baseline of ~302, I forecast a similar level for the current period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic upper-body garment (T-shirt) is showing a strong upward seasonal trajectory as we transition from Spring into Summer. Period 11 (starting April 22) saw a significant surge to 564 units, which likely reflects a combination of post-Easter retail activity and increasing temperatures driving demand for jersey basics. While the jump from the previous 4-week average (~330) to 564 is substantial, the upcoming Period 12 (starting April 29) includes the May 1st holiday period, which typically sustains high retail volume. I expect demand to remain well above the previous 300-unit baseline but regress slightly from the P11 peak as the immediate holiday spike settles into a higher seasonal mean. A forecast of 445 accounts for this seasonal elevation while acknowledging the recent high-volume trend.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday T-shirt) has undergone a significant transformation. The initial training data average was 185. Since Period 1, demand shifted to a higher mean (avg ~300). However, a secondary surge is evident starting in late April (Period 11), coinciding with the transition into warmer spring/summer weather and the end of April retail peaks. Period 11 saw a peak of 564 (Easter Monday week) followed by a correction to 424 in Period 12. As we move into May (Current Date 2019/5/6), demand is expected to remain well above the previous 300-unit baseline due to seasonal relevance for 'lightweight jersey' t-shirts. The forecast accounts for a slight stabilization after the Period 11 outlier but maintains the current high-velocity momentum.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 11 (Late April): 3-period average has risen to ~430 units, representing a further ~40% increase over the Period 10 baseline of 302 units, driven by seasonal spring/summer demand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday T-shirt) shows a clear seasonal upward shift as weather warms. Periods 1-10 established a baseline average of approximately 301 units. Starting in Period 11 (late April), the demand entered a higher regime, though highly volatile (564, 424, 304). The drop to 304 in Period 13 suggests a correction from the initial late-April peak, but remains aligned with the 'Late April' regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights. Given the date (mid-May) and the product type (lightweight jersey T-shirt), demand is expected to remain in this elevated range. I will forecast a value reflecting a stabilization of this recent 3-period trend (avg: 430), while acknowledging the downward turn of the most recent data point. A forecast slightly above the Period 10 baseline but below the volatile peak is appropriate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is high-demand during warmer months. Analysis of historical data shows a clear upward progression: the initial training average was ~185; Periods 1-10 averaged ~302; and the most recent 4 periods (11-14) have averaged ~431 units. The demand in Period 11 (564) and Period 14 (431) indicates high volatility but a significantly higher baseline as we move into late May. The current date (2019/5/20) aligns with the start of peak summer shopping. While Period 13 saw a dip to 304, Period 14 rebounded strongly to 431. Given the seasonal relevance of basic jersey T-shirts in late May, I expect demand to remain elevated near the recent average of the high-regime (431), adjusting slightly for the momentum seen in the last period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (avg ~185) has been superseded by a significantly higher test phase demand. Looking at recent performance, the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) has entered its peak seasonal window (May). A demand regime shift was noted in Period 13 as the baseline rose to ~430 units. Over the last five periods (Periods 11-15), the demand has averaged 433 units. While Period 11 saw a significant spike (564), the most recent two periods (431 and 442) indicate a very stable and high plateau as we enter late May. Given the consistency of the last two weeks and the seasonal relevance of the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt for warmer weather, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU ('Tilly' Jersey Basic T-shirt) has shown a clear upward trajectory as the season transitions from spring to summer. The initial baseline of ~185 units rose to a ~300-unit average in early spring, and further increased to a ~430-unit average over the last six periods (Periods 11-16). Specifically, the last three periods (14, 15, 16) have been remarkably stable, with demand of 431, 442, and 435 units respectively (mean = 436). Given that June 3rd marks the beginning of meteorological summer and peak demand for 'Everyday Basics' t-shirts, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or slightly increase due to seasonal momentum. The forecast follows the recent three-period stability.

Carry-over insight: Summer baseline consolidation: Demand has stabilized at a high-level mean of ~435 units over Periods 14-16, confirming the sustainability of the secondary regime shift identified in Period 13.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this basic T-shirt has shown two distinct regime shifts, currently sitting at a summer baseline of approximately 435 units (Periods 14-16). Period 17 (June 3rd) saw a significant spike to 640 units, likely driven by the onset of warmer June weather and typical beginning-of-month shopping behavior. Period 18 (June 10th) follows this spike. While demand often regresses toward the baseline after such a sharp peak, the transition into peak summer usually maintains higher-than-average volume. I anticipate demand will cool down from the 640 high but remain elevated above the 435 baseline, settling around the 530 mark as the summer trend continues.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data indicates a well-established summer demand regime for this T-shirt SKU. Carry-over insights and recent data (Periods 14-16) identified a consolidated summer baseline of approximately 435 units. While Period 17 experienced a significant spike to 640 units, Period 18 saw a correction back to 419 units, suggesting the spike was a transient event rather than a new regime shift. As we are in mid-June (June 17), demand is expected to remain firm and align with the established summer baseline of ~430-440 units typical for a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey t-shirt. The forecast is set near the recent 5-period average (excluding the outlier).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:

The historical training data (avg 185) was surpassed early on by a Spring baseline of ~300. Demand shifted again in mid-April/May to a Summer baseline of ~435 (observed in Periods 14-16 and 18-19). Period 17 (640) was a localized peak, likely a promotion or pre-summer surge. The most recent two periods (419, 439) show a return to the established Summer regime identified in Carry-Over Insights. For Period 20 (June 24), which falls in peak summer for a lightweight jersey t-shirt, demand is expected to remain stable around this high-level mean of ~435-440.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU (Womens Everyday Basics) has shown two distinct regime shifts, currently consolidating at a high-volume summer baseline (avg ~435 units). However, Period 20 (2019/6/24) shows a sharp dip to 301 units. Analyzing the calendar, Period 21 (2019/7/1) coincides with the week of July 4th. While this is a US-centric holiday, retail patterns for summer basics often see a mid-summer surge for vacation wear. The recent dip in Period 20 is likely a temporary fluctuation below the established mean of ~435-440 units seen in Periods 14-19. I expect demand to mean-revert toward the summer baseline as the peak season continues, though I will weight the recent dip slightly to be conservative.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows two previous demand regimes: a spring baseline around 300 units and a summer peak period (starting Period 11) where demand averaged ~435 units, with a spike up to 640. However, the last two periods (Period 20: 301, Period 21: 232) indicate a sharp downward trend. July 8th often marks the end of peak 'new summer wardrobe' shopping and the beginning of summer clearance cycles or a mid-summer lull for basic jersey t-shirts. The average of the last three periods is 324, but the most recent observation (232) suggests the high summer regime has ended. I expect demand to continue this downward correction towards the earlier spring baseline or slightly lower as the season transitions, forecasting a stabilization near the recent low.

Carry-over insight: End of Summer surge: Demand has dropped significantly from the Period 14-19 average of ~468 units to a 2-period average (P20-21) of 266 units (-43%), signaling an exit from the high-summer demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear breakdown of demand phases for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. After a high-summer peak averaging ~468 units (Periods 14-19), demand has experienced a sharp downward shift. The last three periods (P20-22) have recorded demands of 301, 232, and 238 respectively, averaging approximately 257 units. This represents a ~45% decline from the summer peak, aligning with the Carry-Over Insight regarding the exit from the high-summer regime. As we move further into July (2019/7/15), the demand appears to have stabilized at this lower baseline. There is no evidence of a further immediate decline or a rebound, so I will forecast a value near the recent 3-period average, accounting for the slight stabilization seen between P21 and P22.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: Demand has maintained a new baseline of ~257 units over the last 3 periods (P20-22), down from the ~468 unit summer average.

Predicted demand: 242 units

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant and sustained drop from the summer peak (averaging ~460 units in May/June) to a lower baseline in July. The last three periods (P21-P23) have recorded 232, 238, and 212 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of ~227 units. This indicates the market for lightweight jersey T-shirts is cooling as the peak summer season passes. Period 23 was the lowest in the recent set (212), suggesting a slight ongoing downward drift or stabilization at this lower level. Therefore, the forecast for Period 24 is set at 215, reflecting this recent average and the seasonality of the product.

Carry-over insight: Refined post-summer baseline: Demand has settled into a lower range with a 3-period average (P21-P23) of ~227 units, a further -12% decrease from the initial post-summer stabilization identified in P22 (~257 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (T-shirt) has entered a clear post-summer decline. After the summer peak reaching over 400-600 units, demand dropped sharply in late June. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has stabilized into a much lower range: 232, 238, 212, and 207 units respectively. This shows a steady, slight downward drift as the season transitions further away from peak summer demand. The average of the most recent three periods (P22-P24) is approximately 219 units, with the two most recent periods specifically hovering around 210. Given the date (July 29) and the consistent recent trend, I expect the demand to remain within this established lower baseline, potentially seeing a very slight further softening.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows three distinct phases: a Spring baseline (~300 units), a Summer peak (avg ~460 units), and a post-summer decline starting in Period 20. The most recent three periods (P23-P25) have seen demand drop from 212 to 207 to 154 units. The current date is August 5, 2019. For a lightweight jersey T-shirt, we are now fully exiting the peak summer season and entering a late-summer/pre-autumn lull. Period 25 (154 units) showed a sharp 25% drop from the previous 4-week average (~207), suggesting the product is reaching its end-of-season troughs or returning to its original historical training data levels (~185 units). Given the speed of the recent decline, I expect Period 26 demand to stabilize around the 150-160 range as the downward momentum slows near the original baseline.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer transition complete: Demand has fallen from a July average of ~222 units to a late-July level of 154 units (-30%), returning to the initial historical training mean (~185 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this Women's jersey t-shirt has shown a sharp downward trend as the peak summer season concludes. Historical Carry-over insights noted a transition back to the initial training mean (~185 units) in late July. However, the last two periods (P25: 154, P26: 102) show a continued decline that has now fallen significantly below that initial mean. Period 26 demand (102 units) represents a 34% drop from Period 25 and is the lowest observed demand across the entire 26-period test set. As we enter mid-August (2019/8/12), the product is likely moving into a clearance or end-of-season phase where demand typically continues to taper before stabilizing at a low 'off-season' baseline. I expect demand to continue its decline but perhaps at a decelerating rate as it approaches a floor.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer decline acceleration: Demand has crashed from a late-July level of ~154 units to ~102 units in early August, falling well below the initial training mean and signaling a definitive end to the seasonal cycle.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002, a lightweight basic Jersey T-shirt, has been in a steep decline since late June (Period 20), following its peak summer season. The carry-over insights correctly identified a series of downward regime shifts as the product exited the high-summer demand period. Over the last three periods (P25-P27), demand has fallen to 154, 102, and 120 units respectively, creating a new late-summer baseline average of approximately 125 units. This level is significantly lower than the initial historical training mean of 185, suggesting the product is entering a low-demand phase for the autumn transition. Given that Period 27 showed a minor stabilization/slight bounce from 102 to 120, a forecast near this recent average is appropriate as the rapid decline appears to be bottoming out at this new floor.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late-summer bottoming out: Demand has stabilized over the last two periods (P26-P27) at an average of 111 units, establishing a new floor roughly 40% below the initial historical training mean of 185.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 26-28) shows a recovery from a trough of 102 units. Demand has risen consecutively from 102 to 120 and most recently to 158 units. This upward movement suggests the 'bottoming out' phase identified in the Period 28 carry-over insight is transitioning into a stabilization or slight recovery as we approach late August. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt, which remains relevant as a layering piece during the late-summer transition. The 3-period moving average is currently ~127, but the momentum is clearly upward. I will forecast a continued moderate increase, aligning with the observed strengthening over the last two weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly seasonal towards warmer weather. Historically, demand peaked in June (Period 17: 640 units) and has since undergone a sustained decline as the season transitions into autumn. The carry-over insights note a 'bottoming out' around Period 28 (avg ~111). However, the most recent three periods (P27-P29) show a slight upward stabilization compared to the Period 26 floor (102), with demand values of 120, 158, and 140. This suggests a post-summer floor has been established in the 130-150 range for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey items. The current date is 2019/09/02 (Start of September); normally, demand for lightweight T-shirts continues to soften or stay flat as temperatures drop. Given the recent average of the last three periods (139 units), I expect demand to remain relatively stable at this new low-season baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer floor confirmation: Demand has stabilized over the last 3 periods (P27-P29) at an average of 139 units (+25% vs P26 low), establishing a late-season baseline for basic jersey items.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt SKU has seen multiple seasonal regimes. After a significant summer peak (P14-P19 avg ~468), demand entered a sustained decline, eventually bottoming out in August. The carry-over insights and recent data indicate a post-summer floor has been established. Over the last 4 periods (P27-P30), demand has stabilized with observations of 120, 158, 140, and 145 units, resulting in a 4-period average of 141 units. The date 2019/09/09 marks the transition into early autumn where basic jersey tops typically maintain a steady, low-level baseline compared to high summer. Given the tight clustering around 140-145 in recent weeks, I expect demand to remain stable for this period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic T-shirt has entered a period of extreme stability following the post-summer decline. Over the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has remained within a tight range of 120 to 158 units, with the most recent three periods (P29-P31) showing almost negligible variance (140, 145, 141). Specifically, the 3-period average is 142 units and the 5-period average is 141 units. As of mid-September (2019/09/16), the product is in a transitional 'shoulder' season where it likely serves as a layering basic rather than a primary summer garment. No significant retail events or seasonal triggers are immediate in the next week to disrupt this established baseline. Therefore, I am forecasting a continuation of this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn stability confirmed: Demand has remained highly consistent over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) with a mean of ~141 units, establishing a firm floor for the shoulder season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the 'Tilly' jersey T-shirt has shown significant seasonality, peaking in the spring/summer months and declining into a stable baseline as it enters the autumn season. Recent performance (Periods 27-32) shows a remarkably consistent demand pattern, with observations of 120, 158, 140, 145, 141, and 135 units. The 6-period mean is approximately 140 units, and the most recent 3-period mean (P30-P32) is 140 units. As we are now in late September (2019/9/23), there are no major immediate retail spikes expected for a basic lightweight jersey t-shirt, and the product has clearly settled into its autumn baseline. The forecast predicts a continuation of this stable mean with a slight downward variance based on the most recent observation.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt) has entered a period of extreme stability following the mid-year seasonal decline. Historical demand over the last seven periods (P27 to P33) shows a very tight range between 120 and 158 units, with a mean of 140.8. The most recent three periods (P31, P32, P33) have recorded 141, 135, and 147 units respectively, resulting in a 3-period average of 141. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey t-shirt, it has reached its typical autumn baseline. Calendar considerations for late September/early October (Period 34) do not suggest any major retail spikes for basic lightweight jersey items. Therefore, the forecast remains anchored to the established 7-period mean.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Tilly Jersey T-shirt) has exhibited a remarkably stable demand floor throughout the autumn shoulder season. Analysis of the recent 8 periods (P27-P34) shows demand hovering around a mean of 132 units. While Period 34 saw a dip to 106 units, this follows a pattern of minor fluctuations within the 100-150 range observed since early August. The product, described as 'lightweight jersey,' is seasonally less relevant in October (Period 35, Oct 7) for colder climates, supporting the continuation of this low-level baseline rather than an upward shift. No major retail events are imminent in early October that would drive a jersey basic spike. The forecast anticipates a slight regression toward the recent 5-period mean of ~135, acknowledging the current downward drift.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this product (Tilly T-shirt). After a high summer peak (P14-P19 avg ~468), demand entered a sustained decline, stabilizing in early autumn (P27-P33) with a mean of ~141 units. However, the last two observations (P34: 106, P35: 85) show a significant downward shift, moving away from the previously established 'floor'. This suggests a new regime shift as the weather cools further in mid-October. The current average of the last two periods is 95.5 units. Given the momentum of the drop (85 being the lowest demand since the training period), I expect demand to continue at this lower level or slightly lower before stabilizing for the winter season.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn regime shift: Demand has broken below the Period 32 stable floor (~141 units), with the two most recent periods (P34-P35) averaging 95.5 units, representing a ~32% decrease as seasonal relevance for lightweight jersey T-shirts diminishes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has entered a distinct late-autumn low-demand phase. After a period of stability around 140 units (P27-P33), demand dropped significantly in P34 (106) and has settled at a new floor in P35 (85) and P36 (84). Given the date (October 21) and the product's profile as a lightweight basic, no immediate seasonal recovery is expected. The forecast reflects the stabilization at this lower baseline of approximately 84-85 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Tilly' lightweight jersey T-shirt shows a late autumn stabilization at a lower volume. After the regime shift identified in Period 36 (where the mean dropped to ~95.5 units), the last four periods (P34-P37) have recorded 106, 85, 84, and 109 units respectively. This averages to approximately 96 units over the last month. The slight uptick to 109 units in Period 37 suggests some minor variance but does not indicate a trend reversal, as the item (a lightweight summer-style basic) faces decreasing seasonal relevance in late October (2019/10/28). I expect demand to remain within this established late-season range.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is seasonally less relevant in November (Late Autumn/Early Winter). Historically, demand has been on a downward trajectory since the summer peak. Analysis of the most recent periods shows a clear softening of demand: the last 5 periods (P34-P38) have averaged 92.4 units, down significantly from the early autumn floor of ~141 units. Specifically, the last two periods (P37-P38) averaged 93.5 units, but Period 38 saw a drop to 78 units, indicating continued weakness. While we are approaching the holiday/Black Friday season, basic T-shirts often experience a secondary lift only closer to peak shopping dates; however, current momentum is downward. I forecast demand to remain at this new suppressed level near the recent average, adjusted for the low point seen in P38.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basic) has entered a clear late-autumn/winter decline. Historically, demand was stable around 140 units until Period 33, after which a regime shift occurred. Over the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged approximately 87 units, but the most recent trend is even lower, with the last two periods showing 78 and 61 units respectively. This downward trajectory reflects diminishing seasonal relevance as temperatures drop in November. The current date (Nov 11) is well into the off-season for short-sleeve basics. Given the sharp drop from 109 to 61 over the last three periods, I expect demand to settle at a low-level baseline near the most recent observation, as the item reaches its winter trough.

Carry-over insight: Early Winter Trough: Demand has reached a new seasonal low, with a 3-period average (P37-P39) of ~83 units, representing an secondary decline from the late autumn floor (~95 units) identified in Period 36.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has followed a clear seasonal trajectory, peaking at over 400 units in summer and declining steadily through autumn. As of mid-November (Period 41), the product is in a seasonal trough. The demand over the last three periods (P38-P40) has averaged approximately 69 units (78, 61, 69), which is a significant drop from the late autumn floor of ~95 units previously identified. With winter approaching, demand is expected to remain at this low baseline. While Black Friday (late November) may offer a minor lift in subsequent periods, Period 41 is expected to continue the established low-level stability witnessed in the first half of November.

Carry-over insight: Early Winter floor confirmation: Demand has stabilized at a low-level mean of ~69 units over the last 3 periods (P38-P40), representing a 27% decrease from the late autumn plateau of ~95 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The product experienced a high-summer demand peak (~430-470 units), followed by a steady decline through autumn. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The current date is November 25th, entering the late-year holiday shopping season (Black Friday week). While the item is a lightweight T-shirt (summer-leaning), basic jersey items often see a moderate uptick during major retail events like Black Friday, despite seasonal mismatch. (3) Recent trend analysis: Over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), demand has bottomed out and stabilized at a low floor, averaging ~69 units, which aligns with winter baseline expectations. (4) Final forecast logic: Given the current week contains Black Friday (2019/11/29), a proactive upward adjustment to the established ~69 unit floor is warranted. I expect a modest increase in demand due to site-wide traffic and promotions, even for basic out-of-season items.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand analysis shows that the product had entered a 'Winter Trough' period (P38-P41) with a stable baseline of approximately 69 units. However, Period 42 (Nov 25 - Dec 1) observed a significant jump to 109 units (+63% vs the recent average), which aligns perfectly with the retail calendar for Black Friday 2019. Period 43 (Dec 2 - Dec 8) encompasses Cyber Monday (Dec 2) and the first week of December holiday shopping. While Black Friday often represents the primary peak, the presence of Cyber Monday and the general holiday gift-buying momentum are expected to keep demand elevated well above the 69-unit trough baseline, though potentially slightly lower than the absolute Black Friday peak. I'm forecasting a relative stabilization around 95 units to account for the tapering off of the major promotion while maintaining holiday shopping levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized at its 'Early Winter Floor' identified in Period 41. Recent demand (P39-P43) shows a consistent baseline of approximately 60-70 units, punctuated by a brief spike to 109 in Period 42 (Nov 25) which corresponds to Black Friday activity. Period 43 returned immediately to the seasonal floor (61 units). For Period 44 (Dec 9), there are no major retail drivers expected to significantly lift demand for lightweight basics above this floor before the late December holiday peak. Therefore, the forecast is set near the current stable mean of approximately 65 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a seasonal winter trough. Historically, the product saw a peak during spring/summer (averaging ~435 units) and has steadily declined through autumn. Recent periods P43 and P44 show demand levels of 61 and 55 units respectively, following a brief Black Friday spike in P42 (109 units). For Period 45 (commencing Dec 16), we are entering the final full week before Christmas. While this is a high-traffic period for retail, this specific item is an 'Everyday Basic' lightweight T-shirt, which is less likely to see a significant gift-driven spike compared to seasonal winter wear. However, general holiday foot traffic often provides a small lift to basics. Given the downward trend from 61 to 55 in the last two weeks, I expect demand to stabilize or slightly recover due to pre-holiday shopping volume.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal low period (Winter). Historical analysis shows a significant downward trend from summer peaks (~460 units) to an early winter floor established around Period 41 (~69 units). In the last five periods (P41-P45), demand has averaged 71.2 units, despite a brief outlier in Period 42 (109 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions). The most recent observations (P43-P45) show a tight cluster with an average of 60 units (61, 55, 64). As Period 46 coincides with the week of December 23rd, retail demand for lightweight basic layering items often sees a minor uptick due to holiday gift-giving and post-Christmas sales, though the overall seasonal trend remains low. I expect demand to remain near the established winter floor with a slight marginal increase from the immediate trailing average.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for this lightweight jersey T-shirt, with a significant decline during autumn and winter. The demand reached a seasonal floor in early December, averaging approximately 60-70 units (P40-P41, P43-P45). However, Period 46 (Dec 23) showed a significant uptick to 92 units, likely driven by Boxing Day and post-Christmas clearance activity. Period 47 (Dec 30) encompasses the New Year period. While the holiday surge typically cools, 'Everyday Basics' often benefit from New Year 'wardrobe refresh' trends and ongoing winter sales. I expect demand to remain elevated above the early December floor but slightly lower than the immediate post-Christmas peak.
