SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand series shows a clear upward trajectory over the five training points [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The date is Feb 11, 2019. In the retail calendar, this is the transition from late winter to early spring. For a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, we expect demand to rise as customers prepare for warmer weather. 3. Trend Analysis: There is a significant acceleration in the last two periods (233 to 308). The average of the training data is 204.8, but the momentum is strongly positive. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the product's classification as an 'Everyday Basic' and the shift into the spring fashion cycle, I expect the upward trend to continue, though potentially at a slightly moderated pace after the recent 32% jump.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed upward demand trend: demand increased from 148 to 308 over the last 5 periods, showing strong momentum entering the Spring season.

Predicted demand: 345 units

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The training data showed a strong upward trend from 148 to 308. Period 1 observed demand was 266 units, which is a slight softening compared to the peak of the training set (308) but remains significantly higher than the training average (~205). 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The date 2019-02-18 is late winter/early spring. As a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, demand typically ramps up as customers prepare for warmer weather. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: The drop from 308 (end of training) to 266 (Period 1) suggests the initial rapid acceleration has stabilized into a high-demand regime rather than a vertical climb. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the product's relevance to the upcoming spring season and the high baseline established in the last few data points, demand is expected to remain robust. I expect a slight uptick as we move deeper into February, forecasting 285 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an upward trend ending at 308. In the test phase, Period 1 started slightly lower at 266 but showed a significant increase to 316 in Period 2. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which typically sees rising demand as the weather warms towards Spring (late February). The jump from 266 to 316 represents an 18.8% increase. Given the momentum from both historical data and the last two observed periods, demand is expected to continue climbing as we enter March.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a strong upward trend peaking at 308. In the current test phase (Periods 1-3), demand has stabilized at a higher level with observations of 266, 316, and 306, resulting in a three-period average of 296. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly relevant as we enter March (Spring season), typically seeing increased demand for basics. Period 3 (306) shows stability following the Period 2 peak (316). Given the seasonal momentum and the product's status as a 'Womens Everyday Basic', I expect demand to remain strong and slightly increase as weather warms up.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Average demand has shifted from a historical mean of ~205 to a sustained level of ~300 (+46%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward shift compared to the initial training data (avg 205), stabilizing at a higher plateau in the 'Test Phase' with an average of approximately 293 units over the last four weeks. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is highly relevant as we move further into March (Spring season). While demand dipped slightly from 316 to 283 over the last three periods, this represents a stabilization rather than a downward trend, likely settling into the new regime identified in the carry-over insights (~300). Given the date (March 11) and the product type, seasonal demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase. I am forecasting a slight recovery towards the current regime mean.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an upward trend peaking at 308. In the current test phase (Periods 1-5), demand peaked at 316 (P2) but has since shown a steady decline: 306 (P3), 283 (P4), and 252 (P5). This represents a three-period downward trend after the initial Spring launch surge. However, as a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt in late March (2019/3/18), demand is expected to find a floor as seasonal weather warms. The forecast anticipates a moderation of the recent decline, stabilizing near the 240-unit mark rather than continuing the steep drop seen in P5, as the product enters its peak seasonal relevance.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this T-shirt (SKU 610776002) showed a strong upward trend during the training phase, peaking at 308. In the current test phase (Periods 1-6), demand has stabilized into a high-level regime, averaging approximately 282 units. Recent performance (Periods 4-6) shows a slight cooling from the Period 2 peak of 316, settling into a range between 252 and 283. As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are entering the peak Spring season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' (lightweight jersey T-shirts). While the most recent three periods (252, 270) suggest a slight stabilization or mild dip compared to February peaks, the transition into late March typically sees sustained demand for layering basics. I expect demand to remain stable or show a slight uptick as warmer weather approaches, aligning with the established regime of ~270-280 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (148 to 308) and recent test data (Periods 1-4, avg ~293) established a new high-demand regime for this basic T-shirt. In Periods 5 and 6, demand dipped slightly (252, 270), but Period 7 (March 25th) saw a significant spike to 364 units. As of Period 8 (April 1st), we are entering the peak spring season for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. The spike in Period 7 likely signals the start of warmer-weather shopping and pre-Easter demand (Easter 2019 was April 21). Given the product category (lightweight jersey T-shirt) and the strong momentum from the previous week, demand is expected to remain high, though slightly moderated from the Period 7 peak as it stabilizes into the April trend.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (148 to 308) and early test data established a high baseline for this basic T-shirt. In the test phase (Periods 1-8), demand initially stabilized around a mean of ~285 (Periods 1-6). However, a significant upward shift occurred in the last two weeks (Periods 7 and 8), with demand jumping to 364 and 372 units respectively. This aligns with the transition into early April (Current Date: 2019/4/8), where warming spring temperatures typically drive demand for 'Everyday Basics' like lightweight jersey T-shirts. The current momentum suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal peak. I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly increase as spring shopping continues, though I will moderate the growth to account for potential stabilization after the recent ~30% spike.

Carry-over insight: New seasonal demand peak confirmed: Demand increased from a baseline of ~285 to over 360 (+28%) starting late March (Period 7), coinciding with Spring seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a baseline of ~285 units. In Periods 7 and 8, there was a significant spike to 364 and 372 units, which aligned with the start of Spring and typical early-April retail surges. However, Period 9 saw a sharp drop back to 271 units, suggesting the initial peak has subsided or normalized. For Period 10 (April 15), we are entering the mid-Spring period. While the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 9 suggested a sustained peak, the most recent data point (271) contradicts a permanent shift to 360+. The forecast weights the recent drop while acknowledging the generally higher Spring baseline compared to February. I expect demand to stabilize around the 280-300 range as the immediate early-April surge cools off.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt shows a clear shift in late March (Period 7), where demand spiked from a baseline of ~280 to over 360, signaling the start of Spring seasonality. Looking at the most recent four periods (P7-P10), the average demand is approximately 329 units. The drop in P9 (271) was followed by a recovery in P10 (310), suggesting that while the initial peak of 370+ has cooled, the demand remains significantly higher than the February/early March levels. For Period 11 (April 22), we are in peak Spring shopping season. Given the recent recovery to 310 and the established seasonal higher mean, I expect demand to stabilize around the recent average of ~320 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a baseline regime of ~280-300 units. Period 11 (2019/4/22) saw a massive spike to 564 units (+82% over the previous period), likely driven by the Easter holiday weekend (April 21-22) and the onset of warmer late-spring weather. Historically, post-holiday periods often see a significant correction as consumer traffic normalizes. However, given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey T-shirt, demand should remain seasonally strong as we enter May. Period 12 (2019/4/29) is the week following Easter; I expect a drop from the holiday peak but for demand to remain above the early-spring baseline of 280-300. Splitting the difference between the recent peak (564) and the seasonal average (~330) suggests a forecast in the high 300s.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' jersey T-shirt shows strong seasonal growth as we move further into spring. Historical demand in the test phase indicates a volatile but upward trajectory. A significant spike occurred in Period 11 (564 units), coinciding with the Easter holiday week (April 22, 2019), followed by a partial correction in Period 12 (424 units). While the Easter peak is likely passing, May demand for everyday basics typically remains higher than March/early April levels due to warming weather. Given the mean of the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is approximately 384 units, and accounting for the post-holiday stabilization, I forecast Period 13 demand to settle around the 390-410 range, maintaining the elevated seasonal baseline observed before the holiday outlier.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a baseline of ~285 units, followed by a seasonal spike in April (Periods 7-8 and 11-12). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is highly relevant as temperatures rise in May. Period 11 (Easter/late April) saw a massive peak of 564, followed by a cooling off period. The most recent demand (Period 13) was 304, indicating a return toward the post-March baseline of ~315. Given that mid-May (Period 14) typically sees sustained interest in light apparel before the summer peak, and looking at the trend following the April spikes, a slight stabilization or moderate increase is expected as weather continues to warm.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter stabilization: Following the extreme peak of 564 in Period 11, demand has stabilized back to a mean of ~360 across the last 3 periods (424, 304, and current), maintaining the higher seasonal baseline established in Period 7.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in its peak seasonal window (late May). Historically, demand transitioned from a baseline of ~280 in early spring to a seasonal plateau of ~360 (established in Period 9). Recent performance shows significant volatility following the Easter spike (564 in P11): P12 reached 424, P13 dipped to 304, and P14 rebounded strongly to 431. This bounce-back in P14 suggests that the underlying demand remains robust as summer approaches. Given the product's classification as an 'Everyday Basic' and the warming weather in late May, demand is expected to remain in the high-300 to low-400 range. I will forecast a slight moderation from the P14 peak while maintaining the elevated seasonal level.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) showed a seasonal baseline of ~360 units established in March/April. Following a stabilization period after the Easter peak (Period 11), demand has surged again over the last two periods (431 and 442 units). This aligns with late May seasonality as temperatures rise and consumer demand for jersey basics increases ahead of summer. Period 15 (442) shows a 40% increase over the baseline of ~315 seen in early May (Periods 10/13). Given the current date (May 27) and the strong upward movement over the last 14 days, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially plateau as the initial late-spring surge stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal surge confirmed: Demand has shifted from a post-Easter baseline of ~360 to a new sustained level exceeding 430 units (+20%) over the last 3 periods (Period 13-15), reflecting late-spring/pre-summer peak demand for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has shown strong seasonal growth as we move into summer. The demand recently stabilized around a new, higher mean following the 'Second seasonal surge' identified in Carry-Over Insights. Over the last three periods (14, 15, and 16), demand has been very consistent: 431, 442, and 435 units (average ~436). The current date is June 3rd, which is the start of the summer peak season for lightweight jersey basics. Given the stability of the recent trend and the lack of immediate holiday spikes (like the Easter peak in Period 11), I expect demand to remain at this established high-baseline level with slight upward pressure due to warming weather.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt has shown distinct seasonal behavior. After establishing a stable baseline of ~436 units between Periods 14-16 (late May), Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640 units. This jump coincides with the lead-up to the Pentecost/Whit Monday holiday weekend (June 9-10, 2019) and the onset of peak summer temperatures, which drives demand for lightweight jersey basics. Following the precedent of the Easter spike in Period 11 (564 units), which was followed by a 25% correction in Period 12 (424 units), I anticipate Period 18 will see a similar post-holiday stabilization. While the demand is expected to drop from the 640 peak, it should remain higher than the May baseline due to sustained summer seasonality. A forecast of 510 reflects a moderate pullback from the holiday high while acknowledging the increased summer demand profile.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic jersey T-shirt has shown distinct seasonal steps. After stabilizing around 360 units in mid-spring, it shifted to a higher baseline of approximately 430 units between Periods 14-16 (late May). Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640, likely due to a mid-June promotional event or a weather-driven surge, followed by a correction to 419 in Period 18. This correction aligns closely with the established late-spring/pre-summer baseline of ~430. Given the current date of June 17, we are in peak summer demand. The forecast assumes demand will return to the stabilized high-summer level observed before the Period 17 spike, accounting for the slight downward momentum from the previous week's correction.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this T-shirt shows a clear upward trajectory as we enter the summer season. Looking at the recent data, Period 17 saw a significant spike to 640 (likely a heatwave or mid-June promotion), followed by stabilization in Periods 18 and 19 at 419 and 439 respectively. The current date is June 24th, moving into the peak summer period where demand for 'lightweight jersey' basics typically remains high and stable. The 'Second seasonal surge' insight noted a level exceeding 430, which is supported by the last two periods (avg 429). Given the steady performance in the low 400s following the outlier in Period 17, and the seasonal relevance of the product in late June, I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product (a basic T-shirt) experienced a sustained peak throughout May and June (Periods 14-19), maintaining a baseline of approximately 435 units, with a significant outlier spike of 640 in Period 17. However, Period 20 (late June) shows a sharp decline to 301 units, a 31% drop from the previous week. This suggests the pre-summer peak demand has likely concluded as the calendar moves into July. The forecast for Period 21 anticipates demand will stabilize near the overall historical average (approx. 350) rather than the extreme peak levels of late Spring. I am projecting a slight recovery from the Period 20 low to a more sustainable mid-summer baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a significant downward trend starting from Period 17 (peak of 640). Since that peak, demand has fallen from the 400s into the 200s (439, 301, 232). This drop aligns with the product description (Tilly lightweight jersey T-shirt) entering the mid-to-late summer phase (July), where early-summer buying surges typically cool down. The average of the last two periods is 266. Given the momentum of the decline (a ~23% drop from Period 20 to 21), I expect demand to stabilize or slightly decrease further as the peak season for 'Everyday Basics' transitions toward late-summer clearance or end-of-season behavior. I will forecast a slight stabilization around the 210-220 range.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand shift confirmed: Demand has declined from a late-spring average of ~430 (Periods 14-19) to a current average of ~265 over the last two periods (-38%), indicating a seasonal transition out of peak summer demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a high-performing summer period (Periods 14-19) with an average exceeding 430 units. Starting in late June (Period 20), there was a sharp decline as the product entered a post-peak summer phase. The last three observations (301, 232, 238) indicate that demand has moved away from the 400+ range and stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, the last two weeks (232 and 238) suggest a new baseline for July. Given the lack of upcoming retail events in mid-July for lightweight basics and the consistent recent performance, the forecast is set near the current two-week average of 235.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for the Tilly T-shirt has clearly transitioned out of its late-spring/early-summer peak (~430-460 units). Since Period 20, there has been a significant decline as the season moves into late July. Recent demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) has averaged 227 units (232, 238, and 212 respectively). This downward trend aligns with the typical retail cycle where summer basics see reduced full-price demand in late July. Given the most recent observation of 212, the forecast anticipates continued stabilization or a slight further decline at this lower seasonal baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt is in a clear seasonal contraction phase following the late-spring/early-summer peak (Periods 14-19 avg ~460). After the initial drop noted in the Period 22 insight, demand has continued to slide from the mid-230s (Periods 21-22) to a new low of 207 in Period 24. As of late July, the product is moving out of its primary seasonal window. The most recent observations (212 and 207) suggest the decline is slowing as it approaches a late-summer baseline. Given the consistent downward trajectory over the last four periods (232, 238, 212, 207), I expect the next period to stay near the 200-unit mark, reflecting the end-of-season tapering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a significant seasonal decline. After peaking in June (avg ~460), demand dropped sharply through July. The last five periods (P21-25) show a consistent downward trajectory: 232, 238, 212, 207, and most recently 154. This represents a shift from the mid-July baseline of ~210 to a new low in late July. As of August 5th (Period 26), demand typically continues to taper off as the retail focus shifts away from summer basics toward fall transitions. Given the momentum of the recent drop from 207 to 154 (-25%), a further slight decline or stabilization at this lower level is expected. The forecast weights the most recent observation and the ongoing downward seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: New downward demand regime confirmed: Demand has dropped from a mid-summer average of ~220 (Periods 21-24) to 154 in Period 25, marking a total decline of over 60% from the late-spring peak as the season transitions into August.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt is in a clear end-of-season decline as we move into mid-August. Historical data shows a sharp downward trajectory over the last three periods (207, 154, 102), representing a week-over-week reduction of approximately 25-30%. As a 'Womens Everyday Basic' in lightweight jersey, its primary seasonal window is closing in favor of autumn collections. The forecast for Period 27 anticipates a continuation of this downward momentum, though the rate of decline may begin to flatten as it approaches a low-season baseline for basic items.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has followed a clear seasonal trajectory, peaking in late spring/early summer (Periods 11-19) and declining steadily through July and August. Recent observations show a sharp drop from the mid-summer average of ~220 to a new lower floor. The last three periods (154, 102, 120) average 125 units, representing a significant reduction as the retail season transitions into late August. Given the slight recovery in Period 27 from the low of 102, the forecast for Period 28 anticipates stabilization at this lower seasonal baseline of approximately 115 units.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor confirmed: Demand has shifted from a mid-summer average of ~220 to a late-August baseline of ~125 (-43%) based on the last 3 periods (154, 102, 120).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 has transitioned from its peak summer season (late spring/early summer) into a late-August baseline. After reaching a seasonal low of 102 in Period 26, demand has shown a steady upward recovery over the last two periods (120 and 158). This uptick likely reflects late-summer 'back-to-school' interest or a stabilization of demand for this 'Everyday Basic' item as it moves out of its trough. Given the momentum of the last two weeks (+18 and +38 respectively), I anticipate demand will continue to rise slightly or stabilize as it enters the end of August, centering the forecast around 175 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product, a lightweight jersey T-shirt, has moved past its peak summer demand phase (Periods 14-19) and has settled into a late-season low. Following the significant decline observed in August where demand bottomed out at 102 (Period 26), the last four periods (102, 120, 158, 140) indicate a stabilization around a new baseline average of approximately 130. As we enter September (Period 30), we expect this lower baseline to persist as the product transitions from a standalone summer item to an everyday basic layering piece. There is no evidence of a further downward trend, but rather a plateauing at this lower volume.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the significant seasonal decline from summer peaks (averaging ~430 in Periods 14-19), demand for this lightweight jersey basic found a floor in August. Over the last five periods, demand has stabilized between 102 and 158. Specifically, the last three periods (Period 28: 158, Period 29: 140, Period 30: 145) show a mean of approximately 148 units, suggesting the late-August baseline identified in Period 28 is slightly higher than initially estimated but remaining relatively flat. As we enter the second week of September, demand for everyday basics typically remains stable without the volatility seen during peak seasonal transitions. Therefore, the forecast is set near the recent 3-period moving average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a significant seasonal decline from the late-spring/early-summer peak (avg ~430) to a much lower baseline in late summer. Following a trough in early August (102 units), demand has stabilized over the last four periods (158, 140, 145, 141). Specifically, the last three periods (P29-P31) show extremely low variance, averaging approximately 142 units. Given the transition into mid-September, demand for this lightweight jersey basic is expected to remain at this stable autumn floor before any potential further seasonal shifts.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized autumn floor confirmed: Demand has consolidated at a mean of ~142 units over the last 4 periods (P28-P31), representing a stable baseline following the summer decline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear stabilization in demand following the summer decline. After peaking in June (P17: 640), demand dropped through July and August. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), the demand has settled into a tight range between 135 and 158, with a five-period average of 143.8. The most recent three weeks (P30-P32) show values of 145, 141, and 135, indicating a very slight downward drift but remaining within the established 'autumn floor' identified in previous insights. Given the product is a lightweight jersey basic, demand is expected to remain low and stable during the late September transition into cooler weather. The forecast weights the most recent period (135) and the stable four-week mean (~140) to predict a continuation of this baseline.

Over the last six periods (P28-P33), demand has fluctuated narrowly between 135 and 158 units, with a mean of approximately 144. As of September 30, the product (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) is in its off-season, but as an 'Everyday Basic', it has found a consistent floor. Recent observations (141, 135, 147) show no significant upward or downward trend, suggesting the current autumn baseline of ~142-145 will persist into the next period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this basic jersey T-shirt has transitioned from a high-summer peak (avg ~430) to a stable autumn baseline. Following the seasonal decline in August, demand consolidated around a mean of ~142 units between Periods 28 and 33. Period 34 showed a dip to 106 units, which is the lowest observation since the autumn stabilization began. While this could indicate a further seasonal cooling as temperatures drop in October, 'Everyday Basics' typically maintain a consistent floor for layering. The forecast expects a slight mean reversion from the Period 34 low toward the established autumn baseline, settling near the recent 4-period moving average of 132.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern for this lightweight jersey T-shirt, with peak demand occurring in the spring and early summer (up to 640 units), followed by a steady decline. While demand stabilized at an 'autumn floor' of approximately 142 units during September (Periods 28-33), the two most recent periods show a significant further breakdown of this support level, with demand dropping to 106 (P34) and 85 (P35). As of mid-October (2019/10/14), the seasonal relevance for lightweight jersey basics continues to diminish in favor of heavier layers. The forecast anticipates a continuation of this low-demand regime, centering near the most recent observation of 85, with a slight downward adjustment for the cooling weather.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has entered a new lower-demand phase as the season transitions into late autumn. While the previous 'autumn floor' was identified around 142 units (Periods 28-31), recent data shows a significant step-down starting in Period 34 (106 units) and stabilizing further in Period 35 (85 units) and Period 36 (84 units). This reflects a 40% reduction from the previous baseline. Given the consistent demand over the last two weeks and the seasonal context of October, the forecast anticipates demand will remain at this new stabilized low.

Carry-over insight: New late-autumn demand regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a September baseline of ~142 to a new sustained level of ~85 (-40%) over the last 3 periods (P34-P36), reflecting the off-season for lightweight jersey basics.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this lightweight T-shirt peaked in spring/summer (P11-P19) and has been in a sustained decline since July. As of late October (Period 37), demand has entered a late-autumn trough. While Period 37 saw a slight uptick to 109 from the previous two weeks (85, 84), the overall average for the last four periods (P34-P37) is approximately 96 units. This level is consistent with the 'late-autumn demand regime' identified in the carry-over insights. Given the end-of-October date (2019/10/28), demand for lightweight jersey basics is expected to remain at this lower baseline or slightly decrease as colder weather sets in, with no significant holiday drivers for this specific category yet. I forecast demand to remain stable near the recent 4-week average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Tilly' lightweight jersey T-shirt is currently in its off-season trough. Historically, demand peaked during Spring/Summer (April-June) and has been in a sustained decline since late July. The most recent carry-over insight (Period 37) established a late-autumn demand regime of approximately 85 units. Since that insight, observed demand has been 109 (P37) and 78 (P38). The average of the last four periods (P35-P38) is 89 units. Given the product's category as a lightweight basic and the current calendar date (early November), demand is expected to remain stable at this low seasonal floor until potential late-November promotional activities (e.g., Black Friday) occur. Therefore, the forecast for Period 39 is set near the recent regime average.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly lightweight jersey T-shirt is currently in a seasonal trough as we move into November. Historical data shows a clear downward trajectory from an autumn baseline of ~142 to a recently established regime of ~85 (confirmed in Period 37). The most recent three periods (109, 78, 61) indicate a continuing decline as colder weather sets in, with Period 39 recording the lowest demand to date (61 units). Given the product category (lightweight jersey basic) is highly seasonal and least relevant in late autumn/early winter, demand is expected to remain near this floor. While Black Friday approaches in late November, Period 40 (Nov 11) is likely too early for a significant holiday lift for this specific basic item. Therefore, I forecast demand to stay consistent with the recent downward trend, stabilizing slightly above the 60-unit mark.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for the 'Tilly' lightweight jersey T-shirt has entered its seasonal low as the weather turns colder in late November. Following the late-autumn regime shift to ~85 units (Periods 34-37), the most recent three periods (38, 39, 40) show a further decline to 78, 61, and 69 units respectively, averaging approximately 69 units. Period 41 (Nov 18-24) immediately precedes the Black Friday shopping week, a period typically characterized by a pre-sale lull as consumers delay purchases. Given the product's seasonal mismatch with the current climate and the recent downward trend, the forecast predicts demand will remain consistent with the current three-week average.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor confirmed: Demand has further declined from the late-autumn baseline of ~85 to a new sustained level of ~70 units over the last 3 periods (P38-P40), reflecting minimum off-season demand for basic T-shirts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (a lightweight jersey T-shirt) has reached its seasonal floor, averaging ~69 units over the last four periods (P38-P41: 78, 61, 69, 67). However, the current period (P42) includes November 29, 2019, which is Black Friday. Despite being an off-season item for late November, 'Everyday Basics' typically experience a significant uplift during major site-wide retail events due to increased traffic and promotional bundling. Historically, this SKU has shown the capacity to spike 50-90% during peak events (e.g., Period 11). I am forecasting a significant increase from the 69-unit baseline to approximately 135 units to account for the Black Friday surge.

The demand for this lightweight jersey basic reached a seasonal floor of approximately 70 units throughout November (Periods 38-41). Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a significant increase to 109 units (+63% over the November average), which corresponds to the Black Friday promotional week. Period 43 (Dec 2) encompasses Cyber Monday and the continuation of the holiday shopping season. Given that basic T-shirts often serve as holiday staples or lower-priced gift items, demand is expected to remain elevated compared to the November baseline, though it may see a slight stabilization following the initial Black Friday surge.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt is currently in its seasonal off-peak, having established a floor of approximately 70 units (Carry-over Period 41). Recent data shows a clear promotional spike in Period 42 (109 units) corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, which immediately subsided in Period 43 (61 units). For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to remain near the established baseline. While general retail traffic increases in December, this specific product category (lightweight basics) typically does not see significant holiday-driven surges outside of major promotional events. Therefore, the forecast aligns with the non-promotional mean of the last 5 periods (excluding the P42 spike), which is approximately 67 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has been in a sustained seasonal decline since the summer peak. Following a brief promotional spike during the Black Friday period (P42: 109), demand has retreated to its lowest levels of the year. The last two periods (P43: 61 and P44: 55) indicate that the previous baseline of ~70 units has broken downward. As of December 16th (P45), the product is in its deepest off-season. Given the recent downward momentum and the fact that basic lightweight T-shirts are not primary Christmas gift drivers, I expect demand to remain at this new low or slightly decline further before stabilizing for the winter trough.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (lightweight jersey T-shirt) is currently in its seasonal off-peak during the winter months. Analysis of the recent data (Periods 43-45) shows demand has further softened from the previous floor of ~70 units to a three-period average of 60 units (61, 55, 64). Period 46 (Dec 23) covers Christmas and the start of post-Christmas sales (Boxing Day). While Black Friday (Period 42) saw a significant spike to 109, Christmas week for a basic summer-weight T-shirt typically sees lower gift-related demand than accessories, though it may benefit slightly from the start of end-of-year clearance sales. I expect demand to remain near the recent baseline of ~60 units, with a slight adjustment for holiday retail activity.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this SKU, a basic T-shirt, follows a clear seasonal pattern, peaking in late spring (P17: 640) and hitting a floor in winter. The most recent demand floor was established around 70 units (P41 insight). Recent data shows a dip to 55-64 units in mid-December, followed by a spike to 92 units in Period 46 (Christmas week). Period 47 (Dec 30) encompasses the post-Christmas clearance and New Year's period. Historically, demand during this transition week remains elevated compared to the early December baseline due to holiday gift-card redemptions and end-of-year sales, but often tapers slightly from the primary holiday peak. I expect demand to settle between the recent floor (70) and the Christmas peak (92).
