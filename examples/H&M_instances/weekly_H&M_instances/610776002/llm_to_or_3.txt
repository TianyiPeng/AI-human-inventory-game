Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 610776002 (Tilly T-shirt). The product is a women's everyday basic jersey T-shirt. Current inventory is 0. Past demand for the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308]. This suggests a growth phase or seasonal ramp-up (mid-February). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero inventory and an increasing demand pattern, I will use a conservative lead time of 4 and focus on the most recent demand regime (last 3 periods: 160, 233, 308) to set mu_hat, ensuring we don't under-order against the upward trend. Sigma_hat will also be based on the recent 3 periods to capture the increased volatility associated with this growth.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 266, which is higher than the historical average of [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (mean of ~205). Since we started with 0 on-hand, we sold 0 and had lost sales. We placed an order of 356 units in Period 1, which is now in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this should arrive in Period 5. For mu_hat, considering the recent upward trend in demand (233, 308 in history and 266 in Period 1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent mean (~269 per period). For lead time L, I will use the promised 'default' of 4. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture volatility across these recent higher-demand periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Evaluation of the product 'Tilly T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) shows a clear upward trend in demand: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308 (pre-game) followed by Period 1 (266) and Period 2 (316). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders placed in Periods 1 or 2 should have arrived yet (expected arrival for P1 is P5, read at P6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, but there are 727 units in-transit from the first two periods. Given the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category and the timing (late February), we are seeing a spring ramp-up. Demand is averaging ~291 over the last two periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent higher-volume regime while the system waits for the first orders to arrive. L remains default (4).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which typically shows steady demand but is currently in a high-demand phase (last 5 samples: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308; and game history reveals Period 1-3 demands of 266, 316, 306). The mean of the last 5 periods [233, 308, 266, 316, 306] is approximately 285.8. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) are expected to arrive in Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 1089 units in-transit (356 + 371 + 362), which is consistent with the promised lead time. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period demand average to capture this higher volume regime (approx 286/period), and use default settings for lead time and sigma until we see the first arrivals to confirm variance and actual lead time behavior.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand samples [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] shown in the prompt are significantly lower than recent observed demand in Periods 1-4 [266, 316, 306, 283]. Average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 293. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet (consistent with L=4). The first order (placed P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in Period 5 conclude. Currently, in-transit is 1433 (sum of orders P1-P4: 356+371+362+344=1433). Because the recent demand (avg ~293) is much higher than the historical data provided in the startup block (avg ~205), I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand regime. I will keep L at default (4) as no evidence yet suggests a deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (March 18). The product is a women's basic jersey t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (including pre-game) shows a general upward trend: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308, 266, 316, 306, 283, 252]. The mean of the last 5 periods is 284.6, which is significantly higher than the initial history. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived at the start of P5). Pipeline inventory is very high (1151 units), which includes orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5. Given the high in-transit volume compared to demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely limit orders to prevent overstocking. I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher baseline demand of the last 5 weeks compared to the earlier history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand shifted to a higher regime (avg ~285) starting around Period 1 compared to pre-game data (avg ~200).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current demand for the SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has averaged 282.2 over the 6 active game periods (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270), which is significantly higher than the pre-game mean of ~200. This shift was marked in carry-over insights at Period 1. We are entering the spring season where basic jersey T-shirts generally maintain steady demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 999 (Sum of orders P3, P4, P5, P6: 362+344+74+219 = 999), and On-hand is 205. Since the demand regime is stable since Period 1, I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current trend for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L will use 'calculate' as it matches the promised lead time of 4 and is consistent in history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have confirmed that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has been consistently higher than the pre-game data (which averaged ~200). Since Period 1, the demand has averaged approximately 294 units per period [266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270, 364]. In the most recent period (P7), we saw a significant spike to 364. This product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, and April (Period 8) is a time when spring demand typically strengthens. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime that started at P1, and for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this specific period. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 1-7 confirmed as higher than pre-game history (current average ~294 vs pre-game ~200). Recent demand spike to 364 in Period 7 (2019/3/25).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). Actual lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on consecutive arrivals from Periods 1-4 occurring in Periods 5-8. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, and we are entering the spring season, which correlates with the sustained increase in demand observed. The demand has shifted from a pre-game average of ~200 to a recent average of ~305 over the last 8 periods. Specifically, the last two periods (Period 7 and 8) show a significant spike (364 and 372). To ensure high service levels while preparing for the (L+1)=5 period lead time window, I will use recent_N to capture this higher demand regime. Setting N=8 for demand (mu_hat) captures the post-start shift, while N=4 for sigma_hat focuses on the recent volatility spike to avoid stockouts during the spring upturn.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 1-8 average is 303.6, with a further acceleration in the last 2 periods (avg 368) vs early periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt. Historically, demand has increased from an average of ~265 in early periods (P1-P5) to ~318 in the last four periods (P6-P9: 270, 364, 372, 271). Note that Period 9's sales were capped by stockouts (ending inventory was 0, with 249 units sold against a demand of 271). Looking at the calendar, we are entering the spring/summer peak for lightweight jersey basics. Arrivals have consistently shown a 4-period lead time. Order P5 (74 units) was small, which led to the current stockout. Order P6 (219 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 10, bringing our on-hand inventory to 219. Total pipeline inventory is 1237. Given the stockout and the rising demand trend for seasonal apparel, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~319.25 per period). Since L=4, mu_hat should reflect demand over L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat with L=4 effectively targets this. This approach balances the need to recover from the stockout while acknowledging the seasonal demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Average demand for women's T-shirts has risen to ~319 over the last 4 periods (P6-P9) as spring/summer seasonality begins.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). History confirms a lead time (L) of 4. Demand for this Women's T-shirt has been rising as we enter the Spring/Summer season. The last 4 periods (P7-P10) show a higher demand regime with an average of approximately 329 units (364, 372, 271, 310) compared to the earlier periods. Specifically, demand in the last two periods was constrained by stockouts, suggesting true demand might be slightly higher than the sold units. We have 0 on-hand inventory and a large pipeline (1430 units). To capture the recent seasonal shift while managing the stockout situation, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher demand level and its volatility. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Last 4 periods (P7-P10) average demand ~329 units, confirming seasonal uptrend for women's T-shirts. Stockouts in P9 and P10 indicate demand is currently outpacing on-hand availability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is experiencing a high-demand regime, likely due to spring seasonality. Period 11 demand surged to 564, significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of ~329. We have been stocking out for the last three periods (P9-P11) because the order placed in P5 (74 units) was insufficient to meet the rising demand. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and significant in-transit quantities, we need to bridge the demand for L+1 (5 periods). The current demand of 564 might be an outlier or a peak, but the trend is clearly upward. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent acceleration (avg ~376) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak detected in Period 11 (564 units), confirming strong spring seasonality for jersey basics. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has risen to ~376 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (Early May). The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/summer seasonal demand phase. Historically, demand has surged from ~200 pre-game to an average of ~376 over the last five periods (P7-P11), with a season high of 564 in P11. We have experienced stockouts in the last four consecutive periods (P9-P12) because actual demand (averaging 392 units in P9-P12) has consistently exceeded available inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and clear evidence of a higher seasonal demand plateau, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~388 including the latest observed demand of 424). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high volatility during this spring surge. Lead time L is held at the promised 4 periods as observed historically.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P9-P12 averages 392 units, confirming a sustained high-demand phase for summer basics. Stockouts recorded for 4 consecutive periods (P9-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the spring and summer. The history shows a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 7 (late March), with average demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) being approximately 374.6 units. Specifically, Period 11 saw a massive spike to 564. Although demand in Period 13 dropped back to 304, there were stockouts in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12, indicating that historical 'sold' figures underrepresented true demand until the P9 order (407 units) arrived in P13. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=7 captures the regime change that started in late March (Period 7-13). This helps the OR backend project a base stock that accounts for the higher seasonal mean and volatility seen in the last two months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level during spring/summer transition: P7-P13 (7 periods) average demand is 372.7 units (approx +40% vs early game). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has shifted significantly upward due to spring/summer seasonality. The demand average for the last 8 periods (P7-P14) is 380.1 units, with the most recent sample at 431 units. While there were several stockouts in previous periods (P9-P12), on-hand inventory has recently recovered to 84 units with 1535 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained high-demand regime for summer basics, I am using a recent window of N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~380, which results in a mu_hat of ~1900 (5 * 380). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=8 to reflect the increased volatility (Std Dev \u2248 95). This configuration ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the seasonal peak while managing the holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P7-P14 (last 8 samples) average confirmed at 380.1 units, reflecting a ~30% increase from the early game average.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which is in peak demand during the spring/summer transition. We are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) as demand (442 in P15) continues to outpace actual arrivals (306 in P15). Historical arrivals confirm the lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly from the early game (~280) to the most recent 5-period average (P11-P15) of ~433 units. Using N=9 for mu_hat captures the seasonal uptrend (P7-P15 average is ~387) while allowing for the recent volatility. Period 11 (564 units) remains a high-water mark for variance. I will set L to 'calculate' given its stability and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to stay responsive to the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P11-P15 (last 5 samples) average has risen to 433 units, indicating the peak summer season for jersey basics is now fully active.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer season (June 3rd). Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the average demand has been approximately 433.5 units, significantly higher than the early game average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P12 order arriving in P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 127 units, and there are 1,542 units in-transit, which covers more than the 5 periods (L+1) of demand at current rates. Given the transition into June, demand is expected to remain high and stable. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining a stable service level. Setting L to calculate since the observed lead time of 4 matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high for peak summer: P11-P16 average demand is 433.5 units (+14% vs spring regime). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in its peak summer season (June). Demand in Period 17 spiked to 640 units, significantly exceeding the previous high of 564 in Period 11 and the recent regime average of ~433. This indicates a late-spring/early-summer acceleration. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 17 where 597 units were sold against a 640 demand. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P13 order arrived in P17). To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales during the peak season, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand acceleration. The last 7 periods (P11-P17) show an average demand of 462.8 units (564, 424, 304, 431, 442, 435, 640). Using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the higher volatility (range 304 to 640) and the higher mean associated with the summer peak. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak acceleration detected: Period 17 demand reached 640 units. The regime for P11-P17 (last 7 samples) now averages 462.8 units, marking a transition into the highest summer peak for jersey basics.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), the peak summer season for women's jersey basics. Recent demand shows a significant upward trend: the average demand for the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is 448.6 units, but the most recent peak in P17 was 640. Although P18 demand (419) appears lower, it was constrained by a starting on-hand inventory of only 197 units (stockout occurred). The carry-over insight from P18 confirms an accelerating regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this summer regime (avg ~450) and allow the 'mu_hat' to reflect demand across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P10-P14 exactly 4 periods later. On-hand is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 2086 units, but most of that is scheduled far in the future. I need high base stock levels to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained summer peak: Period 11-18 average demand is 448.6 units. Stockouts occurred in 8 of the last 10 periods, indicating persistent under-forecasting relative to summer demand intensity.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late June (2019/6/24), the physiological peak of the summer season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirts. The demand regime from P11 to P19 has consistently outpaced the spring levels, v\u1edbi an average demand of approximately 447 units per period. The most recent demand (P17-P19) has shown extreme volatility, including a peak of 640 and a dip back to 439. To address the persistent stockouts and ensure the OR engine maintains a high service level for this high-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the summer shift from P11-P19) to capture the current mean of ~447. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the increased volatility seen in the summer peak (std ~95). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P11-P19) average confirmed at ~447 units. Stockouts recorded in 9 of the last 11 periods, confirming demand intensity often exceeds on-hand stock and requiring higher base-stock levels.

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (2019/07/01), peak summer season for women's jersey basics. Historical lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand for the last 10 periods (P11-P20) averages 441.4 units, with a noticeable spike in early June (P17: 640). Stockouts have been prevalent (9 of the last 12 periods), though P20 saw a dip to 301. Given the product category and date, we are entering the final high-demand phase of summer. To ensure high service levels and recover from previous stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full breadth of the summer regime, including the high volatility observed in P11 and P17.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in the late summer season (July 8, Period 22). Demand analysis shows a significant cooling of the summer peak: demand in the last two periods (P20: 301, P21: 232) is considerably lower than the preceding summer average (avg ~447). This indicates the peak summer surge has peaked and the demand is transitioning to a post-peak or late-summer regime. I am selecting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (capturing demand since P17) to quickly adjust the forecast downwards from the earlier extreme peak (640 units in P17) while respecting the current downward trend. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 472 and significant pipeline stock (1688), the low N will help prevent over-ordering as seasonality shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for summer jersey basics passed around Period 17 (640 units); demand is now trending downwards (P21 demand: 232 units), indicating a seasonal transition from peak summer to late summer/early autumn.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has clearly transitioned from its peak summer regime (P11-P18 avg ~450) to a lower late-summer/early-autumn regime. The last two periods (P21 and P22) have shown significantly lower demand (232 and 238 units respectively) compared to the preceding weeks. As we are now in mid-July (2019/07/15), this downward trend is expected to continue or stabilize at this lower level as the peak season ends. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this new regime by using recent_N (N=3) to capture the trend of the last three demand samples (301, 232, 238), which averages ~257 units per period. This shift prevents over-ordering and minimizes holding costs, especially since on-hand inventory has risen to 876 units due to large earlier orders arriving (642 units in P22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Period 21-22 average demand (~235 units) marks a ~50% decrease from the peak summer average of ~450 units, signaling the end of the high-season for jersey basics.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has clearly shifted from a peak summer regime (avg ~450) to a late summer/early autumn regime. The demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) has stabilized at 232, 238, and 212 units respectively, averaging 227 units. This confirms the downward trend identified in the carry-over insights. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 1057 units, which is significantly high (covering nearly 5 periods of recent demand). There are also 818 units in-transit (ordered in P20, P21, P22). To avoid excessive holding costs in this declining demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current regime and allow the OR engine to wind down the inventory levels. The lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer demand regime: Periods 21-23 average demand is 227 units, confirming a ~50% drop from the summer peak-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts (SKU 610776002) has clearly transitioned from a peak summer regime (avg ~450) to a late summer/pre-autumn regime. The last four demand samples (P21-P24) are 232, 238, 212, and 207, demonstrating a stable and significantly lower regime (average 222.25). On-hand inventory is currently very high (1266 units) due to previous large orders arriving during this cooling period. With 402 units still in-transit and a demand forecast around 220 units per period, the current total pipeline (1668) already covers approximately 7.5 periods of demand, which exceeds the review + lead time (1+4=5). Therefore, the system should avoid placing new orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4-period regime (N=4) and keep L at default (4) as lead times are stable. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will appropriately capture the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer demand regime confirmed: Period 21-24 average demand is 222.25 units, representing a stable ~50% reduction from the summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) has clearly entered a late-summer/autumn decline. Demand in Period 25 dropped to 154 units, continuing the downward trend from the peak summer regime (~450 units) to the recent late-summer regime (~220 units). The current on-hand inventory is 1,349 units with 165 units in transit (expected in P26), totaling 1,514 units. Given the recent 5-period average (P21-P25) is approximately 209 units, our current stock covers more than 7 periods of demand at this rate. Since lead time is 4 periods and we aim for a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand, we are significantly overstocked. I will set the demand parameters using a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this lower regime, which will naturally result in a zero order from the OR backend because inventory exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward sustained: P21-P25 average is 208.6 units, confirming the end of the high-summer season and a return toward pre-game demand levels (~200).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776002 (Womens T-shirt) has transitioned from the summer peak into a significant late-summer/early-autumn decline. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 102 units, following a downward trend since Period 21. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is approximately 191 units, which is a further reduction from the previous late-summer regime. Current on-hand inventory is 1412 units with zero units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and a review period of 1, the system aims to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current demand level (~191/period), the required inventory (base stock) would be roughly 955 units. Since on-hand inventory (1412) significantly exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current lower demand regime, allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate (likely zero) order quantity to deplete excess stock and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward continues: P21-P26 average demand is 190.8 units, reflecting a return to or slightly below pre-game levels as autumn approaches.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-812.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is continuing its significant downward seasonal trend as autumn approaches (Date: 2019/8/19). Demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) has dropped further, averaging approx 125 units, which is well below the pre-game baseline of ~200. On-hand inventory is currently very high (1292 units) with 0 units in-transit, as previous large orders from the summer peak arrived after demand had already crashed. Given the carrying cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), the priority is to aggressively deplete this excess inventory. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the full scope of the seasonal decline (P21-P27 avg ~178) while allowing the OR backend's capped policy to prevent any new orders until on-hand stock is substantially reduced. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward accelerating: P25-P27 average demand dropped to 125 units (-35% vs previous late-summer regime), confirming deep late-season decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-502.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is in a clear end-of-season decline as we move into late August (Period 29). The most recent demand samples (P25-P28) are 154, 102, 120, and 158, averaging 133.5 units. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (~450) and even the late-summer regime (~220). Currently, on-hand inventory is very high at 1134 units, while there are no units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a projected demand of approximately 133 units per period, the existing inventory covers roughly 8.5 periods of demand (1134 / 133). This is well beyond the required safety stock level for the L+1 window (5 periods). To minimize holding costs while demand continues to soften, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent decline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend will naturally see that on-hand inventory exceeds the base-stock target and will place zero orders, which is appropriate given the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed for late August: P25-P28 average demand is 133.5 units, a ~40% decrease from the early-August regime (~220) and ~70% below the summer peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight women's T-shirt has entered a sustained late-season decline as summer concludes. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is approximately 134.8 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak (~450) and also lower than the early-game average (~280). Currently, on-hand inventory is 994 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory covers over 7 periods of current demand (994 / 135 \u2248 7.36). Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and our pipeline significantly exceeds any reasonable base-stock level calculated from current parameters, the system will naturally order 0 units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent late-August/early-September demand regime accurately. No additional orders are needed until inventory levels normalize relative to the lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime confirmed: P25-P29 average demand is 134.8 units, reflecting the end of summer seasonality and a shift to early autumn levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a sustained late-season decline as we move into September. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) is 133 units, which is a significant drop from the summer peak (~450) and even below the early-season regime (~290). Currently, there is 849 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1 (total 5 periods of demand to cover), the projected demand over the next 5 periods at an average of 133 units is approximately 665 units. Since on-hand inventory (849) already exceeds this coverage requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will set the L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time stability and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (covering P25-P30) to capture the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees the surplus inventory and avoids ordering.

Carry-over insight: Late-season demand regime (P25-P30) is stable and significantly lower, averaging 137.5 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts (SKU 610776002) has entered a stable late-season/autumn regime following the summer peak. Analysis of the last 7 periods (P25-P31) shows a consistent demand range between 102 and 158, with an average of 137.1 units. The previous peak summer demand (~450) and intermediate late-summer (~220) periods have definitively passed. On-hand inventory is currently 708 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~137, the existing stock covers approximately 5 periods of demand (708 / 137 \u2248 5.1). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods (L=4) and base stock is calculated for L+1 periods (5 periods), the current inventory is nearly optimal for the current regime. I will set the L parameter to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture only the stable late-season behavior, ensuring the OR engine does not over-order based on historical summer spikes.

Carry-over insight: Late-season/Autumn demand regime confirmed stable (P25-P31): Average demand is 137.1 units, representing the baseline for the product outside of the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1)' (women's jersey t-shirt) is in a post-summer late-season regime. Historical demand since Period 25 (covering late August through mid-September) has stabilized at a significantly lower average of ~137 units per period, down from the peak summer average of ~450. The current date is September 23, 2019, which aligns with early autumn demand for lightweight basics in a retail context. On-hand inventory is currently high (573 units), which at current demand levels covers approximately 4 periods (the lead time). There is no immediate need to place large orders given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0). I will use the last 8 samples (P25-P32) to characterize this late-season demand regime, as this period consistently shows a return to baseline levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-season/Autumn demand regime (P25-P32) confirmed stable with average demand of 137 units; inventory is currently being drawn down from peak summer surplus.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which has moved past its peak summer season (May-July) and entered a stable autumn demand regime. Since Period 25 (late August), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower baseline, averaging approximately 137 units per week (P25-P33 average is 138). On-hand inventory is currently 426 units with 146 units in transit (Total pipeline: 572). Given the stable lead time of 4 periods, we need to maintain a base stock that covers 5 weeks of demand (L+1). At the current average of ~138 units, the target base stock is roughly 690 units. Our current pipeline (572) is slightly below this target. The OR backend will attempt to bridge this gap, but since we are in a drawdown phase from previous overstocking, I will use recent_N=9 (covering the stable period since P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the system bases its order on the current autumn baseline rather than the historical summer peaks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirts has successfully transitioned from the summer peak into a stable autumn baseline. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 130.8 units, which aligns with the pre-game baseline. The most recent demand (P34) was 106 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stable autumn regime. On-hand inventory (320) plus in-transit (297) equals 617 units. Considering L=4, the pipeline covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. This is a comfortable position. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 4 periods throughout the game, so I will continue to use 'calculate' to rely on that consistent history. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-demand summer spikes.

Carry-over insight: Autumn baseline confirmed stable: Period 25-34 average demand is 130.8 units. The product has fully exited its summer peak seasonality.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) has fully exited its summer peak and is now in a stable autumn baseline regime. Demand from Period 25 to Period 35 averages approximately 126 units per period, with recent demand (P34-P35) slightly lower at 95.5 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 235 units, and in-transit inventory is 391 units (total 626). Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent baseline average of ~126 units, the required base stock is approximately 630-650 units. Since current pipeline (626) is very close to this requirement, the OR backend should maintain small replenishment orders to match the current consumption rate. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering P25-P35) to capture this post-summer baseline for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, which has moved past its summer peak and is now in a stable autumn baseline. Demand has significantly decreased and stabilized. Recent demands (P34-P36) were 106, 85, and 84, showing a further softening compared to the earlier autumn average. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is 101.4. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this most recent downward trend and avoid over-ordering as we enter the cooler months. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (166) plus current In-transit (446) is 612 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~101/period), suggesting a healthy but sufficient pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift downward confirmed for October: P34-P36 average demand dropped to ~92 units, a ~30% decrease from the September autumn baseline (~137).

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Tilly T-shirt continues its seasonal decline as we move deeper into autumn. Recent demand for Periods 34-37 has averaged approximately 96 units, confirming the downward shift noted in the carry-over insights. Total inventory (On-hand: 188 + In-transit: 315 = 503) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time and review period (roughly 5 periods * 96 units = 480 units). Given the $1.00 holding cost and the clear downward trend, the strategy is to allow current inventory to draw down further to avoid excess holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower late-October demand regime (~96/period) and maintain L at default (4) as lead times remain stable. No new order will likely be triggered by the OR backend given the current pipeline state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed for October: P34-P37 average demand is 96 units, reflecting a ~27% decrease from the September baseline of ~131 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight women's T-shirt (610776002) is currently in a lower autumn regime (approx. 90-100 units/period) following the high summer peak. In Period 38, demand was 78 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 92.4. Carry-over insights confirm this downward shift for October. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36, P33 order arrived P37, P34 order arrived P38). Current On-hand is 261, and In-transit is 167 (P35:94, P36:70, P38:3). Total inventory (428) is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current rate (92.4 * 5 = 462). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the approaching end of the game (Period 47), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P34-P38) to reflect the current autumn baseline. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. Lead time is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P34-P38) average confirmed at 92.4 units, representing a stable late-season baseline (~30% lower than September). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a stable late-autumn demand regime. Following the summer peak and a subsequent decline through September and October, demand has stabilized at a lower baseline. The most recent regime (P34-P39) shows an average demand of 87.2 units, which is a further reduction from the September 'autumn' baseline of ~131 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (294) combined with in-transit units (134) is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of current demand levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this lower late-season demand level (avg ~87) and sigma_hat with recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. This will prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P34-P39): Average demand has stabilized at ~87 units, approximately 35% lower than the early autumn baseline. Inventory levels are being managed down accordingly.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight women's T-shirt (610776002) has stabilized in a late-autumn regime. The last 7 periods (P34-P40) show an average demand of 84.6 units, reflecting a clear end to the summer/early-autumn seasonality. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this current baseline (~85 units/period). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory (295) plus in-transit stock (106) is currently high relative to the low demand, so the OR backend should naturally reduce order quantities as we approach the end of the year. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn baseline stabilized: Period 34-40 average demand is 84.6 units (~40% lower than the Sept baseline), reflecting stable off-peak demand for jersey basics.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776002 is a women's jersey t-shirt nearing late November (Period 42). Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P35-P41), demand has consistently been low, averaging 79 units, which is significantly down from the early-autumn baseline (~130) and summer peak (~450). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (228) and in-transit units (162) are sufficient to cover current demand levels, as the sum of on-hand and pipeline (390) significantly exceeds the projected\u9700\u6c42 for the (L+1) window (approx 5 * 80 = 400). I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime. L is set to calculate as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime stabilized: P35-P41 (last 7 samples) average demand is 79.0 units, representing the product's winter baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its winter baseline period (December). Demand has stabilized at a low level compared to the summer peak. The latest demand sample (P42) shows 109 units, which is slightly higher than the previous weeks but consistent with a stabilized low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (P35-P42), the average demand is approximately 83 units per period. The lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P43-P47), and given the lead time of 4, orders placed now will arrive in P47, the final period. The current total inventory (On-hand: 122 + In-transit: 195 = 317 units) covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate (317 / 83 \u2248 3.8 periods). To avoid overstocking at the end of the game and minimize holding costs while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining periods, I will use a conservative recent_N approach. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the late-autumn/early-winter stability (P36-P42).

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline demand confirmed: Period 36-42 average demand is ~86 units, representing the steady-state off-peak demand for this jersey basic.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1)' is currently in its winter demand baseline. Analyzing the most recent data (P36-P43), the average demand is 82.8 units per period. The recent_N method with N=8 is selected for mu_hat to capture this stable winter regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P42 (ordered P38) and P43 (ordered P39). Inventory levels are being managed to maintain a lean position during this off-peak period. With 122 units on-hand and 249 in-transit, there is sufficient pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods) at the current demand rate (~414 units needed vs ~371 available/in pipeline). The OR backend will slightly increase ordering as the pipeline clears to maintain the base stock level for the current winter demand and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline demand confirmed: Period 36-43 average demand is 82.8 units, representing stable off-peak demand for this jersey basic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the product has stabilized at a winter baseline. Over the last 9 periods (P36-P44), the average demand is 78.7 units. The most recent demand (P44) was 55 units, and P43 was 61 units, confirming a low-level steady state as we approach year-end. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 109 units with 272 units in-transit. A significant portion of the in-transit (56 units from P41) is expected to arrive this period (P45). To maintain a lean inventory while preventing stockouts during this stable low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (the detected winter regime) and use the standard lead time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline demand regime (P36-P44) is stable at an average of ~79 units per period, representing the lowest seasonal point for this jersey basic.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1)' is a women's jersey basic currently in its winter demand baseline. We are at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), just before Christmas. Historically, demand for staples like this has stabilized at a lower level following the summer peak and autumn decline. In the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is 78.0 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. The most recent demand (P45) was 64 units. On-hand inventory is 101 units with 258 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable winter regime (~390 units for 5 periods) and sigma_hat with the same N to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures sufficient stock for the winter baseline while avoiding excess inventory as we move toward the final periods of the game.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' is in its winter low-season. Demand has stabilized at a low baseline, with an average of 77.2 units over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). The most recent demand was 92 units in P46 (Christmas week), which is slightly higher than the previous weeks due to holiday shopping but still very low compared to the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 45 and 279 units in-transit (P43-P46 orders), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering roughly the period since late October) to capture the current winter regime (avg ~75-80 units) for forecasting mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the stable, low-demand winter period.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline demand (P36-P46) average is ~81 units. Demand in P46 showed a minor holiday lift (92 units) but remains within the established winter regime.
