Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Historically, demand over the last 5 periods has been [148, 175, 160, 233, 308], showing a clear upward trend (regime shift or seasonal growth). The mean of these 5 samples is 204.8, but the most recent sample (308) is significantly higher. Given the promised lead time (L=2), we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent acceleration (avg of 160, 233, 308 = 233.67) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU 610776002 is a women's everyday T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the order placed in Period 1 (343 units) has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 148, 175, 160, 233, 308, and most recently 266 in Period 1. The average of the last 3 periods (233, 308, 266) is approximately 269. Given the upward trajectory from the early historical samples, I will use a recent window (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime without being overly influenced by the much lower initial samples (148-160). I will use the default lead time (2), as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Current history shows a clear upward trend in demand: [148, 175, 160, 233, 308] (pre-game) followed by recent observations of 266 and 316. This suggests a demand regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. The average of the last 3 periods is approx 297. Promised lead time is 2, but Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (actual L=1). However, since lead times can drift, I will use L=2 to be safe while acknowledging the faster arrival. I'll use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent high-demand level (approx 300 units/period) and recent_N=3 for volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the increased variance in this higher regime. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Last 3 periods average 296.7 units vs historical ~200. Lead time for first order was 1 period despite promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current demand is significantly higher than historical samples, with the last 3 periods averaging 296 (266, 316, 306) compared to the initial history of ~200. This confirms a sustained demand regime shift. Regarding lead time, the P1 order arrived in P2 (LT=1), which is shorter than the promised LT=2. However, the P2 order (331 units) did NOT arrive in P3. If LT was 1, it should have arrived. This suggests the actual lead time is likely the promised 2 periods (or longer), making the P1 arrival an anomaly or indicative of variability. I will set L to 2 to be safe. Since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have 672 units in-transit (P2 and P3 orders), the OR backend needs to cover the current period plus lead time (3 periods of demand). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~200 to ~296 (N=3). Lead time variability observed: P1 order was LT=1, but P2 order exceeded LT=1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current demand is in a high regime, with the last 4 periods (P1-P4) averaging 292.75 units, significantly higher than the provided historical mean (~204). The latest demand (P4) was 283. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and there is a massive stockout (0 units sold in P4). We have 927 units in transit (ordered in P2, P3, and P4). Lead time is a concern: The P1 order arrived in 1 period (LT=1), but the P2 order (331 units) is now overdue if LT=1 was the new norm, or due now if LT=2 (promised). Because P3 conclude showed arrived=0 for the P2 order, and P4 conclude also shows arrived=0, the P2 order (ordered P2) has now taken at least 2 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~293 units/period. The total 1+L demand coverage will be ~879 units, which should be satisfied by the 927 units in transit once they arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-4 average 292.8 units (+43% vs history). Lead time is inconsistent: P1 was LT=1, but P2 order is taking \u2265 2 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Current demand (Periods 1-5) averages 284.6 units, significantly higher than the pre-game history (~204). The demand appears stable in this new regime (266, 316, 306, 283, 252). Lead time is volatile: P1 arrived in 1 period, while P2 arrived in 3 periods (promised is 2). This inconsistency suggests we should use a lead time estimate of 2-3. I will use L=2 (promised/average) but set mu_hat based on the recent higher demand regime (N=5) to ensure the base stock covers the current sales velocity. In-transit is currently 596 (orders from P3 and P4), and on-hand is 79. With L=2, mu_hat needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 285 = 855). The pipeline is 675 (79+596), so the backend will order approximately 180 units to reach the target.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 (LT=1), P2 (LT=3). Average LT is 2, matching promised, but arrival timing is unreliable. Demand regime stable at ~285 units/period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1) T-shirt' is a 'Womens Everyday Basic', showing stable demand. Current context: Date is 2019/3/25. Historical demand since the game started (Periods 1-6) averages 282.17 units (266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270), which is significantly higher than the initial pre-game samples (avg ~204). The lead time is volatile: P1=1, P2=3, P4=2 (Average = 2). Order P3 (341 units) is currently overdue (placed 4 periods ago), which might be a lost shipment or a significant delay. This is reflected in the large 'In-transit' figure (559 = P3: 341 + P6: 218). To protect against the possible loss of P3 and the high demand regime, I will set L to the promised 2 (matching the average), mu_hat using the last 6 periods of game data (N=6), and sigma_hat using the same period to capture the recent volatility. This ensures the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~846 units).

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (341 units) is now 2 periods past promised lead time; monitoring for potential loss. Demand regime stable at ~282 units/period since Period 1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's t-shirt in April, entering the Spring/Summer season. Since the start of the simulation (Period 1-7), demand has averaged 293.8 units, significantly higher than the initial history of ~204. Period 7 saw a spike to 364 units, likely due to seasonal warming. Inventory is currently 0 with 819 units in transit. Crucially, the order from Period 3 (341 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2), suggesting it is lost. If that shipment is lost, the effective pipeline is only 478 units (orders from P6 and P7). To account for the risk of lost shipments and the observed higher demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high demand since Period 1. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced (avg of 1, 3, 2 is 2), while knowing that the OR backend's safety stock logic will need to cover the higher variance and potential losses.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (341 units) is now 4 periods past order date (2 periods past promised arrival) and is likely lost, creating a significant inventory gap. Average demand since Period 1 is 293.8 (+44% vs initial history).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current context is Period 9 (2019/04/08). We are managing a basic T-shirt with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. Analyzing history, we observe a sustained demand regime shift from an initial average of ~200 units to a significantly higher mean. Since Period 1, the demand sequence is [266, 316, 306, 283, 252, 270, 364, 372], with an average of ~303.6 units. Lead times have been volatile: P1 order (LT=1), P2 (LT=3), P4 (LT=2), P6 (LT=2). Most critically, the order from Period 3 (341 units) is now 5 periods past its order date (3 periods past promised) and has not arrived; following the logic for lost shipments, we must assume these units are lost. This loss has created a stockout (on-hand = 0). To recover, I need to signal a high base stock. I will set L to 'default' (2) as the average of observed LTs (1, 3, 2, 2) is 2. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~304) across (L+1)=3 periods. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (341 units) is officially confirmed as lost after 5 periods of non-arrival. Current demand regime since Period 1 is stable at a much higher mean of ~304 units/period compared to pre-game data (~200).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's T-shirt (everyday basic). Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a clear demand shift starting from Period 1: the pre-game mean was ~204, but the average since Period 1 is 300.2 units (n=9), indicating a sustained higher demand regime. Lead time is volatile (L=1, 3, 2, 2) but averages to the promised 2 periods. Critically, the order from Period 3 (341 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is confirmed lost as noted in previous carry-over insights. This loss has caused frequent stockouts (OH=0). In-transit inventory consists of orders from P7 (260 units) and P9 (376 units). Given the target cycle service level q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.80, and the sustained demand shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the higher mean and variance observed since Period 1. I will use L=default (2) because while volatile, the recent successful arrivals (P6 and P8) adhered to the promised lead time of 2.

Since Period 1, the demand has shifted significantly upward from the pre-game average of ~200 to a mean of approximately 301 units per period (last 10 periods). Period 10 shows a stockout (on-hand 0) with a demand of 310, confirming high velocity. Inventory management is struggling due to the lost shipment from Period 3 (341 units) and lead time variability (observed LT ranges from 1 to 3 periods). The pipeline currently has 977 units (from orders in P7 and P9). Using L=2 (promised) is reasonable given the historical average, but I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the higher demand regime established during the game. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility observed during this higher-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~300 units/period (Periods 1-10 average 301), significantly higher than the initial historical average of 200.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (late April), we observe a significant demand spike in Period 11 (564 units), which is likely a seasonal surge for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' as spring transitions to summer. The mean demand from Periods 1-10 was ~300 units, but Period 11's 564 units suggest a new regime or a peak. Current on-hand inventory is 0. There are 601 units in-transit (from orders in Period 7 and potentially others not yet concluded). However, the Period 7 order (260 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, similar to the Period 3 order. Only recent orders are reliable. To capture the recent spike while acknowledging it might be an outlier or the start of a peak, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to increase the forecast above the 300-unit baseline, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods on average, so I will use the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 11 (564 units), suggesting seasonal transition for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Demand regime shifted from ~300 to a potential peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is entering a high-demand phase (May/Spring/Summer). In Period 11, demand spiked to 564, and Period 12 followed with 424. The average demand for these last two periods is 494 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~300. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 1,163 units in transit (including 260 from Period 7, which is likely lost, and 562 from Period 12). Since Period 3's shipment (341 units) was officially lost and Period 7's shipment (260 units) is now 5 periods overdue, I will treat only the recent orders as reliable pipeline. To account for the seasonal shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture the new high-demand regime (approx 494/period). For L, although one shipment was lost and lead times vary between 1 and 3, the promised lead time of 2 remains the most frequent observation for successful deliveries (Period 4, 6, and 9 all arrived in 2 periods). The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11-12 average 494 units (+64% vs P1-10 average of 301). This coincides with May seasonality for Womens T-shirts. Period 7 shipment (260 units) is likely lost (5 periods past order date).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13, 2019). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand significantly spiked in P11 (564) and P12 (424), before a P13 reading of 304. However, historical gaps in stock (ending inventory=0 in P11, P12, P13) mean actual demand likely exceeds 'sold' units. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is 430.6. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this higher seasonal level (~430 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of ~1290 for the L+1 window. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2, as recent shipments (P6, P9) arrived in 2 periods, though we monitor for losses (P3 and P7 shipments). On-hand inventory is 0, and pipeline is high (1627 units), so parameters aim to maintain a high base stock to satisfy seasonal demand once arrivals stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to seasonal peak confirmed: P11-P13 mean is ~430 units, a 43% increase over the P1-P10 average of 301. Seasonal relevance for 'Womens T-shirts' in May is high.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' (May), with Period 11-14 demand averaging 430.75 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1627, but this includes potentially lost shipments from Period 3 (341 units) and Period 7 (260 units). However, the OR backend's cap mechanism is already conservative (mu/(1+L) + safety), and given the massive recent demand spike (P11=564), the pipeline needs to be robust. Lead time has averaged 2 periods (P4, P6, P9 all took 2 periods), matching promised. mu_hat is set to 1290 (430 * (2+1)) using the last 4 periods (P11-P14) to capture the seasonal peak. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this period.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for T-shirts confirmed: P11-P14 mean is 430.8 units, compared to P1-P10 mean of 301.0. Shipment from P7 (260 units) is 5 periods past order date and likely lost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (May/June). Demand for Periods 11-15 averaged 433 units, significantly higher than the initial average of ~200 or the mid-game average of ~300. Period 15 conclusion shows a 2-period lead time for the P13 order, confirming that recent arrivals are adhering to the promised 2-period lead time. However, two significant orders are missing: Period 3 (341 units) and Period 7 (260 units), both long overdue and confirmed as lost. A large order from Period 12 (562 units) is currently 3 periods old (placed P12, expected P14) and has not yet arrived, which is a concern. Despite the high in-transit total (1163), a large portion is tied up in that potentially delayed/lost P12 shipment. To protect against the current seasonal demand of ~430 units and lead time uncertainty, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the seasonal shift, and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility of the peak. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Seasonal peak demand for Womens T-shirts remains stable at ~430 units/period (P11-P15 average). Shipment from Period 12 (562 units) is now 1 period past promised lead time; monitoring for delay or loss.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' remains in a seasonal peak regime. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P11-P16) is 433.3 units, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~300. The order from Period 12 (562 units) is now 4 periods old (2 periods past the promised lead time of 2); historical context (Period 3 loss) suggests this shipment might be delayed or lost. However, total in-transit is 1163, which likely includes the P12 (562), P13 (arrived), and potentially earlier or later unrecorded orders. Given P12 is missing and on-hand is 0, we must ensure future coverage. I will set L=3 to account for recent arrival instability (P2 was LT=3, and P12 is currently late) and use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained seasonal peak demand of ~433 units. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock covering (3+1) periods of high demand.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 12 (562 units) is 2 periods past promised lead time; combined with the P3 loss, this indicates high risk of shipment loss or delivery instability for this SKU. Demand regime is stable at the seasonal peak of ~430 units/period (P11-P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant seasonal peak (June/Summer for Womens T-shirts), with the most recent demand hitting a record 640 units. The current demand regime (P11-P17) averages 462.8 units/period. The primary challenge is 'phantom inventory': the 'In-transit' total of 1732 units includes three likely lost shipments from P3 (341), P7 (260), and P12 (562), totaling 1163 units that will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1732 units from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset these losses. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the current demand (L+1 = 3 periods) while ignoring the lost units, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * 3) + Lost Units = (463 * 3) + 1163 \u2248 2552. This forces the system to recognize that existing pipeline inventory is insufficient. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the higher volatility seen during this seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 12 (562 units) is now 4 periods past promised lead time and is confirmed as lost, joining previous losses from P3 and P7. Total pipeline loss is 1163 units. Current seasonal demand regime (P11-P17) mean is 462.8 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date (2019/6/17) and historical data indicate we are in a high-demand seasonal peak for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts'. Since Period 11, the mean demand has risen significantly. The recent demand regime (P11-P18) has an average of 457.4 units/period, with high volatility (standard deviation ~101). Multiple shipments have been lost (P3, P7, and now P12), totaling 1,163 units. This persistent loss pattern creates a massive inventory gap that the OR backend cannot see. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the seasonal mean (~460 * 3 = 1380) plus a buffer for the lost pipeline (~1160), totaling ~2540 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (currently 2,711, which includes those lost units) from the base_stock, I must provide a mu_hat that forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. I'm setting mu_hat to 2600 to ensure we maintain a flow that accounts for current demand and potential future losses. L is set to 'default' as 2 is the standard, though reliability is low.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 12 (562 units) confirmed lost; third major loss (P3, P7, P12) totaling 1163 units. Seasonal demand peak (P11-P18) mean is 457.4 units/period, requiring aggressive replenishment to offset pipeline ghost inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is currently in a seasonal peak (late June). The mean demand since the spike in Period 11 (P11-P19) is approximately 455 units per period. The pipeline is currently heavily distorted by lost shipments from P3 (341 units), P7 (260 units), and P12 (562 units), totaling 1,163 units that will never arrive but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation used by the OR backend. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and the actual promised lead time of 2 periods, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand, approximately 455 * 3 = 1365 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (2749 units) from the base stock, a standard calculation would result in zero orders. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders, I am setting mu_hat to 4000 (roughly 1365 target + 2749 pipeline + safety buffer) and sigma_hat to 450 to maintain a high service level during this stockout-prone peak season.

The demand regime for the most recent periods (P11-P20) averages 440 units/period, with high volatility (standard deviation ~95). Inventory management is severely complicated by persistent shipment losses (P3, P7, and P12 confirmed lost, totaling 1,163 units). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count, which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it assumes they will eventually arrive. To counter this 'ghost inventory', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for (L+1=3) periods using the current mean (440) and adding a safety buffer (z=0.84 for a 75% service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), then adding the 1,163 lost units to the target. This ensures the backend emits an order large enough to cover demand despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I'll use N=10 for sigma to capture the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant pipeline data corruption: 1,163 units (from P3, P7, P12) are confirmed lost but remain in 'In-transit'. Demand remains at seasonal peak for July, averaging ~440 units/period (P11-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' remains in its seasonal peak regime. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P11-P20) is 399.4 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 446.8 units. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this peak while smoothing the recent volatility. The pipeline inventory is significantly corrupted by three lost shipments: Period 3 (341 units), Period 7 (260 units), and Period 12 (562 units), totaling 1,163 units. These 'ghost' units in 'In-transit' cause the OR backend to under-order because it believes they are coming. To compensate for this 1,163-unit deficit and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand at ~440 units/period, I am setting an explicit L=5. By increasing L, the backend's target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu) increases, effectively forcing the order size up to account for the lost stock without me having to manually calculate the units. Observed lead times are P1(1), P2(3), P4(2), P6(2), P9(2), P13(2), P18(3), averaging 2.14 periods; however, the explicit L=5 is a strategic override to fix the pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed pipeline data corruption: 1,163 units (P3, P7, P12) are lost but remain in 'In-transit' inventory. Demand regime remains at seasonal peak (avg ~440 units/period).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has stabilized around a seasonal peak of ~440 units/period (P11-P20 average) but showed a notable dip in the last two periods (P21: 232, P22: 238). This may indicate the end of the peak summer demand season or just temporary variance; however, the P11-P22 average is 406 units. Current on-hand inventory is 509 units. The most critical issue is pipeline data corruption: 1,163 units (P3: 341, P7: 260, P12: 562) are confirmed lost but still occupy 'In-transit' space in the OR backend's logic. Total In-transit is 3,400, but active valid shipments are only 2,237 (P17: 569, P19: 38, P20: 1,630). To force the OR backend to order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I am setting L to 4 (explicit). This increases the required base stock calculation. I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 samples (P11-P22) to capture the full seasonal peak while acknowledging the recent dip, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the high volatility seen in June (P17 demand of 640).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand summer phase, though recent demand in Periods 21-23 (avg 227) has softened significantly from the May/June peak (avg 430+). We must account for severe pipeline corruption: 1,163 units from P3, P7, and P12 are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR engine's pipeline inventory. Additionally, the order from P17 (569 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. Total 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline is 1,732 units (1163 + 569). To force the backend to place necessary orders despite this inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base stock for a (L+1=3) period window using the recent demand mean of ~300 (averaging the spike and the recent lull) and then add the 1,732 lost units to the target. Calculation: ((1+2) * 300) + 1732 = 2632. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (LT ranges 1 to 3). Sigma remains 'recent_N' to capture seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline loss updated: Shipment from Period 17 (569 units) is now 4 periods past promised lead time and confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is now 1,732 units (P3, P7, P12, P17).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has entered a post-peak decline. After a seasonal high (P11-P20 average ~440), the last four periods (P21-P24) show a lower, stable average of 222.25 units. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to N=4 to reflect this new regime. Regarding the pipeline, there is significant data corruption: shipments from P3 (341), P7 (260), P12 (562), and P17 (569) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,732 'ghost' units in the 3,400 In-transit balance. Additionally, the P19 order (38) and P20 order (1630) are now overdue (P20 is 4 periods since order, 2 past promised). To force the OR backend to order despite these 1,732 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for L. By setting L=15, the backend's base stock calculation (mu_hat * (1+L)) will increase sufficiently to overcome the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction in the logic (base_stock - pipeline), ensuring replenishment occurs despite the corrupted in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-seasonal peak decline confirmed. P21-P24 average is 222.3 units/period (-49% vs peak). Pipeline corruption total: 1,732 units (P3, P7, P12, P17) confirmed lost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has clearly exited its seasonal peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 208.6 units, a significant drop from the ~450 units seen during the May-June peak. We are now in a post-peak regime. Regarding the pipeline, the In-transit total of 3517 units is heavily corrupted by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P3 (341), P7 (260), P12 (562), and P17 (569) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,732 'ghost units'. Additionally, the large order from P20 (1630 units) is now 5 periods old (3 periods past promised lead time) and has not arrived; if this is also lost, the total pipeline loss is 3,362 units. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and only the P25 order (117 units) is likely 'live', we must assume the P20 order is lost to avoid a massive stockout in the coming periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new lower demand level (~209 units) and 'explicit' for L=2 to keep the lead time estimation grounded in reality despite arrival volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to post-peak: P21-P25 average is 208.6 units (-54% vs peak). Pipeline corruption total increased: P20 order (1630 units) is 3 periods past promised and presumed lost, bringing total ghost inventory to 3,362 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has transitioned from its seasonal peak (May-July) into a post-peak decline. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 182.6 units, significantly lower than the ~430 units seen during the peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this downward trend. There is extreme pipeline data corruption: shipments from P3, P7, P12, P17, and now P20 (1630 units) are all significantly past their lead times and presumed lost. The current 'In-transit' count of 3517 is composed of 3362 'ghost' units (P3+P7+P12+P17+P20) and a real order of 38 units (P19) and 117 units (P25). To force the OR backend to order despite the ghost inventory, I am using an 'explicit' L of 0 and a high mu_hat. However, because the backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and we have >3000 units of ghost inventory, the backend will likely not place an order unless mu_hat is set extremely high. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the ghost inventory plus expected demand to trigger a replenishment order for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption deepened: P20 order (1630 units) is now 4 periods past promised lead time and presumed lost. Total ghost inventory in pipeline is 3,362 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20). Demand regime continues to decline post-season, averaging ~183 units/period (P22-P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a post-summer demand decline. Recent demand (P21-P27) averages ~181 units, significantly lower than the seasonal peak of ~440. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 4080 is heavily corrupted by lost shipments: P3 (341), P7 (260), P12 (562), P17 (569), and P20 (1630) are all far beyond their promised lead times and are confirmed as lost. This accounts for 3,362 units of 'ghost' inventory. Actual viable pipeline is likely only the P25 (117) and P27 (563) orders, plus the small remainder from the P19 (38) order. To account for the backend OR engine's reliance on the total In-transit figure, I will set L to 'explicit' and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'explicit' to force an order that bridges the gap between zero on-hand and the actual demand needs for the next 3 periods (L+1), while ignoring the ghost pipeline. I estimate required base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~180 units/period * 3 = 540. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (4080) from base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap or ensure a replenishment order. Given the 'cap' mechanism, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-peak mean (~181) and adjust L to the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand decline confirmed: P21-P27 average 181.1 units/period (-59% from peak). Total ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 3,362 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) which will never arrive.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has clearly transitioned from its summer peak (~440 units/period) to a post-seasonal lower regime. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P21-P28) is 183 units/period, with the most recent 3 periods averaging 127 units. We must account for the massive pipeline corruption: shipments from P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20 (totaling 3,362 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they still appear in 'In-transit' (3,400 units). Subtracting the 3,362 lost units, the 'real' in-transit inventory is only 38 units (ordered in P19). With 522 units on hand and 38 units effectively in-transit, we have 560 units of coverage. Given the current demand regime (~130-180 units/period) and a lead time of 2-3 periods, 560 units is sufficient for approximately 3-4 periods. Therefore, the OR backend (which still sees 3,400 in-transit) will likely not place an order, which is appropriate for the current stock level and declining season. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak mean and recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime for T-shirts confirmed: P21-P28 average is 183.4 units/period, showing a steady decline from the ~440 summer peak. Pipeline corruption remains at 3,362 units lost (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20), rendering 'In-transit' figures mostly invalid for base stock calculations.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has transitioned into a post-seasonal cooling phase. The demand mean from Period 21 to Period 29 has dropped to 173.9 units/period, a significant decrease from the summer peak of ~440. Currently, on-hand inventory is 382 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 3,400 units is highly corrupted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments in P3, P7, P12, P17, and P20 (totaling 3,362 lost units). This means the actual functional pipeline is only 38 units (from P19). Since on-hand (382) already exceeds two periods of current demand (approx. 348), the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero order to bleed off excess inventory. I am setting L=2 (promised) and using N=9 (P21-P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime. This provides the backend with the correct statistical context to avoid over-ordering while ignoring the invalid pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime confirmed (Sept): P21-P29 average is 173.9 units/period. Pipeline data remains critically corrupted with 3,362 units of lost 'ghost' inventory (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens T-shirt) has transitioned from its summer seasonal peak (~440 units/period) to a stable post-seasonal regime. Over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), demand has averaged 171.0 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 237 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 3400 units is heavily corrupted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20), totaling 3362 units. Subtracting these losses, the actual pipeline is only 38 units (from P19, which is also extremely overdue and likely lost). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this false pipeline, I will set L to 0 and use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This effectively forces the model to treat the situation as needing immediate stock based on current demand, as the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) would otherwise result in zero orders. I am setting mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (171 * (1+0) = 171) and sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of that same period (~45).

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime confirmed: Sept average ~171 units/period. Pipeline data remains critically corrupted with 3,362 units of lost 'ghost' inventory (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has transitioned into a stable post-seasonal regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) is 131.4 units/period, down from the summer peak of ~440. Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 3400 units is critically corrupted due to multiple lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) totaling 3362 units. The 'effective' pipeline is likely near zero, but the OR backend's capped policy will see 3400 units in-transit and refuse to place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this ghost inventory. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the next (L+1) periods, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the target base stock needs to be ~515 units (representing roughly 3 periods of 170 units to be safe) plus the ghost inventory (3362), totaling ~3877. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit despite the fake in-transit numbers. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for sigma to capture the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime for T-shirts (Sept) remains stable at ~131-140 units/period. Pipeline data remains critically corrupted with 3,362 units of lost 'ghost' inventory (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) which are still counted as 'In-transit' by the system.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has transitioned into a post-seasonal (autumn) regime. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 32 is approximately 140 units per period. The system's 'In-transit' figure of 3810 units is critically inflated by 3362 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory from orders in Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20. Accounting for the recent order of 410 units in Period 32, the actual pipeline is effectively 448 units (38 order + 410 order), though the P19 order of 38 is likely also lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 3810 units in transit and refusing to order, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at the current demand rate (140 * 3 = 420). However, because the backend subtracts pipeline_inventory (3810) from the base_stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of ghost inventory (3362) to trigger a replenishment order that compensates for the physical inventory gap. Expected mu_hat = (140 * 3) + 3362 = 3782. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-seasonal demand stabilization at ~140 units/period (P29-P32). Pipeline corruption persists at 3,362 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20) with P19 (38 units) now also suspected lost after 14 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is Period 34 (late September), representing the post-seasonal trough for Women's T-shirts. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) at an average of 141.6 units per period, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~440. The 'In-transit' figure of 3400 is critically corrupted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P20, and P19), totaling exactly 3400 units. Since 'Pipeline Inventory' = In-transit + On-hand, the OR backend sees 3400 + 263 = 3663 units, which is far above any reasonable base stock for a demand of ~142. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for an 80% service level (z=0.84): Base Stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=2, mu=142, and sigma~10, Base Stock approx 440. To bypass the 3663 units already 'seen' in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the pipeline (e.g., 3800) to ensure a small replenishment order is triggered if on-hand drops too low, though with 263 on-hand and 142 demand, we are safe for ~2 periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and sigma to capture the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption remains at 3400 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) which are confirmed lost but still reflect in 'In-transit'. Demand regime for late September/October is stable at ~142 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has transitioned into a stable post-seasonal regime. Over the last 6 periods (P29-P34), demand has averaged 129.0 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~440. Currently, on-hand inventory is 157 units, which covers more than one period of expected demand. However, there is severe pipeline data corruption: the 'In-transit' figure of 3400 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20). Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), it will not place any new orders as long as it believes 3400 units are arriving. To bypass this and ensure the backend actually orders units when needed, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. My target base stock is (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock = (2+1)*130 + ~150 = 540. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to approximately (540 + 3400) = 3940. I will use L=recent_4 to account for the recent lead time variability (range 1-3 periods).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a post-seasonal decline phase. Demand has stabilized around 120-130 units per period over the last five weeks (P31-P35 avg = 122.8). The 'In-transit' figure of 3801 is highly misleading due to 'ghost inventory' from multiple lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20), totaling approximately 3400 units. To bypass this corruption, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'explicit' method based on the current observed demand regime (~123 units/period) and a lead time of 2. I will set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3*123 = 369. Sigma_hat is set to cover moderate volatility during this low-demand period. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of 3801 'In-transit' units would normally prevent any ordering; by using explicit values, I aim to maintain sufficient stock despite the system's incorrect pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-seasonal demand stabilization: P31-P35 average demand is 122.8 units/period. Pipeline corruption remains critical: ~3400 units are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) but still show as 'In-transit'.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a post-seasonal decline as we move into late October. The demand regime has shifted significantly from the summer peak (~440 units) to a much lower level. Over the last 5 periods (P32-P36), demand has averaged 111.4 units/period, with the most recent two periods dropping below 90. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (3801 units) is critically corrupted by 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20), totaling approximately 3400 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate the order, these lost units prevent the system from ordering. To counteract this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock level, effectively 'hiding' the ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to 4000 to cover the ~3400 lost units plus a safety buffer for the current (L+1) demand of ~300 units (3 periods * ~100 units). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time, which has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a post-seasonal low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 106.2 units. Pipeline data is severely corrupted with approximately 3,400 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) that remain in the 'In-transit' count but will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate the order, it will see 4035 units in transit and place 0 orders unless I intervene. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline. However, the capped policy (final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)) usually limits orders based on mu_hat. To bypass the ghost inventory while demand is low (~106 units), I will set mu_hat explicitly to a high enough value to trigger a replenishment order that covers the next 3 periods of actual demand (L+1), while acknowledging that on-hand is currently 0 and P35 (401 units) and P37 (234 units) are the only valid shipments potentially arriving soon. I'll use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Pipeline corruption verified. 3,400 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) are lost but persist in 'In-transit'. Demand regime stable at late-autumn lows (~105 units/period).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4th, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is past its summer peak and currently in a stable late-autumn low-demand phase. The last 8 periods (P31-P38) show an average demand of 110.3 units, with the most recent 4 periods (P35-P38) averaging 89 units. I will use N=8 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime while maintaining some buffer. Lead time has been volatile; though the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals have ranged from 1 to 3 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for potential delivery delays. The pipeline inventory (4,488 units) is extremely corrupted by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20 totaling 3,400 units). Additionally, orders from P35 (401 units), P37 (234 units), and P38 (453 units) are pending. Since the backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock, the presence of 3,400 ghost units prevents the system from placing new orders. To force an order and bridge the inventory gap while the on-hand is zero, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. My target base stock is approximately (L+1)*Demand + Safety = 4*110 + 100 = 540. However, to trigger any order, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and significantly higher than the 3,400 'In-transit' units the OR engine sees.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption confirmed: Total ghost inventory remains ~3,400 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) which are lost but still counted as In-transit. Seasonal demand for T-shirts remains at autumn lows, averaging ~110 units (P31-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-11-11. We are in the post-peak autumn/winter low season for a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt'. Recent demand (P35-P39) has stabilized at a lower mean of 83.4 units/period. The pipeline is heavily corrupted with approximately 3,400 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) that will never arrive but are still counted by the OR engine's 'in-transit' logic. To force orders despite this high ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the perceived (on-hand + in-transit) levels. However, we recently received a shipment from P37 (234 units) and have 173 units on hand. Orders from P38 (453) and P39 (59) are expected in the next two periods. The current on-hand plus expected arrivals (173 + 453 + 59 = 685) is sufficient to cover about 8 periods of current demand (~83 units). Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, and keep L at default to maintain stability while the overstock from the P38 order is absorbed.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (Nov 18) finds the SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' in its seasonal low, with recent demand (P36-P40) averaging ~80 units/period. The pipeline is heavily corrupted with 3,400 units of 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20) that will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend. To compensate for this, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' high value to force the backend to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Currently, on-hand is 104 units. The P38 order (453 units) is expected to arrive this period (LT=2). If it arrives, on-hand will be ~500; if it is lost, inventory will hit zero next period. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to bypass the ghost inventory while maintaining a low sigma_hat to reflect the current stable (though low) demand volatility. L is set to default (2) as recent actual lead times (P32, P37) have stabilized around 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in seasonal low: P36-P40 average is 80.2 units/period. Pipeline corruption remains at ~3,400 units of lost 'ghost' inventory (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' in late November. Demand is currently in a seasonal low, stable between 60-70 units for the last three periods (P39-P41). The 'In-transit' inventory of 4313 units is heavily corrupted by significant historical losses (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, and likely P35 and P38), totaling approximately 4200+ units of 'ghost' inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock, these ghost units prevent the system from placing new orders. To maintain service levels during this low-demand period, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current mean demand (~68 units/period). I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to match the promised lead time, as recent deliveries have stabilized near that mark. The presence of 37 units on-hand against a forecast of ~68 units per period suggests a stockout is likely before the next arrival, but the backend will not order due to the pipeline corruption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in seasonal low for late November: P39-P41 average 65.7 units/period. Pipeline corruption has reached critical levels with ~4,200 units of lost 'ghost' inventory (confirmed losses from P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20; suspected losses P35, P38) preventing replenishment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). The product is a Women's T-shirt, which is currently in a seasonal low following the summer peak. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 84.8 units. The main challenge is critical pipeline corruption: approximately 4,254 units are listed as 'In-transit', but most of these (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38) are confirmed or highly suspected lost shipments. Specifically, P38 (453 units) is now 5 periods old and P35 (401 units) is 8 periods old, both well past the promised 2-period lead time. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate orders, these 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders, resulting in frequent stockouts (On-hand is 0). To force the backend to place an order and bypass this ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds the current 'In-transit' total plus 3 periods of expected demand. Targeting a base stock of ~4500 units to trigger a replenishment of ~250 units (assuming cap allows) to cover the current demand regime (~85/period) for the next 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption remains the primary constraint: ~4,250 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38) are confirmed/suspected lost but still appear as 'In-transit'. Demand regime for early December is stable at seasonal lows (~85 units/period).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date is 2019/12/09. Demand remains in a seasonal low for December, with recent demand (P41-P43) averaging 79 units. Inventory situation is critical due to severe pipeline corruption. The 'In-transit' figure of 4528 units is dominated by approximately 4,250 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock target, it will not place new orders as long as these lost units are counted. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to values high enough to overcome the 4528 ghost units and trigger a real order. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~240 units) plus the 4528 ghost units, totaling approximately 4768. I will use the 'explicit' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to force this behavior. I will maintain L at the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption remains severe: ~4,250 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38) are lost but persist in 'In-transit'. Dec demand is stable at seasonal lows (~80 units/period).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), the SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is in its seasonal demand trough. Recent demand (P41-P44) averages approximately 73 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the severe 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Based on carry-over history, approximately 4,250 units from historical orders (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38) are confirmed or highly suspected as lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 4,811. Subtracting these lost units reveals a true functional pipeline of ~561 units (consisting of orders from P43 and P44). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand is low, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current regime (N=5, ~75-80 units/period) to allow the OR backend to place small, corrective orders if necessary, while acknowledging that the system's 'In-transit' count is significantly inflated by lost shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 46 (Dec 23), late December. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is at a seasonal low, with the most recent 5-period average (P41-P45) being 71.2 units. The primary issue is massive pipeline corruption: out of 4,811 units 'In-transit', approximately 4,250 are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 3, 7, 12, 17, 19, 20, 35, and 38. The remaining ~561 units from P43 and P44 are currently within or just past the promised lead time window (L=2) and may still arrive. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - on-hand - in-transit), the presence of 4,250 ghost units will block all automated ordering unless I manipulate the lead time (L) and mu_hat to create a base stock higher than the ghost inventory. To force a replenishment order to cover the current stockout (on-hand is 0) and winter demand, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) but use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 5200 (approx. 4300 ghost units + 3 periods of demand at ~300 to be safe). This 'inflated' mu_hat is a tactical adjustment to bypass the pipeline corruption block and trigger the OR engine to place an order despite the 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption remains severe at ~4,250 units (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38). Replenishment is blocked by ghost inventory; explicit parameter inflation is required to force orders.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter the final period (47) on December 30th, the demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' remains in its seasonal low, with a recent 5-period average (P42-P46) of approximately 76 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline remains critically corrupted with roughly 4,250 units of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P7, P12, P17, P19, P20, P35, P38). These lost units continue to prevent the OR engine's automated base stock logic from placing necessary orders. Although Period 47 is the final step, ensuring sufficient on-hand inventory to cover the current period's demand is vital. I am setting L to the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using an 'explicit' approach to override the pipeline corruption. By setting mu_hat to 6,000, I ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the ~5,123 units of visible 'In-transit' inventory, forcing the system to recognize a need for stock despite the ghost units. This protects against a stockout in the final resolution phase where demand occurs after the decision.
