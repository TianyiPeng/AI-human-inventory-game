The OR algorithm suggests ordering 275 units based on a base-stock policy. However, the moving 3-period average is now approximately 296, and the recent demand has peaked above 300 twice.

The OR recommendation of 196 units resulting in a total supply of 325 (129 on-hand + 196 order) is based on historical averages and the recent drop. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt and we are in mid-April, demand is likely to remain around the 330-350 range despite the Period 9 dip. I will increase the OR recommendation slightly to 220 units to provide a total available supply of 349, which better aligns with the recent 3nd-period average of ~336 and provides a small buffer for stockout protection (Critical Fractile 0.8) should demand return to the 360+ levels seen in late March/early April.",

My base-stock target for the current peak regime is approximately 450-500 units to avoid stockouts during summer surges.

Previous carry-over insights confirmed a regime shift beginning in June (Period 17) with a peak demand of 640. Recent demands have been 640, 419, 439, and 301. The average demand across these last four 'peak summer' periods is approximately 450 units. While Period 20 saw a dip to 301, July typically remains a high-demand month for summer basics.\n\nInventory & OR Baseline: We have 201 units on hand and 0 in-transit. The OR recommendation of 236 units is based on all historical data, which includes lower-demand spring periods, thus pulling the average down. Following the OR recommendation would mean targeting a stock level of 201 + 236 = 437 units. Given that the mean demand over the last 4 weeks is 450, 437 units is slightly below the recent average and risks a stockout if demand returns to the June average or spikes again.\n\nStrategy: I will adjust the OR recommendation upward to 300 units.

We are now in Period 28 (mid-August), and history shows a clear decline from the summer peak that occurred in June/July. The carry-over insights correctly identify several downward regime shifts, with recent demand falling from ~200+ units to the low 100s. Specifically, demand in the last two periods was 102 and 120. The current on-hand inventory is 134 units. The OR recommendation of 275 units is significantly overestimating demand because it uses a long historical average that includes the high-volume spring and summer periods. Given the actual lead time is 0 (as confirmed by every successful arrival in history), we only need to cover next period's demand. Based on the downward trend and the recent mean of ~111 over the last two periods, I expect demand to be around 100-120 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation of 313 units is significantly inflated because it heavily factors in the high-volume summer demand (which peaked at 640 units) into its long-term empirical average, failing to adjust for the clear winter seasonality. The SKU (610776002 - Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a low-demand winter phase. Over the last five periods (P42-P46), demand has averaged approximately 76 units (109, 61, 55, 64, 92). The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the heart of winter and unlikely to see a sudden surge in demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts. My goal is to maintain a service level for a mean demand of approximately 80-90 units. On-hand inventory is 34. To cover next period's demand (estimated at ~90) with a safety buffer while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period), an order that brings total availability to around 130-150 units is appropriate. Ordering 110 units plus 34 on-hand provides 144 units, which is ample for the current regime and significantly more efficient than the OR recommendation.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR recommendation from 313 to 110 units. The OR agent is over-influenced by summer peaks; current winter demand averages ~76 units, and 110 units plus current stock is sufficient for the current low-season regime.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime for mid-winter (December) has stabilized at a mean of ~76 units (P42-P46), confirming a sustained seasonal low for this lightweight jersey item.",
  "action": {
    "610776002": 110
  }
}
Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-winter (December) has stabilized at a mean of ~76 units (P42-P46), confirming a sustained seasonal low for this lightweight jersey item.
