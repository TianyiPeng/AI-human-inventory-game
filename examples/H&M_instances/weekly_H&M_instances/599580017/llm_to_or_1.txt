Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 599580017 (Timeless Midrise Brief), a swimwear product. The current date is February 25, 2019, which is the lead-up to the spring and summer swimwear season. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend over the last 5 periods: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213]. The most recent demand (213) is significantly higher than the average, indicating a seasonal acceleration. Given the product category and the calendar date, I expect demand to continue increasing. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we capture this growth while maintaining a buffer for the (L+1) = 3 period exposure window, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime [152, 129, 213] to prevent stockouts during the seasonal ramp-up. L is set to default as we have no observed lead time data yet.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/3/4). This is a swimwear product (Timeless Midrise Brief), and we are entering the spring season, which typically sees rising demand. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend: 61, 98, 152, 129, 213. The demand in Period 1 was 175, confirming strong interest. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because we just started, and a large order of 237 units is in-transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, we expect this order to arrive in Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. For Period 2's parameters, I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent upward trajectory while maintaining the promised lead time. N=5 is chosen to cover the available trend history. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand, helping to recover from the current stockout.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/03/11). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (including pre-game) shows a clear upward trend: 61, 98, 152, 129, 213, followed by P1 demand of 175 and P2 demand of 173. This suggests a seasonal ramp-up as spring approaches. Currently, we have 64 units on-hand and 226 units in-transit (ordered P2). In P2, the P1 order arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, whereas the promised lead time is 2. I will use L=1 for my calculations. For demand, the average of the last 4 periods (129, 213, 175, 173) is 172.5. To capture the recent higher demand level while accounting for the seasonal nature, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4 periods to cover the lead time plus review period (1+1=2 periods). Sigma_hat will also be based on these recent periods to account for the increased volatility observed in the ramp-up.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Current demand history shows [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173, 181]. We are in mid-March, approaching the peak swimwear season. Demand has shifted from early low values to a sustained level around 175-180 units over the last three periods. Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (actual L=1), while the promised L=2. However, the Period 2 order (expected L=2) has not arrived yet (placed P2, should arrive P4, visible P5). Inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 3. To recover and prepare for seasonal growth, I will use a recent_N window (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime and explicit lead time L=2 to ensure the OR engine covers the (L+1) window effectively. The cap in the backend will prevent excessive over-ordering while we wait for the pipeline (322 units) to land.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1 (observed P2/P3): demand increased from early season lows to a mean of ~176 (avg of last 3 periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (March 25, 2019). The SKU 599580017 is a women's swimwear bottom, which is entering peak season. Demand has steadily increased over the last 5 weeks: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] (Note: 'Past demands' provided in context are 61-213, while 'Game History' shows 175-200; combining these shows a clear upward trend). The mean of the last 3 periods is ~185. Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in P2 (L=1). The Period 2 order was placed 3 periods ago and has not arrived, nor has the P3 order. Promised lead time is 2. The lack of arrivals for P2/P3 orders suggests potential delays or logistics volatility. Current on-hand is 0, with 506 units in-transit (P2: 226, P3: 96, P4: 184). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the seasonal uptrend in swimwear and the high demand of 200 observed in P4. I am forecasting a mean demand of 210 per period. For mu_hat (1+L)*210 = 630. Sigma is set to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Swimwear seasonal uptrend started in March; mean demand increased from ~100 to ~190 (+90%) over the last 4 weeks.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a women's swimwear SKU in April, entering peak season. Demand is on a clear uptrend: [175, 173, 181, 200, 268]. The last sample (268) suggests the previous estimate of ~190 is now too low. I am setting N=3 for demand (mean ~216) to capture this acceleration. Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2. History shows P1 arrived in 1 period, while P2 arrived in 3 periods. This indicates variability. The order from P3 (96 units) is now at L=3 and has not arrived, and P4 (184 units) is at L=2. Total in-transit is 422 (P3+P4+P5). Given the stockouts (OH=0), I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the (L+1)=3 periods of rising demand. I'll estimate future weekly demand at 250 units to prevent further stockouts during this seasonal ramp-up. mu_hat = 3 * 250 = 750.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April seasonal surge underway; weekly demand increased from ~180 to ~268 (+48%) in the latest period. Lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1120.00

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (April 8th). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is entering its peak seasonal window. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: P1-P3 avg ~176, P4-P6 avg ~281, with the latest period reaching 376. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 458 units in-transit. Lead times are volatile: P1 took 1 period, P2 took 3 periods, P3 took 3 periods, and P4 took 2 periods. The average observed lead time is 2.25 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-growth phase, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the recent volatility and the risk of delayed arrivals. For demand (mu_hat), I am using an explicit forecast of 400 units per period (total mu_hat = (1+3)*400 = 1600) to proactively capture the April/May swimwear surge, as recent averages (281) are lagging behind the latest observation (376). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~88) seen in the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April seasonal peak for Swimwear active; demand grew from ~180 (P1-3) to ~376 (P6), a >100% increase. Lead time is volatile (range 1-3 periods, avg 2.25).

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-April (2019/4/15), which is the heart of the seasonal peak for Swimwear. Historical demand has surged from ~170 in early March to a peak of 376 in P6, though P7 saw a slight dip to 295. The demand regime for the peak season appears to be averaging ~300+ units. Lead times have been highly volatile, with observations of 1, 3, 3, and 2 periods (avg = 2.25). Currently, we are in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with a massive pipeline of 1004 units (from P5: 142, P6: 316, P7: 546). The OR backend must recognize that L+1 demand needs to be covered. Given the seasonal peak, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand to capture the shift from ~180 to ~300. I will set L to calculate to reflect the actual historical average (2.25) rather than the promised 2, helping to account for the delays observed in P5 and P6.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at seasonal peak: avg demand for last 4 periods (P4-P7) is ~285, compared to P1-P3 avg of ~176 (+62%). Lead time remains volatile (range 1-3, avg 2.25).

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in the peak seasonal period (late April). Historical demand has shifted from an average of ~176 in Periods 1-3 to ~285 in Periods 4-8, with recent spikes reaching 367. The current stock position is critical: on-hand is 0, and there have been no arrivals for two periods despite significant demand. Orders from Period 5 (142 units), Period 6 (316 units), and Period 7 (546 units) are in-transit (totaling 1004 units). Given the promised lead time of 2, the Period 5 order is now at L=4 (overdue), and the Period 6 order is at L=3 (overdue). Observed lead times have been 1, 3, 3, and 2. To account for current delays and the seasonal peak, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the pipeline covers a longer window. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the high-demand April regime (avg ~300 per period). Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility during the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant lead time volatility and delays confirmed: Period 5 order (L=4) and Period 6 order (L=3) remain undelivered as of P9 decision. April seasonal demand remains sustained at >300 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. We are at the peak of the swimwear season. Historical demand for the last four periods (P6-P9) has been [376, 295, 367, 477], averaging ~379 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline is currently 1,012 units, consisting of orders from P5 (142 units - overdue at L=5), P7 (546 units - L=3 as of now), and P9 (324 units). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 4+ periods with an average of approximately 2.6 across completed arrivals. The order from P5 is now 5 periods old and likely lost or severely delayed, which the OR backend won't account for automatically. Given the stockout in P9 (demand 477, sold only 316) and the seasonal surge (477 units is the new high), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1440. This reflects (1+L)*demand where L=3 (explicit estimate) and demand=360, providing a buffer for the recent 477 spike and potential lost pipeline units (P5 order). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to manage the high variance observed in late-April demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: late April demand surged to 477 (+60% vs seasonal avg). Lead time instability persists: P5 order (142 units) is 5 periods overdue and likely lost.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (early May). The product is Swimwear, which is currently in its peak seasonal demand period. Demand has shifted from ~180 (P1-3) to a much higher level, averaging ~403 over the last 4 periods (P7-10: 295, 367, 477, 468). Lead times are unstable: while the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times for completed orders have been 1, 3, 3, 2, and 3 periods respectively. Crucially, the order from P5 (142 units) is now 5 periods overdue and is likely lost. The order from P8 was 0 units. In-transit inventory consists of P9 (324 units) and P10 (484 units). Pipeline inventory (950) seems high, but given the lost P5 order and high current demand, we must ensure coverage for (L+1) periods. I will set L to 3 to reflect actual observed delays, and use a recent_N of 4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~400 units/period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: May seasonal peak for Swimwear active with mean demand ~400 units (avg P7-P10). Shipment from P5 (142 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods of non-arrival. Lead time remains consistently longer than promised, averaging 3 periods for recent arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak May season for swimwear (Period 12, May 13th). Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 387.8 units. Although P11 showed a slight dip to 332, the overall trend for May is strong. Lead time (L) remains volatile but has centered around 3 periods recently (P5, P6, P7, and P9 had lead times of 3, 3, 3, and 2 respectively). The shipment from P5 (142 units) is confirmed lost, which the OR backend doesn't know, so I must adjust parameters to compensate for the inventory gap and the higher lead time. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival patterns. mu_hat will use the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (~388/period), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This configuration ensures the base stock (covering L+1 periods) is sufficient to handle the seasonal peak while accounting for the lost P5 order through the pipeline inventory logic.

Carry-over insight: Swimwear seasonal peak sustained: May demand averaging ~388 units (P7-P11). Lead time remains unstable but more likely 3 periods (observed 3 periods for 4 of the last 5 successful arrivals).

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late May seasonal peak for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Women's Swimwear). The current date is May 20th, a period of high demand leading into summer. The demand over the last 6 periods (P7-P12) has been [295, 367, 477, 468, 332, 417], resulting in a mean of ~393 units. This represents a sustained high-demand regime. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show [1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2] (P1-P11 orders), averaging 2.4. Order P5 (142 units) is confirmed lost. Order P10 (484 units) was placed 3 periods ago and has not arrived yet, confirming that L=3 is a more realistic expectation for planning than the promised L=2. To prevent stockouts during this peak, I will use an explicit L of 3 to account for the pipeline delay. For demand, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime (~393 units/period). This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the current high rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: May seasonal peak for Swimwear sustained with mean demand ~393 units (P7-P12). Lead time remains unstable, with 3 periods being the most frequent actual duration for recent successful arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019, which is the heart of the Swimwear season. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (P7-P13) has averaged 389 units/period, despite stockouts suppressing actual sales figures. The P5 order (142 units) is officially considered lost after 8 periods. Recent successful lead times have been 3, 3, 3, and 2 periods, making L=3 the most reliable estimate for safety. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 1553 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13). Given the critical stockout situation (on-hand=0) and high seasonal demand, mu_hat is set based on the average of the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the sustained peak demand level (~389 units/period). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=7 periods to capture high recent volatility. Using L=3 ensures the OR backend targets coverage for (L+1)=4 periods of demand, which is necessary given the demonstrated delivery delays and the product's seasonal peak.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd. We are in the peak summer demand period for Swimwear. Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime from Period 7 onwards, with a significant spike in the most recent period (525 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 422.4 units. Lead times continue to be volatile, but the modal actual lead time is 3 periods (P2, P3, P6, P7, P9, and P11 orders all took 2 or 3 periods; P13 took 1). The order from Period 5 remains lost. The OR engine needs to cover the current period plus the lead time (L+1). Given the seasonal peak and recent spike to 525, I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for frequent delays, and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1700 (which is (3+1) * 425) to maintain high service levels during this critical period. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (explicit) to account for the high variance observed in late spring/early summer demand (range 332-525).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Early June demand spiked to 525 units, significantly above the May average (~390). Lead time remains unstable but 3 periods is the most frequent duration for successful arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: The product is 'Womens Swimwear' (midrise brief). Current date is June 10, entering the peak summer season. Demand for P14 was 525 and P15 was 330. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 394 units. 

Inventory Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 1,705 units. Specifically, orders from P10 (484), P12 (448), P15 (631), and the tiny P13 balance are outstanding. The P10 order is now 6 periods since ordering, which is significantly longer than the typical 3-period lead time observed recently (P5 order was lost at P10, and P10 might be heading that way, but P12 and P15 are still within reasonable windows).

Lead Time: The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals (P11, P13) show 1-3 periods. I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P2, P3, P6, P7, P11 arrivals all took 3 periods).

Parameters: 
- L: Set to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent 3-period delay for most successful shipments.
- mu_hat: Using N=5 (P11-P15) captures the current June demand regime (~394/period). For L=3, this results in (1+3)*394 = 1576.
- sigma_hat: Standard deviation of last 5 periods is ~78. For L=3, sqrt(4)*78 = 156. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Early June demand continues to fluctuate around a mean of ~394 units (avg P11-P15). Lead time remains unstable, but planning for L=3 is necessary as 3 periods is the most common actual lead time for successful deliveries.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 17, peak season for Women's Swimwear. Demand in June (P14-P16) is averaging ~385 units, maintaining the high seasonal mean established in May. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed sales in the last two periods due to arrival delays. Looking at lead times: P11 arrived in 3 periods, P13 in 1, but P12 (ordered P12, 448 units) is now 4 periods overdue (should have arrived by P15 if L=3). Given P12 and P15 (631 units) are still in-transit, we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (1,716 units). Historically, P5 was lost after 5 periods of non-arrival; P12 is approaching that threshold. I will set L to 3 periods (the most frequent actual lead time) and use recent_N (N=6, covering the stable peak from mid-May to mid-June) for demand parameters to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high seasonal volume and the significant pipeline risk. The OR backend will see a large pipeline and likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the 1,716 units already committed.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand for Swimwear remains sustained at a mean of ~385 units (avg P14-P16). Pipeline reliability remains a major concern: P12 order (448 units) is 4 periods overdue, echoing the loss pattern seen in P5.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. The product is Women's Swimwear, currently in its peak summer season in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand remains strong but volatile, with a recent spike to 517 units in Period 17 and a 5-period average (P13-P17) of approximately 409 units. Lead time instability continues to be the primary challenge: the order from P12 (448 units) is now 5 periods overdue, following the same loss pattern as the P5 order. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1716 units (comprised of P10, P15, and P16 orders, excluding the likely lost P12 order). To account for the frequent 3-period lead times and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the high-season demand level (~409 per period), which results in a total look-ahead demand of (1+3)*409 = 1636. Given the pipeline is 1716, the backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero or minimal order this period, which is appropriate given the large amount of stock already in transit, while still maintaining high service levels for this profitable item.

Carry-over insight: P12 order (448 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods of non-arrival, matching the P5 loss pattern. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/7/1. SKU: 599580017 (Swimwear). The demand for Period 18 surged to 771 units, the highest in history, signaling a massive early July peak (likely tied to summer vacations/holidays). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has increased to ~489. Order for P12 (448 units) is officially confirmed lost (6 periods since order), and P16 (11 units) is now 2 periods overdue. In-transit inventory is 1182 (P15 order arrived, but P16, P18, and recent high-volume orders are pending). Lead time for successful deliveries remains consistently at 3 periods (calculated as the mode and mean of recent arrivals: P11->P14 (3), P13->P14 (1), P15->P18 (3)). I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the realistic delay. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the significant demand escalation (~489/period). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to account for the high volatility observed in the last month (range 302 to 771). This aggressive posture is necessary to recover from stockouts during the summer peak while accounting for pipeline unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July seasonal peak for Swimwear active; demand spiked to 771 units (+95% vs May average). Mean demand for recent regime (P14-P18) is ~489 units.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, the peak of the swimwear season. Period 19 demand spiked to 771, and Period 20's preceding demand (from the Period 19 conclude message) was 592, indicating a significantly higher demand regime than the May/June average. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 502 units. Lead time analysis shows a consistent pattern where successful deliveries typically take 3 periods (P11 arrived P14, P15 arrived P18), while some orders (P5, P12) are lost entirely. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1981 units (comprising orders from P10, P16, P18, and P19). Order P10 is extremely late and likely lost, similar to the P5 and P12 patterns. To account for the July peak and the unreliable lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~500 units/period). This results in a mu_hat covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July peak for swimwear is significantly higher than May/June, with mean demand rising to ~500 units (avg P15-P19). Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 3 periods, though the risk of total shipment loss (observed in P5, P12, and likely P10) remains a persistent threat to availability.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (July 15), the absolute peak season for women's swimwear. Demand has surged significantly in July, with Period 18-20 demands of 771, 592, and 542 respectively. The current regime mean (P18-P20) is ~635 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline (2336 units) includes orders from P16 (11 units, likely arrive P21), P18 (97 units, expected P21), P19 (799 units, expected P22), and P20 (355 units, expected P23). Historically, orders from P5, P10, and P12 have been lost (no arrival after 5+ periods), creating a 25% risk of shipment loss. To mitigate this and capture the July peak, I am setting L=3 based on the most frequent successful arrival time. I will use the recent 5-period demand average (P16-P20) which is ~545 units to forecast mu_hat. This targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio while accounting for the high volatility and potential for lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July seasonal peak for swimwear is significantly higher than May/June, with mean demand rising to ~635 units (avg P18-P20). Shipment loss pattern continues: P12 order confirmed lost; P10 (484 units) also confirmed lost after 10 periods of non-arrival. Pipeline reliability is the primary constraint.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: July 22nd, peak swimwear season. Demand analysis: The last four periods (P18-P21) show a high demand regime with an average of 603 units/period (771, 592, 542, 510). Although P21 showed a slight dip to 510, we are in the middle of the July peak. Inventory & Lead Time: On-hand is 289. Pipeline is 1664 units, but significant reliability issues exist. P10 (484 units) is now 11 periods overdue and confirmed lost. P12 (448 units) is also lost. The most recent successful arrival (P19 order in P21) had a lead time of 2 periods, but historical consistency suggests an actual lead time (L) of 3 is safer for base-stock calculations. Chosen Parameters: L=3 (explicit) to account for frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a buffer against the high variance and loss risk seen in history. mu_hat=2412 (explicit) based on (1+L)*603 to cover the review period plus lead time at the current peak demand level. sigma_hat=300 (explicit) to account for high demand volatility and the persistent risk of stockouts caused by shipment losses. This aggressive positioning aims to recover service levels during the high-profit summer window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July peak mean demand is ~600 units (avg P18-P21). Pipeline reliability remains critical: P10 (484 units) and P12 (448 units) confirmed lost. Successful lead times oscillate between 2-3 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the peak of the swimwear season. Recent demand (Periods 18-22) averages 625 units per period. The lead time analysis shows that while the promised lead time is 2 periods, actual successful arrivals (P19, P20) have recently hit the 2-period mark, though history shows a significant risk of 3-period delays or total losses (P5, P10, P12). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 2,021 units in-transit (P16, P18, P21, P22). Specifically, the P16 order (11 units) and P18 order (97 units) are significantly overdue (6 and 4 periods respectively) and follow the historical loss pattern; I am treating these as lost. The P21 order (127 units) is expected to arrive in Period 23 or 24. To ensure coverage during this high-demand July/August peak, I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period reality and setting mu_hat explicitly to 2500 (representing roughly 4 periods of 625 units: current + L) to maintain a high base stock and bridge the gap created by pipeline losses. This compensates for the 0 on-hand status and the unreliability of older in-transit orders.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed: mean demand has reached ~625 units (avg P18-P22). Pipeline loss pattern persists: orders from P16 (11 units) and P18 (97 units) are overdue by 4+ periods and likely lost, mirroring losses in P5, P10, and P12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $833.00

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (August 5), we are entering the tail end of the peak swimwear season. The product 'Timeless Midrise Brief' has shown strong demand throughout July, with the most recent demand being 309 (P23), following a peak of 710 (P22). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) is approximately 572 units. Lead times have been highly volatile and prone to total shipment loss (P5, P10, P12, P16, and P18 are missing/lost). However, recent successful deliveries show lead times of 2 periods (P19), 2 periods (P20), and 1 period (P22). Currently, 403 units are on-hand and 1,976 units are in-transit (P21 order of 127, P23 order of 667, and significant quantities from P19/P20 which may be duplicates or already accounted for in-transit totals). To maintain high service levels while accounting for frequent shipment losses and the seasonal peak, I am setting L=3 to cover the common delay period. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the high-demand regime of the last 6 weeks (mean ~572). sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: August demand starting to moderate from July peaks but remains high (P23 demand 309). Pipeline loss pattern persists: Orders from P16 and P18 are confirmed lost. Lead time for successful arrivals in July/August has improved to 1-2 periods, but 3 remains the safest planning horizon due to volatility.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12, 2019. The demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) is clearly entering a late-summer cooldown. Period 23 demand was 309 and Period 24 was 176, a sharp decline from the July peak which averaged over 600 units. In terms of lead time, recent successful arrivals have stabilized between 1 and 3 periods (P22: 1 period, P21: 3 periods, P20: 2 periods). However, the massive in-transit volume (2034 units) is primarily composed of orders from P23 (667 units) and P24 (185 units), along with any residual overdue items. Given that demand is dropping and we have 354 units on-hand with significant stock arriving shortly, the OR backend needs to recognize the downward trend. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the sharp decline from 710 to 176, and setting L=2 (the promised lead time) as the logistics have normalized compared to the mid-season chaos. Pipeline inventory is extremely high relative to current demand, so the capped policy will likely result in a zero order to prevent excessive holding costs during the end-of-season period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: August seasonal decline for Swimwear is underway. Demand dropped from a July average of ~625 to 176 in Period 24 (-72% from peak). Lead times have stabilized to an average of ~2 periods for the most recent three arrivals.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 26), and the swimwear category is experiencing a significant seasonal downturn. Demand has dropped from a July peak of ~600 units to a three-period average of 205 (P23-P25: 309, 176, 132). My objective is to avoid excess inventory as the season ends. On-hand inventory is 407 units, and there are 1849 units in-transit (orders from P23 and P25). While many in-transit units from previous periods (P16, P18) are likely lost, the recent orders from P22 (712 units), P21 (127 units), and P24 (185 units) have arrived with lead times of 1-3 periods, suggesting the supply chain for 'successful' deliveries has stabilized to an average of ~2 periods. Given the high pipeline of 1849 units (even if some are lost) and the rapidly falling demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand drop (N=3) and L=2 to align with the most recent delivery performance. The OR engine will likely order 0 units this period due to the high pipeline and low recent demand, which is the correct strategy to mitigate holding costs during a seasonal exit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: late August demand has declined significantly to a mean of ~205 units (P23-P25). Recent successful lead times have stabilized at an average of 2 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late August (Period 27), and the demand for swimwear has significantly declined from the July peak (>600 units) to an average of ~154 units over the last three periods (P24-P26). This confirms a seasonal shift as the summer season ends. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 919, in-transit: 1182), which is more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future, especially as demand continues to taper. Lead times have recently varied between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. Given the high stock levels and declining demand, the OR backend needs to prioritize minimizing holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend, and set L to 2 periods based on recent stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: late August demand has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of ~154 units (avg P24-P26), down from July peak of ~600. Recent successful lead times have averaged 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-224.00

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (Sept 2), demand for the Swimwear SKU has transitioned from its July peak (~625 units) to a stabilized post-summer low. The last four periods (P24-P27) show a consistent mean demand of approximately 150.5 units. On-hand inventory is 780 units, providing over 5 periods of coverage, which is more than sufficient for the inferred lead time. The 'In-transit' figure of 1182 units consists entirely of orders from P5, P10, P12, P16, and P18, which are confirmed lost or significantly overdue and should be ignored for planning. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current low-demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to calculate to reflect the actual historical average, which oscillates between 1-3 periods (avg ~2). Given high on-hand stock and low seasonal demand, the priority is to minimize holding costs by avoiding new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: September post-summer demand has stabilized at a mean of ~150 units (avg P24-P27), a 75% reduction from the July peak. Pipeline inventory (1182 units) consists of lost shipments and should not be counted toward stock availability.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (Sept 9), and the swimwear category is well into its post-summer seasonal decline. Recent demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has been [176, 132, 155, 139, 78], showing a clear downward trend and stabilization at a much lower mean compared to the July peak. The current mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 136 units. The on-hand inventory is 702 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 1182 units consists entirely of orders from P5 (142), P10 (484), P12 (448), P16 (11), and P18 (97) which are long overdue and confirmed lost in previous insights. Because on-hand inventory (702) already covers more than 5 periods of expected demand (approx 5 * 136 = 680), and we want to avoid excessive holding costs during the off-season, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples to reflect the lower demand. Sigma_hat is also adjusted via recent_N to reflect lower volatility in this stabilized regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed performance for the OR engine, though the high on-hand stock makes immediate ordering unlikely.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: September demand has shifted to a low-volume regime with a mean of ~136 units (P24-P28). On-hand inventory is currently sufficient for ~5 weeks of sales.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in July (~625 units) and has since undergone a significant seasonal decline as summer ends. The most recent demand figures (Periods 28 and 29) are 78 and 65 units respectively, confirming a low-volume autumn regime. The current on-hand inventory is 637 units, which is enough to cover approximately 8-9 periods of demand at the current average rate of ~71 units/period (P28-P29). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1182 units consists of historical shipments from Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, and 18 that are long overdue (6+ periods) and have been previously identified as lost. Therefore, these units do not contribute to actual stock availability. To prevent over-ordering during this low-demand phase and to manage holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P27-P29) to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (~94 units/period), and L to the promised lead time of 2. No new orders should be triggered given the high on-hand relative to the current demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime stabilized in September: mean demand has dropped to ~71 units (avg P28-P29), down from peak July levels. Pipeline inventory of 1182 units remains confirmed as lost/non-recoverable.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has entered a low-volume post-summer demand regime. The latest demand in Period 30 was 30 units, continuing the downward trend from 65 (P29) and 78 (P28). The mean demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 58 units. Current on-hand inventory is 607 units, which provides over 10 periods of coverage at current demand levels. The pipeline inventory (1182 units) is confirmed as lost/non-recoverable based on historical analysis of orders from P5, P10, P12, P16, and P18. Given the significant overstock relative to the current demand regime and the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), the primary objective is to avoid placing any new orders. To ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the low demand and keeping L at default (2). No additional stock is needed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: late September demand has dropped significantly to ~58 units (avg P28-P30), marking the end of the swimwear season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-432.00

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late September (Period 32), and the demand for swimwear has significantly dropped as the peak summer season has ended. The last four periods (P28-P31) show a clear low-demand regime with values of 78, 65, 30, and 35, averaging ~52 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 572 units, which is enough to cover over 10 periods of the current demand level. The 'In-transit' figure of 1182 is composed of historical lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and does not represent actual incoming stock. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low seasonal demand, no new orders are required. I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=4), and sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility of this post-peak period. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while we bleed down existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Swimwear reached a seasonal low in late September: mean demand has stabilized at ~52 units (avg P28-P31), representing a 90%+ decrease from July peak.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 33 (October 7th), well into the post-summer low-demand season for women's swimwear. Historical demand has plummeted from the July peaks of ~600+ units to a very stable low-volume regime. Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 54 units (78, 65, 30, 35, 62). Current on-hand inventory is 510 units, which at the current burn rate covers nearly 10 periods of demand. The in-transit inventory of 1182 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of lost shipments from earlier in the season (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and should be ignored for stock calculations. Because on-hand inventory is significantly higher than the required base stock for this low-demand regime, no new orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~54 units, and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the low volatility in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-320.00

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's swimwear bottom, currently in the post-summer off-season (mid-October). Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal decline: the July peak averaged ~600 units/period, September dropped to ~71 units, and early October (P32-P33) has stabilized at ~50 units. The current on-hand inventory is 472 units, which is approximately 9-10 weeks of stock at the current low demand regime (avg P31-P33 = 45 units). The in-transit inventory of 1182 units consists of historical lost shipments (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 18) and should be ignored for stock-level calculations. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to off-season demand and the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), the goal is to prevent any further ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the current low-volume regime and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the historically volatile lead times (avg ~2-3 periods). The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders because on-hand inventory significantly exceeds the required base stock for this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: October off-season demand for swimwear has stabilized at a very low mean of ~45 units (avg P32-P33). Pipeline inventory of 1182 units remains confirmed as lost/non-recoverable.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its off-season (late October), and demand has stabilized at a very low level. Recent demand for periods 30-34 shows values of [30, 35, 62, 38, 43], averaging approximately 42 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 429 units, which covers approximately 10 periods of demand at the current rate. The in-transit inventory of 1182 units consists of historical lost shipments (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 18) and should be ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory significantly exceeds the required base stock for the current regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this low-demand off-season regime and set L to default (2).

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of late October (Period 36), the swimwear season has concluded. Demand has stabilized at a low off-season mean of approximately 45-50 units per period (avg P32-P35: 48.25). Current on-hand inventory is 379 units, providing approximately 8 periods of coverage, which is more than sufficient given the low demand and high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0). The pipeline inventory of 1182 units consists of historical lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock calculation. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to reflect the low-volume off-season regime. No new orders are needed; the focus is on depleting existing on-hand stock to minimize holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear), currently in the off-season (November). Demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime since late September. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 45.8 units per period (62, 38, 43, 50, 36). On-hand inventory is 343 units, which provides over 7 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. The in-transit inventory of 1182 units is documented as lost shipments from earlier high-lead-time periods (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and should be ignored for planning. Given the high on-hand stock and low seasonal demand, no new orders are required. I am setting L to the default promised lead time of 2, and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the most recent 5-period off-season regime to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the current low-demand environment, though no order will be triggered due to high on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's swimwear bottom, currently in the deep off-season (November). Demand has remained consistently low and stable since late September. Over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), demand has averaged 43.8 units per week (min 34, max 62). On-hand inventory is 309 units, which covers approximately 7 weeks of current demand. The pipeline inventory (1182 units) is composed of historic lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and should be ignored for planning. Given the high stock-to-sales ratio and the seasonal trough, no new orders are necessary. The OR backend should be configured to reflect this low-demand regime to prevent unnecessary ordering while maintaining a high service level for the few customers still purchasing. We set L to the default (2) as recent actual lead times are no longer volatile for the small volumes involved. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the last 6 periods to capture the current stable off-season baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's swimwear bottom, currently in the off-season (mid-November). Historical demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime since late September. The mean demand over the last 7 periods (P32-P38) is approximately 43.5 units per period. Currently, there are 267 units on-hand, which covers approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate. The 1182 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (from P5, P10, P12, P16, and P18) and do not contribute to available stock. Given the significant overstock relative to current demand and the off-season timing, no new orders are necessary. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and standard lead time, allowing the OR backend to naturally deplete the existing inventory without placing unnecessary orders.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its off-season phase as of late November. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last 8 periods (P32-P39) being approximately 40 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 250 units, which covers more than 6 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1182 units is confirmed to be composed of lost shipments from earlier periods (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and should be ignored for stock calculations. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low seasonal demand, no new orders are required. I will set the OR parameters to reflect this low-demand regime using the most recent 8 periods to capture the current off-season mean and variance, ensuring the backend does not trigger unnecessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Late-year off-season demand confirmed: October and November demand for swimwear has stabilized at a mean of ~40 units per period (avg P32-P39), down from peak seasonal levels. Pipeline inventory remains unrecovered and should be treated as lost.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 41 (Dec 2, 2019). The SKU is a swimwear bottom, which is in its deep off-season. Recent demand (P32-P40) has stabilized at a low mean of approximately 48 units per period, although P40 saw a minor outlier spike to 113. With 137 units on-hand and an expected off-season demand of ~40-50 units, we have nearly 3 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1182 units is confirmed as lost shipments from earlier in the year (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and must be disregarded for inventory planning. The OR backend will subtract this phantom pipeline from the base stock calculation, likely resulting in no order, which is the correct outcome given our high on-hand levels relative to off-season demand. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most common lead time for successful deliveries, and use the last 9 periods (P32-P40) to define the current low-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Swimwear bottom, which is currently in its deepest off-season (December). Demand has stabilized at a low level; the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 51.4 units, with a spike in P40 likely related to late November sales events. On-hand inventory is currently 86 units. Given the lead time (L=2) and current period, the inventory must cover P42, P43, and P44. Current on-hand (86) plus any pending arrivals should be weighed against the expected demand of ~150 units for the next three periods. However, the in-transit inventory of 1182 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and should be ignored by the logic. Since 86 units on hand is less than the projected demand for (L+1) periods (~150), a small replenishment order is necessary. I will set mu_hat based on the recent low-season demand to avoid over-ordering during the winter, and use explicit lead time of 2 to reflect recent successful delivery patterns before shipments were lost.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/12/16 (Period 43). We are in the deep off-season for swimwear. The demand regime has stabilized at a low volume, averaging approximately 53 units over the last 5 periods (P38-P42: 42, 17, 113, 51, 57). Note that Period 40 saw a brief spike (113), but the surrounding demand remains low. On-hand inventory is 29 units, and 1182 units in pipeline are confirmed lost from much earlier periods (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18). With a promised lead time of 2 periods and a decision lead time of 1 (total 3 periods of risk), we need enough stock to cover roughly 3 * 50 = 150 units. Currently, on-hand (29) is insufficient. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals were 1-3 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current off-season mean of ~56 units/period (3 * 56 = 168). For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=5) will capture the recent volatility, including the P40 spike, to ensure the OR backend maintains a safe buffer without excessive holding costs for a low-margin period.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-12-23. We are in the extreme off-season for swimwear (SKU 599580017). Demand has been consistently low for several months, averaging approximately 45 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), excluding a single outlier in P40. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the 1,182 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (P5, P10, P12, P16, P18) and should not be considered available stock. My objective is to replenish stock to meet the current low-demand regime while avoiding overstocking as we approach the end of the year. The lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for recent successful deliveries. I will set L to 2. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable off-season demand mean (~45 units/period), which translates to a (1+L) requirement of approximately 135 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the low volatility of this regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30. We are in the extreme off-season for swimwear. Demand has stabilized at a low-volume regime since late September. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 52 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory of 1182 units consists of historical lost shipments (P10, P12, P16, P18) that are over 20 periods overdue and will not arrive. Therefore, new orders are required to meet demand. Lead time for successful deliveries during the latter half of the year stabilized at 2 periods. I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the stable lead-time period) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current low-demand off-season mean of ~52 units. This will trigger a small order to cover the (L+1) period horizon while minimizing holding costs during the low season.
