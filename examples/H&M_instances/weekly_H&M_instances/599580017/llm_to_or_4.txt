Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 599580017 (Timeless Midrise Brief), a swimwear product. The current date is February 25, 2019, which is the start of the spring/summer swimwear season. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], suggesting seasonal growth. Since we are at the beginning of the simulation and on-hand inventory is 0, we need to establish a baseline that captures this recent momentum. The promised lead time is 2 periods. I will use the most recent 5 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand level (approx. 130.6 units/period) rather than the all-time average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the (L+1) window effectively. I will stick to the 'default' lead time (promised L=2) as we have no 'conclude' messages to suggest drift yet.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/3/4). For SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear), the demand is showing a clear upward trend [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175], likely reflecting early spring/pre-summer seasonality. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 225 units; these are currently in-transit and, per the lead time definition, are expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived, resulting in lost sales (demand was 175 in P1). To capture the recent demand surge and prepare for the 2-period lead time (covering P2, P3, and P4 demand), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to focus on the most relevant recent growth, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 2 as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Given the date (March 11), we are entering the pre-summer seasonal ramp-up. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] (external) and [175, 173] (recent game history). The mean of the last 5 samples is 168.4. In Period 2, we observed an actual lead time of 1 period for the Period 1 order, which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, per instructions, we should be cautious about assuming this 1-period lead time is permanent. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat), since we see a significant increase compared to early historical data, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~172) while acknowledging the product's seasonal nature. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (March 18). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear), which typically sees increasing demand as Spring progresses toward Summer. Looking at historical demand [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173, 181], there is a clear upward trend from the initial samples to the recent periods where demand has stabilized between 170-185 units per week. The promised lead time is 2, but Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (L=1). However, Period 2's order (placed P2, expected P4) has not arrived yet according to the P3 conclude message. Since we are at the start of P4, that order should arrive DURING this period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 334 units in-transit (Orders from P2 and P3). To ensure we capture the spring seasonal climb, I will use recent_N=3 for demand (avg ~176) to reflect the current stabilized higher volume compared to the early historical data. Lead time will be set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed L=1, but the OR engine will still respect the promised L=2 for safety. Sigma is set to default as variance is relatively stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: avg demand increased from ~100 to ~175 starting around Period 1 and has sustained for 3+ periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). We are currently in late March, entering the pre-summer peak season for swimwear. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] (pre-history) followed by [175, 173, 181, 200] in the recorded periods. The last 3 periods average ~185 units. Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (L=1), which is shorter than the promised L=2. However, the Period 2 order (226 units) was expected in Period 3 or 4 (if L=1 or 2) but has not arrived as of Period 4 conclude. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 412 units in-transit (Orders from P2, P3, P4). The lack of arrivals in P3 and P4 suggests L is at least 2 or 3, or shipments are delayed. I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime (~182/period). This results in a mu_hat of (1+2)*182.25 = 546.75. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during the seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~180 (+80%) over the last 4 periods (P1-P4) coinciding with spring seasonality for swimwear.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (April 1st). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Historical demand [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] and recent observed demand [175, 173, 181, 200, 268] show a clear upward trajectory. The mean demand of the last 5 periods is approximately 199. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times have been 1 (P1 order) and 3 (P2 order), averaging 2. Current on-hand is 0 with 339 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P5). Since we are currently stock-out (ending on-hand 0 for 3 of the last 5 periods) and demand is increasing due to seasonality, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture this growth while setting an explicit lead time of 2.5 to account for the observed volatility in arrival times, ensuring the base stock level (L+1) covers the replenishment cycle plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: Seasonal growth confirmed for Swimwear; avg demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is 199 units, up from the initial history of ~130 (+53%). Lead time is volatile (1 to 3 periods).

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The SKU is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Demand has surged significantly: the last 5 periods show [173, 181, 200, 268, 376], with a clear upward trend. Period 6 demand (376) is a sharp increase. Lead times are volatile: P1 took 1 period, P2 took 3, P3 took 3, and P4 took 2. The average observed lead time is 2.25. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite 186 units arriving last period, as demand (376) far outstripped supply. There are 418 units in-transit (orders from P5 and P6). Given the rapid seasonal acceleration and stockouts, I will use a high N for mu_hat to capture the growth while dampening the single-period spike of 376, but I will explicitly set a higher lead time (L=3) to account for the recent delivery delays and ensure the base stock calculation covers a wider window to prevent further stockouts during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 6 (376 units); 5-period average is now 240 units (+20% from previous assessment). Lead time variability confirmed: ranges from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.25.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a swimwear brief, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand has shown a clear upward trend: historical mean was ~130, while the last 5 periods average 264.4. Period 6 saw a spike to 376, followed by 295 in Period 7. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 798 units (153 from P5, 265 from P6, 380 from P7). Lead times have been volatile: 1, 3, 3, 2. The average lead time observed is (1+3+3+2)/4 = 2.25 periods. Given the seasonality and recent demand levels, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current 250+ unit demand regime. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to account for the observed drift from the promised 2 periods to an average of 2.25. Sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. The large pipeline should eventually cover the backlogs, but high parameters are needed to ensure the base stock targets account for the sustained growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 5-period average (P3-P7) reached 264 units, representing a 100%+ increase over initial historical data due to peak swimwear seasonality. Average observed lead time is 2.25 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in peak demand season (April). Current demand shows a strong upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P4-P8) averaging 301 units, significantly higher than earlier periods. Period 8 demand was 367. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 798 units in transit (from P5, P6, and P7). However, no orders arrived in Period 7 or 8. Observed lead times have been 1, 3, 3, and 2 periods (average 2.25). Given the recent stockouts and rising demand, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent shipping delays and ensure the base stock calculation covers enough pipeline demand. I will use the last 5 periods for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime, and the last 5 periods for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand for Swimwear has reached a peak with a 5-period average (P4-P8) of 301 units, compared to the previous assessment of 264. Lead time remains unstable, with no arrivals observed in the last two periods despite significant orders placed in P5-P7.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Swimwear) is in its peak demand phase (April/May). Recent demand (P5-P9) has averaged 356.6 units, showing a significant jump from the previous 5-period average. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 955 units in-transit (orders from P7 and P9). However, lead times are volatile and currently trending toward 3 periods (observed lead times: 1, 3, 3, 2, 3). With L=3, we need to cover L+1 = 4 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period demand average (356.6) results in a mu_hat of approximately 1426 (356.6 * 4). Lead time 'calculate' will account for the shift from the promised 2 to the actual ~2.4 average. The OR backend's service level (75% for $4 profit/$1 holding) and capping mechanism will help mitigate over-ordering given the large pipeline, but we must ensure mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime to avoid persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand for Swimwear (P5-P9) averaged 356.6 units, up from P1-P5 average of 199.4 (+79%). Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for 3 of the last 4 arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/5/6). The product is Swimwear, currently in its peak seasonal growth phase. Analysis of recent demand (P6-P10) shows an average of 396.6 units, compared to the P1-P5 average of 199.4, indicating a sustained 100% growth since the start of the season. Stockouts have been frequent due to lead-time instability and high demand. Lead-time analysis of the last four concluded orders (P2, P3, P6, P7) shows actual lead times of 3 periods each, despite the promised 2. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 575 units in-transit (P9 and P10 orders). Using L=3 to account for the actual observed logistics delay. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*400 to cover 4 periods of demand at the current seasonal peak rate of ~400 units/period. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility associated with the current demand level, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P6-P10) has increased to 396.6 units (up from 356.6 in the previous assessment). Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods for the last 4 concluded shipments.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/05/13), placing the product (Women's Swimwear) in its peak demand season. Demand has significantly increased, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 387.8 units, compared to the initial historical mean. Period 11 saw a slight cooling (332 units) compared to the late April spikes (>450), but demand remains high. Lead time analysis: Recent arrivals (P10, P11) arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively. The average of the last four concluded lead times (P6, P9, P10, P11) is (3+3+3+2)/4 = 2.75. Since the backend treats L as an integer or effective period count, setting L to an explicit value of 3 accounts for the observed trend of 3-period arrivals and provides a safety buffer against the volatility seen in April. For demand (mu_hat), a recent_N of 5 periods (P7-P11) captures the sustained high-volume regime while reflecting the most recent data point. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with these peak demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in peak seasonal regime: 5-period average (P7-P11) is 387.8 units. Lead time has averaged 2.75 periods over the last four arrivals, with 3 periods being the most frequent observation.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (May 20), we are in the heart of the peak swimwear season. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 412.2 units, indicating a plateau at a high level. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are entirely dependent on incoming shipments. Analysis of the 1201 units in-transit reveals: 526 units (ordered P11) and 522 units (ordered P12), plus a likely lost shipment of 153 units from Period 5. Excluding the lost shipment, the pipeline is 1048 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.6 over the last five successful arrivals. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent volatility and to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer risk horizon (L+1 = 4 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand plateau (~412 units/period). This strategy aim to maintain a high service level to capture peak season profits while acknowledging that shipments may take 3 periods to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in late May: 5-period average (P8-P12) is 412.2 units. Shipment from Period 5 (153 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed since order).

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 27, 2019), the SKU is in its peak seasonal demand phase for Women's Swimwear. The 5-period average demand (P9-P13) is 412.8 units, reflecting a sustained high-demand regime since late April. Observed lead times over the last 5 successful arrivals were [3, 3, 3, 3, 2], confirming an actual lead time of approximately 3 periods, despite the promised 2. A shipment from Period 5 is officially confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). There is currently zero on-hand inventory and 1,717 units in-transit (from orders in P11, P12, and P13). Using N=5 for demand and lead-time calculations captures the most recent peak seasonal performance. The backend's base-stock calculation will now account for the (L+1)=4 periods of demand required to bridge the gap until the next possible arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at peak seasonal levels (May): 5-period average (P9-P13) is 412.8 units. Lead time remains consistently 3 periods (4 out of last 5 arrivals).

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (early June). The demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 422.4 units, representing a significant increase from earlier months. In Period 14, we received two large shipments (from P11 and P13), resulting in a high ending on-hand inventory of 517 units. Regarding lead times, the 'conclude' messages show actual lead times of 3, 2, 0 (N/A), 3, and 1 over the recent arrivals. The most frequent lead time recently is 3, though Period 13 arrived in just 1 period. The shipment from Period 5 is officially confirmed lost. Given the current high inventory (517) and units in-transit (675), the total pipeline of 1192 units is substantial. I will set L to 3 (recent mode/mean) and mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the current plateau. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during the peak season. This ensures we don't over-order while maintaining a high service level for the $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for peak swimwear season (June): 5-period average (P10-P14) is 422.4 units. Actual lead time remains volatile but averages ~2.5-3 periods excluding outliers.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10, representing peak swimwear season. Demand analysis of the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 332, 417, 370, 525, 330) shows a mean of 394.8, which is slightly lower than the May peak but still significantly high. The demand volatility (sigma) is elevated due to significant weekly swings (330 to 525). Lead time analysis: Recent arrivals (P14) showed lead times of 3 periods and 1 period, respectively. The average of the last 4 arrivals (P9, P10, P11, P14) is (3+3+2+3+1)/5 = 2.4 periods. Given the high stockout risk during peak season and the P5 shipment loss, I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current June plateau and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for recent high variance. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the full observed history which reflects an average between 2 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for June peak swimwear season: 5-period average (P11-P15) is 394.8 units. Lead time remains unstable with a recent 1-period arrival (P13 order) contrasting with the typical 3-period trend.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17, middle of the peak season for Swimwear. Historical demand shows a seasonal climb peaking in May (P14-P15) and showing signs of a slight cooling or plateau in June (P15: 330, P16: 302). The 5-period average (P12-P16) is 348.2, significantly lower than the previous May peak average (~412). On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 1224 units (including orders from P12, P15, and possibly late units). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.4 over recent concluded orders. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and high 'In-transit' balance (1224 units against a 5-period demand forecast of ~350), the system likely has enough in the pipeline to cover the next 3 periods of demand if they arrive as expected. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the slight downward trend/plateau in June demand, and set L to 'calculate' to account for the erratic arrival history (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand began cooling/plateauing in mid-June: 5-period average (P12-P16) dropped to 348.2 units from the May peak of 412.8 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 24), demand for this swimwear SKU remains high but volatile, with a recent spike to 517 units in Period 17. The 5-period average (P13-P17) is 408.8 units. We are likely at the peak of the summer season before a late-summer decline. Lead times are highly unstable: while the promised L=2, recent observations show arrivals ranging from 1 to 3 periods, and the order from Period 12 (522 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost. The order from Period 15 (549 units) is currently at 3 periods and is expected to arrive soon. Total in-transit inventory is 1224 units, but excluding the likely lost P12 shipment, the effective pipeline is 702 units. To account for the high variability in both demand and lead time, I am setting L to 3 to provide a larger buffer (covering 4 periods of demand). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~409), and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (std ~104). This ensures the OR backend targets a stock level that accounts for the likely loss of older shipments and the instability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late June: Period 17 demand (517) spiked after two periods of decline. Shipment from Period 12 (522 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed). Effective lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. We are in the peak-to-late summer season for 'Womens Swimwear'. Demand has become extremely volatile with a significant spike of 771 units in Period 18, likely representing a late-season surge or stock-out recovery demand. The 5-period average (P14-P18) is approximately 450 units, but the high variance makes simple averaging risky. Regarding inventory, the shipment from Period 12 (522 units) is now 7 periods old and officially considered lost, which explains the ongoing 'On-hand: 0' status. The current 'In-transit' of 1257 units consists of the lost P12 order (522), the P18 order (582), and potentially some lingering units from previous discrepancies. To address the lost shipment and high demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover a 3-period window (L+1) at a forecasted 450 units/period (total 1350). Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the massive demand volatility seen in Period 18 (771 units). Lead time is set to 2 to represent the promised lead time while mu_hat accounts for the actual observed 3-period fulfillment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in July: Period 18 demand (771) reached an all-time high. Shipment from Period 12 (522 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Current demand regime (P14-P18) averages ~450 units.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (July 8, 2019), representing the peak of the summer swimwear season. Demand has surged significantly, with Period 18 seeing 771 units and Period 19 seeing 592 units. The 5-period average (P15-P19) is approximately 502 units, reflecting a high-demand regime. However, the system is struggling with inventory availability: on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the shipment from Period 12 (522 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). We have 1603 units in transit (ordered in P18 and P19). Actual lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though 3 periods is the most frequent observed delay. To ensure the OR backend covers demand through the lead time plus review period (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the July surge. I am using recent_N for L (N=5) to account for the actual average lead time, which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current high volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in July: 5-period average (P15-P19) is 502 units. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), with a shipment from Period 12 confirmed lost.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is Period 21 (2019/07/15), the peak of the summer swimwear season. Historical demand for the last five periods (P16-P20: 302, 517, 771, 592, 542) shows an average of 544.8 units, significantly higher than the May/June plateau. Despite the high demand, on-hand inventory is 0 due to shipping delays and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 12 (522 units). The pipeline contains 1603 units (from P18, P19 orders), which is substantial. Lead times for the last four concluded arrivals (excluding the lost P12) were 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods, averaging 2.5 periods. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for recent delivery patterns and protect against stockouts during this high-demand July window. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the current July regime) to capture the 544.8 unit average. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation ~160) observed in July. These parameters aim to ensure the base stock level (covering L+1=4 periods of demand) is high enough to capture the peak season volume while accounting for the unstable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for July peak: 5-period average (P16-P20) is 544.8 units, up from the June average (~400). Lead time remains unstable but modal at 3 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak July demand period for swimwear (Date: 2019/7/22). The demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has averaged 586.4 units, with a notable peak of 771 in Period 18. This indicates a higher demand level than the previous June plateau. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a high pipeline of 2079 units. The order from Period 12 (522 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 10 periods since ordering. The shipment from Period 18 (582 units) is currently overdue based on the typical 3-period lead time. Recent arrivals (P19 order) showed a 2-period lead time, but historical mode is 3. I am setting L to 3 to provide adequate safety stock for the backend calculation given the high volatility and recent stockouts. mu_hat is set using the last 5 periods to capture the current July surge, and sigma_hat is set to the last 5 periods to account for the extreme variability (range 510-771).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for July peak: 5-period average (P17-P21) increased to 586.4 units from the June average (~400). Shipment from Period 18 (582 units) is overdue (3 periods elapsed).

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The product is Women's Swimwear, which is in its peak demand period for the Northern Hemisphere summer. Recent demand data (P18-P22) shows a high-volume regime with a 5-period average of 625 units, significantly higher than the early season averages. Specifically, Period 22 demand reached 710 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 2528 units in-transit. The shipment from Period 12 (522 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 11 periods since it was ordered. The shipment from Period 18 (582 units) is currently at a 4-period lead time, which is slightly overdue compared to the observed 3-period mode but not yet confirmed lost. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.5 periods. To ensure availability during this high-demand peak while the OR backend manages the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 5-period demand average (625 units) and setting L to 3 to account for the frequent delays and provide a safety buffer against the currently overdue Period 18 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late July peak: 5-period average (P18-P22) is 625 units. Shipment from Period 12 is confirmed lost (11 periods elapsed). Period 18 shipment (582 units) is overdue at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal phase (August). Demand remains high and volatile, though it shows signs of a possible cooling compared to the July peak; the 5-period average (P19-P23) is 532.6 units. Lead time is significantly unstable: we have observed arrivals ranging from 1 to 3 periods, while the shipment from P18 (582 units) is currently overdue at 5 periods, and the shipment from P12 is confirmed lost. Because of this instability and the 'In-transit' figure of 2239 units (which includes the overdue P18 and likely lost P12 units), the OR backend might underestimate the need for new orders if it assumes all in-transit units will arrive. To ensure we cover demand during this peak period despite potential shipping delays and losses, I am setting an explicit lead time of 3 periods (the most frequent actual L) and a mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. The sigma_hat is also set to the recent 5-period volatility to manage the high variance observed in July/August.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in August peak season: 5-period average (P19-P23) is 532.6 units. Shipment from Period 18 (582 units) is severely delayed/overdue at L=5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-82.00

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 (mid-August). The 5-period average demand (P20-P24) is 449.4 units, showing a significant decline from the July peak (avg ~625) as the summer swimwear season winds down. Specifically, demand in the last two periods (309, 176) indicates a sharp cooling. The order from Period 18 (582 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is confirmed lost based on the 11-period loss of the P12 order and typical lead times of 1-3 periods. This loss explains why in-transit inventory remains high (1417 units) while on-hand is only 786. Given the seasonality shift, I will use a shorter window (N=5) to capture the cooling demand trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but generally longer actual lead time (avg ~2.5-3 periods) compared to the promised 2. The backend will order to cover the next (L+1) periods, and with a high on-hand balance relative to the new lower demand, the OR engine will likely moderate ordering to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: 5-period average (P20-P24) is 449.4 units, down from July peak of 625 (-28%). Period 18 shipment (582 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed).

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 19), demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has clearly entered a post-peak cooling phase as summer ends. The 5-period average (P21-P25) has dropped to 367.4 units, with the most recent demand (P25) at 132 units. The 3-period average (P23-P25) is even lower at 205.7 units. The current on-hand inventory (654) and in-transit units (1417) are extremely high relative to this cooling demand. The shipment from Period 18 (582 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). To prevent further accumulation of excess inventory and minimize holding costs during this downturn, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the downward trend while maintaining some safety stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility observed during the transition out of the peak season. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (approx 2.5-3 periods), though currently, the system is overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Late August demand (P25: 132 units) is significantly below July peak (average ~600), signaling the end of the primary swimwear season.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly entered a post-peak cooling phase as of late August (Period 27). The demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 154.3 units, compared to the July peak which averaged over 600. Current on-hand inventory is 659 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of current demand. Although 'In-transit' shows 1257 units, historical evidence suggests these are from lost shipments (Period 5: 153 units, Period 12: 522 units, Period 18: 582 units). Even treating the pipeline as zero, the current on-hand inventory is sufficient to meet demand for the next (L+1) periods without new orders. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), the priority is to avoid overstocking during the seasonal decline. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the new lower demand regime and use the default lead time, as the primary goal is to deplete existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak seasonal decline for Swimwear started Period 24. 3-period average (P24-P26) is 154.3 units (-75% from July peak). Shipments from P5, P12, and P18 are confirmed lost.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 2, marking the end of the peak swimwear season. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime, averaging 150.5 units over the last 4 periods (P24-P27), a significant drop from the July peak of ~600. On-hand inventory is 520 units, which covers approximately 3.5 periods of current demand. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, current stock is sufficient. In-transit inventory (1257 units) consists entirely of orders from P5, P12, and P18, which are confirmed lost. The OR engine will subtract this pipeline from the base stock, resulting in a zero order, which is optimal to avoid overstocking as the season ends. Parameters are set to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=4).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal regime confirmed: Demand dropped ~75% from July peak to an average of ~150 units starting Period 24. Shipments from P5, P12, and P18 (total 1257 units) are confirmed lost.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for this swimwear SKU is in a post-peak seasonal decline as of September 9th. The 5-period average (P24-P28) is 136 units, significantly lower than the July peak average of ~625. In Period 28, demand dropped further to 78 units. Although 'In-transit' shows 1257 units, carry-over insights confirm these shipments (from P5, P12, and P18) are lost. Therefore, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. With 442 units on-hand and demand trending below 100 units per period, the current stock covers over 4 periods of demand. To avoid additional holding costs during the off-season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders based on historical peak averages. L is set to calculate (avg ~2.4) to account for the consistent variability observed in arrival times.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Swimwear) is in a clear post-peak seasonal decline as of mid-September. Demand has dropped significantly from the July peak of ~600 units to a much lower regime. The last 5 periods (P25-P29) show demands of 132, 155, 139, 78, and 65. This averages 113.8 units per period, with a clear downward trend towards autumn. Current on-hand inventory is 377 units. Given the declining demand, this inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods. The backend OR logic for base stock is (L+1) * mu. With a lead time of 2 and mu around 100, the base stock would be ~300. Since on-hand (377) exceeds this, and we have 1257 units in-transit (though P5, P12, and P18 are likely lost), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline confirmed: September demand (P28-P29) has dropped below 100 units/period, down from the August average of ~150 units. Total on-hand inventory is currently sufficient for the remainder of the low-demand season.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which has clearly entered its post-peak seasonal decline as of late August (Period 24). Current demand (P28-P30) has plummeted to a range of 30-78 units per period, far below the July peak of ~600. The on-hand inventory is 347 units, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate (approx. 30-50 units/period). Total In-transit units (1257) are composed of orders from P5, P12, and P18 which are confirmed lost per historical carry-over insights. No new orders are needed. The goal is now to bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs while the season ends. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P28-P30) to reflect this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand (P28-P30) has stabilized in a low-demand regime below 80 units/period, following the end of the summer swimwear season.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently at Period 32 (September 30). Demand has entered a clear post-peak seasonal decline as the summer season ends. The last five periods of demand (P27-P31) are [139, 78, 65, 30, 35], showing a consistent downward trend toward a low-demand baseline. The current average demand over these 5 periods is 69.4 units. On-hand inventory is 312 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next few periods (covering roughly 4.5 periods at the current rate). In-transit inventory of 1257 consists of confirmed lost shipments from P5, P12, and P18; because the backend includes 'in-transit' in its pipeline calculation, these ghost units prevent the OR engine from ordering more, which is actually beneficial right now given our overstocked position. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation remains below our current on-hand levels to avoid unnecessary holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. The SKU is a swimwear bottom, which is now in a deep post-peak seasonal decline (Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere). Demand for the last five periods (P28-P32) has been [78, 65, 30, 35, 62], averaging 54 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 250 units, which covers approximately 4.6 periods of the current average demand. Given the seasonal context, demand is expected to remain low or continue to decrease until next year. The current 'In-transit' of 1257 units corresponds to orders from P5, P12, and P18 that were long ago confirmed as lost in previous carry-over insights; they do not represent physical stock expected to arrive. Because on-hand inventory is significantly higher than required for the current (L+1) demand window (3 periods * 54 units = 162 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to the recent 5-period average and sigma_hat to the recent 5-period standard deviation to allow the OR backend to realize that the current stock level is more than sufficient.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) has entered its post-peak low-demand season (Autumn). Demand has significantly dropped from the July peak (avg ~600) to a stabilized low-demand regime. The last 5 periods (P29-P33) show an average demand of 46.0 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 212 units, which, at the current demand rate, is sufficient to cover approximately 4.6 periods of demand. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit) and the clearly declining seasonal trend, no new orders are required. The current in-transit inventory of 1257 units consists of confirmed lost shipments (P5, P12, P18), which the OR backend will correctly discount once the pipeline is compared against a low base stock. We will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand plateau and prevent unnecessary ordering.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has entered its post-peak low-demand regime, typical for the autumn season (October). Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the summer peaks. The most recent 5-period demand average (P30-P34) is 41.6 units. On-hand inventory is currently 169 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next several periods (at least 4 periods worth of stock at current rates). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1257 units represents historical lost shipments from Periods 5, 12, and 18, which the system still tracks but will likely never arrive. Given that on-hand inventory already exceeds the likely calculated base stock for this low-demand phase, the goal is to avoid ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the remaining demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current stable low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed: demand has stabilized at a low level (avg ~42 units/period) following the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is sufficient for the immediate future.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its off-season (late October) with demand for swimwear remaining low and stable. Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 45.6 units. The current on-hand inventory of 119 units provides approximately 2.6 periods of coverage. Although the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1257 units consists of confirmed lost shipments (from Periods 5, 12, and 18), the OR backend will subtract these from the base stock. Given that the target base stock for this low-demand regime will be significantly lower than the perceived pipeline, the system will naturally produce a zero order. This is the optimal outcome to avoid unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit) on a product with a $4.0 profit margin during its lowest demand phase. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to accurately reflect this low-demand state.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is currently in its post-peak/off-season low-demand regime (November). Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging 45.8 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 2 full periods of the current average demand. Although 1257 units are listed as 'In-transit', these represent confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (P5, P12, P18) that never arrived. Because current on-hand inventory is adequate for this low-demand phase and we want to avoid unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) on a product with a relatively low profit margin ($4.0/unit), I am maintaining a conservative stance. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the stability of the current low-demand regime since late September.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is in its post-peak low-demand season (November). Current demand has stabilized at a low level, with the last 5 periods (P33-P37) showing an average of 40.2 units. On-hand inventory is 49 units, which covers approximately one period of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1257 units consists of lost shipments from periods 5, 12, and 18 (153 + 522 + 582 = 1257 units), which will never arrive. Although on-hand inventory is low, the holding cost of $1.00 relative to the $4.00 profit makes overstocking expensive during this low-demand phase. I will set parameters to maintain a slim safety stock for the current low-demand regime, using a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~40 units and volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is currently in its off-peak season (November). Demand has stabilized at a low level, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 41 units. On-hand inventory is currently at 7 units, which is below the expected demand for the upcoming period. Although 'In-transit' shows 1257 units, history confirms that these units (from P5, P12, and P18) are lost shipments and will not arrive. Therefore, a new order is required to cover demand for the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the recent low-demand regime (N=5) for forecasting ensures we don't over-order based on summer peaks. Lead time is set to the promised 2 periods as recent deliveries (before they ceased) fluctuated around 2-3.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime for swimwear is stable at a low level (avg ~41 units/period). All currently listed 'In-transit' units (1257) are confirmed lost shipments from previous peak seasons.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) is in its off-peak winter season. Demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging 35.8 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39). Inventory reached 0 in Period 39 after satisfying 7 units of a 17-unit demand. All 'In-transit' units (1257) are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (Orders P5, P12, and P18). Consequently, pipeline inventory is effectively zero. To minimize holding costs while meeting this low off-season demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current regime (~36 units/period). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect historical performance, though promised is 2. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand, resulting in a small replenishment order appropriate for the current low-demand environment.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's swimwear (bikini bottoms). We are now in Period 41 (Dec 2, 2019), which is the off-season. Demand has been consistently low (averaging ~40 units) from Period 30 through Period 39. However, Period 40 saw a spike to 113 units, likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 1257 units in-transit are from Periods 5, 12, and 18; these are confirmed lost as they are months overdue. Since inventory is 0 and we are approaching the end of the year (where some pre-holiday or vacation demand may occur), we need to resume ordering. I will use the last 11 periods (P30-P40) to capture the low-season mean while including the recent spike. The average demand over P30-P40 is ~46 units. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the historical volatility (averaging ~2.5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 40 (113 units) likely due to late November promotional events (Black Friday), interrupting the stable low-demand off-season regime of ~40 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in its deep off-season (December). Demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging approximately 43 units per period over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), with a brief holiday spike in P40 (113 units) followed by a return toward the baseline in P41 (51 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the 1257 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (Orders from P5, P12, and P18). Consequently, the system believes pipeline inventory is high, which will prevent the OR backend from ordering unless parameters are adjusted. To ensure we fulfill the low but steady off-season demand, I am using an 'explicit' L to reflect the observed average lead time of 3 periods, and 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the current demand regime of ~45 units/period (multiplied by L+1). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock. This configuration will force the OR engine to recognize the need for new stock despite the ghost 'In-transit' units.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 16, 2019), which is the deep off-season for swimwear. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1257 units consists entirely of lost shipments from peak season (Periods 5, 12, and 18), as confirmed in historical carry-over insights. Recent demand has stabilized in a low-demand regime: excluding the Black Friday spike (P40: 113), demand in P41 and P42 was 51 and 57 respectively. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 56.0 units. Given the low-demand off-season, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable state while ignoring the summer peak. The OR engine treats the 1257 units in-transit as real inventory; however, since they are lost, the capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent ordering unless the base_stock exceeds 1257. Since actual demand is ~56, the base_stock will be significantly lower than 1257, meaning no order will be placed. This is acceptable as the game is near its end (Period 43 of 45), and minimizing holding cost on unnecessary winter stock is prioritized.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its off-season (December). Demand has stabilized at a low level, with recent demands for P41-P43 being 51, 57, and 58 units respectively. The spike in P40 (113 units) was a temporary event likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday and has not sustained. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the 1257 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (P5, P12, P18), meaning they will never arrive to satisfy demand. Therefore, the OR backend sees a massive pipeline that doesn't exist. To trigger a new order, I must reconcile the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the current stable off-season demand (~55 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed instability (averaging ~2.5 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the low volatility in this regime. This will ensure the backend targets a base stock sufficient to cover the 2-period lead time plus the current review period without being misled by the ghost 'In-transit' inventory.

Carry-over insight: December off-season demand stabilized: P41-P43 average demand is 55.3 units/period. All 1257 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from P5, P12, and P18.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Swimwear bottom, currently in its deep off-season (late December). Demand has stabilized at a low level, with the last 4 periods (P41-P44) showing a consistent average of 55.75 units per period. The spike in P40 (113 units) was likely a Black Friday anomaly and is not expected to persist. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' figure of 1257 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments from Period 5, Period 12, and Period 18; therefore, pipeline inventory is effectively zero. To restart service for the stable off-season demand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (P41-P44) to cover (L+1) periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historical variability (averaging ~2-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the low volatility of the current regime.
