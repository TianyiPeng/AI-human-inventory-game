Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/25). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the start of the season (late February), demand for swimwear is expected to rise. Historical demand data shows 5 samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], which indicates an upward trend. To ensure we have enough stock for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I will use the mean of the available 5 samples to set the baseline mu_hat. Given the clear growth trend (last period was 213 vs early 61), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current momentum while smoothing out the early period floor. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4 periods) as we have no historical delivery data yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (early March). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Demand history shows [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] followed by the immediate observation in Period 1 of 175. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 138, but the trend is generally upward as we enter spring. On-hand inventory is 0 because the P1 order of 225 units is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. Given the seasonal context of swimwear approaching spring/summer and the recent demand levels (129, 213, 175), I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the higher late-winter/early-spring demand. Lead time (L) is kept at default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest deviation.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. This product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Women's Swimwear), which typically sees a seasonal uptick as spring approaches. Historical demand (5 periods) was [61, 98, 152, 129, 213]. Recent observation in Periods 1 and 2 shows demand around 175 and 173 respectively, confirming a sustained higher plateau compared to early history. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 467 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, so the P1 order (225 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at P6) and P2 order during Period 6. Since we have zero on-hand and high lost sales (sold=0), we must ensure our parameters cover demand for the lead time (4) + current review period (1) = 5 periods. Using N=3 for demand capture (including the last two high-demand periods and the previous high of 213) to set a responsive \u03bc\u0302. \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~175 starting around Period 1 (+75%).

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a Swimwear bottom, and the date is late March, which aligns with the observed ramp-up in demand as we approach the spring/summer season. The demand history [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] and recent sales periods [175, 173, 181] confirm a sustained demand regime shift from ~100 to ~175+ per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (225 units), Period 2 (242 units), and Period 3 (225 units) are all still in-transit and not due to arrive until Period 5 at the earliest (P1 + 4 = P5). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 692 in-transit. Since demand has stabilized at a higher level, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean of ~176.3 and associated volatility, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). L remains at the default (promised) value as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~176 units over the last 3 periods (+76% from early history). Seasonality entry for Swimwear category in March.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is Women's Swimwear, and the date is late March, which correlates with the observed upward trend in demand (last 5 periods: 175, 173, 181, 200, and 213 from pre-history). The current mean demand is 188.4. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 876 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect the first arrival to occur during the resolution of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0) because no orders have arrived yet. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (last 5 samples) to capture the seasonal uptick. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same period to account for recent volatility. I will maintain the promised lead time of 4 until we see the first confirmed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand over the last 5 periods (including pre-history) is 188.4, confirming seasonal growth for Swimwear in March.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/04/01), demand continues to surge as we move deeper into the Swimwear season, hitting 268 units in Period 5. The first order from Period 1 arrived after the promised 4-period lead time, but because demand (268) exceeded the arrival (225), we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The next 4 orders (750 units total) are in-transit. Demand grew from ~60-150 in the off-season to 175-268 recently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~200) plus the current upward trend. For lead time, the first delivery confirmed L=4, so I will maintain the default promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with the high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Average demand since Period 1 is 199.4 (+50% vs historic baseline). Seasonal peak for Swimwear entering April.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently in early April (Period 7), which is the peak demand season for this category. Historical demand analysis shows a significant and accelerating upward trend: [175, 173, 181, 200, 268, 376]. The average demand over the last three periods has jumped to 281.3 units, signaling a transition from the early seasonal build to a peak period. We are currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 for the last two periods) despite arrivals, meaning potential demand is likely even higher than recorded sales. Promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of Period 1 and Period 2 orders exactly at P5 and P6 respectively. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the 80%+ increase in demand observed over the last month. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with the high-growth seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak acceleration confirmed: Average demand increased from ~180 (P1-P3) to 281 (P4-P6), representing a 56% jump in the last 3 periods as April begins.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (April 15). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is in a significant seasonal growth phase as we enter spring/summer. The historical demand shows a clear upward trend: P1-P4 averaged ~182, while P5-P7 averaged ~313. The demand in P6 peaked at 376. In-transit inventory remains high (976 units), but on-hand inventory has been consistently depleted (stocking out for 3 consecutive periods) because local demand spikes are outpacing older order quantities. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). To account for the sharp seasonal acceleration and the recent demand levels (averaging 313 over the last 3 periods) compared to the long-term average (216), I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, N=5 will be used to capture the increased volatility associated with the upward shift while maintaining a slightly larger sample size for stability.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Mean demand shifted from ~182 (P1-P4) to ~313 (P5-P7), a 72% increase, as Swimwear enters its peak season in April.

Daily Reward (R_t): $736.00

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Swimwear SKU in late April, currently in its peak seasonal demand phase. Historically, demand has increased significantly: the average demand over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 326.5, compared to 182.25 in the first 4 periods. The latest demand (Period 8) was 367. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last four periods) because demand is outpacing the orders placed when the regime was lower. Although in-transit inventory is high (1234 units), we need to ensure mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime to maintain an adequate base stock level. I am using recent_N=4 to capture the current seasonal peak (mean ~326.5) while ensuring the OR engine accounts for the (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility during this period.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~182 (P1-P4) to ~327 (P5-P8) as of late April (+80%).

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently at Period 10 (late April). Demand has shown a strong seasonal upward trend as we enter the peak summer season. The average demand over the last 5 periods [P5-P9] is 356.6, compared to the initial periods. However, the system is consistently stocking out (on-hand is 0) because current 'in-transit' logic and standard averages are not reactive enough to this rapid seasonal surge (last period demand was 477). The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrivals in P5-P9. To prevent further stockouts during this peak, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current 350+ demand level, and I am choosing 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this growth phase. This will lift the base stock to cover expected arrivals and current demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge confirmed: Mean demand grew from ~176 (P1-P4) to ~357 (P5-P9) as the Swimwear category enters peak season (late April). Demand volatility has also increased significantly.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Swimwear bottom, currently in its peak seasonal window (May). Demand has seen a sustained and significant increase since Period 5, coinciding with spring and the approach of summer. Over the last three periods (P8-P10), demand has averaged 437.3 units, compared to the P5-P7 average of 313 units, indicating a continuing upward trend as we enter May. Inventory levels have been consistently depleted (ending inventory 0 for 10 straight periods) because the OR backend's default parameters did not account for this seasonal surge. At P11, we have 0 on-hand and 1,672 in-transit. The arrivals from P7 (428 units), P8 (442 units), P9 (415 units), and P10 (387 units) are expected in P11, P12, P13, and P14 respectively, assuming the stable 4-period lead time. To address the stockouts and the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (P6-P10) where demand accelerated most sharply (mean ~397). This will raise the base stock target to better cover the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak season surge.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand acceleration: Mean demand increased from ~313 (P5-P7) to ~437 (P8-P10) as Swimwear enters peak May season (+40% increase in 3 weeks).

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Swimwear bottom, currently entering mid-May, which is the peak seasonal period. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: Period 1-4 averaged ~182, Period 5-8 averaged ~327, and Period 9-11 averaged ~426. The most recent demand (P11) was 332, following two peaks near 470, suggesting some volatility but a sustained high mean as we approach summer. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this peak-season demand level (avg ~411) for mu_hat. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this high-demand regime. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11. Pipeline inventory (1699) is high relative to current on-hand (96), but given the 4-period lead time and demand levels >400, a base stock targeting (L+1) or 5 periods of demand (~2055 units) is appropriate to avoid stockouts during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Mean demand since Period 8 (May onset) has stabilized at ~426 units, a 30% increase over the April average (~327).

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal window (mid-May). Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 8 (May onset), with demand averaging 405.7 units over the last three periods (P10: 468, P11: 332, P12: 417). The Carry-over insight from Period 12 confirms this stabilized high-demand regime. For Period 13, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific 'peak May' behavior, which is about 30% higher than the April average (~327). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the game history. The parameters are set to ensure sufficient base stock (targeting 5 periods of demand: L+1) to minimize stockouts during this high-profit seasonal peak while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal demand for Swimwear confirmed: Mean demand since Period 10 (May) has stabilized at ~406 units, approximately 24% higher than the April average (~327).

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak season (late May). Analysis of demand from Period 10 to 13 shows a stable high regime with an average demand of approximately 396 units (468, 332, 417, 370). Although May is the peak for swimwear, we are approaching the end of the month, and demand remains robust but has leveled off compared to the rapid acceleration seen in April. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (P1-P9 orders all arrived exactly at P+4). My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat based on the stable May performance ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock relative to the current ~400 unit per period demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility of this peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2072.00

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak summer season (early June). Lead times have been consistently 4 periods based on history (P10 order arrived in P14). Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has stabilized at 422.4 units, with the most recent period reaching 525, indicating potential volatility as we reach the height of June. I will use a recent demand window of N=5 to capture this high-season baseline (422.4 units per period). With a lead time of 4 periods and the current period (L+1=5), the mu_hat parameter should target approximately 2112 units (5 * 422.4) to maintain service levels during this peak. The current inventory position is 28 (on-hand) + 1542 (in-transit) = 1570, which is below the target. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock and replenish accordingly to meet the sustained high demand.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal demand sustained into June: Mean demand over P10-P14 is 422.4 units, maintaining the ~420 baseline established in May.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently in peak season (June 10th). Historically, demand for this category surges in April and May, stabilizing at a high level. Since Period 10 (May start), the average demand has been approximately 402 units (P10: 468, P11: 332, P12: 417, P13: 370, P14: 525, P15: 330). Although P15 saw a dip to 330, the volatility is high, and June usually maintains peak swimwear demand. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals from orders placed in P1 to P11). Currently, on-hand is 153 and in-transit is 1636. Orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15 are expected in P16, P17, P18, and P19 respectively. I will use a recent_N (N=6) to capture the high-demand regime since May, ensuring the base stock level (mu_hat) covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon necessary to maintain service levels during this peak period.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is the peak season for the 'Swimwear' category. Analysis of recent demand shows a potential cooling off or stabilization compared to the late May peak: demand in the last two periods (P15: 330, P16: 302) is lower than the May average (P11-P14 avg: 411). However, historical data for this product code shows significant volatility. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Since the profit is $4 and the holding cost is $1, the target service level (q = 4/(4+1)) is 0.80. Given that we are in the middle of summer, demand is expected to remain robust but perhaps not grow further. I will use a recent window of N=7 (covering both the May peak and early June cooling) to calculate the demand mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand while avoiding over-ordering as we move toward late June.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand stabilization: Mean demand in early June (P15-P16) has decreased to ~316 units from the May average of ~411 units, suggesting the initial seasonal surge has plateaued or is entering a slightly lower mid-summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1954.00

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU corresponds to Women's Swimwear in late June (2019/06/24). Historically, demand for this category peaked in May and early June (averaging ~420 units per period) and has shown high volatility recently with a demand of 517 in Period 17, following two lower periods (~316 avg). The carry-over insight from P17 suggested a potential plateau, but the most recent pulse (P17 demand: 517) indicates that high seasonal demand persists as we move into the peak summer period (late June/July). Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of P17, with the P13 order arriving exactly on time). Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches history perfectly. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture only the sustained 'high season' regime (May/June) which averages ~400 units per period, while calculating for the (L+1)=5 period window. This ensures enough base stock to cover demand across the replenishment cycle. Sigma_hat is updated using the same recent window to reflect the increased volatility observed in late May and June.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge in P17 (517 units) refutes the previous plateau hypothesis, confirming sustained high-season demand for Swimwear into late June and moving into July.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1684.00

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is experiencing a massive demand surge as it enters July (Period 19), with demand jumping from ~517 in Period 17 to a peak of 771 in Period 18. This correlates with peak summer seasonality. The last 18 periods show a promised lead time of 4 which has remained perfectly consistent (Actual L = 4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 18 demand (771) completely depleted the available stock (421). Demand is clearly in a new high-volatility regime. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the extreme growth from June into July (averaging P15-P18 demand: 330, 302, 517, 771 = 480 average). Setting mu_hat to reflect this current pace (1+L)*480 will help the OR backend catch up. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=4 to account for the significantly increased variance seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand explosion in late June/early July: Demand peaked at 771 units in Period 18, a ~50% increase over the May/June baseline of ~420. Demand volatility has significantly expanded.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal window (early July). Demand has exploded over the last 3 periods, averaging ~626 units (compared to the May average of ~411 units), with extreme volatility (peak demand of 771 units). The observed lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is zero, and we are currently relying on incoming shipments to meet demand. To avoid stockouts during this high-stakes July peak, I am adjusting mu_hat to capture the most recent 5-period surge (averaging ~518 units/period, or 2590 units over L+1) and increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in late June/early July. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat ensures the backend reflects the shift from ~400 units to >500 units mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand explosion in July: Mean demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) has risen to 626 units, a ~50% increase over the May/June baseline (~420). Demand volatility has increased significantly since P18.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 21), which is the peak season for Women's Swimwear. Demand has exploded recently, moving from a May/June average of ~420 to a significantly higher July baseline. The last three periods (P18-P20) saw demands of 771, 592, and 542 (average 635), compared to previous months. This confirms a clear seasonal surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 2443 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero stock, we must use recent demand statistics (last 3-4 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current peak-summer sales volume and the increased volatility observed in the July spike. We use N=4 to capture the shift that began in Period 18 while keeping enough sensitivity to react to the high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak established: Mean demand for P18-P20 is ~635 units, a 50% increase over the May/June baseline (~420). Volatility has increased significantly during this peak summer period.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its peak seasonal period (late July). Over the last 4 periods (P18-P21), demand has averaged 603.75 units, significantly higher than the May/June baseline of ~420. The current date is July 22nd, which typically represents the height of summer demand for swimwear. Although demand was slightly lower in P20 (542) and P21 (510) compared to the P18 spike (771), it remains critically high and volatile. Stockouts have occurred in the last 4 periods (Ending inventory = 0), indicating that the system is currently under-supplied relative to the peak demand. To recover from these stockouts and protect against the continued high-season demand, I am using a recent window (N=4) to capture this 'July peak' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects current peak demand and the increased volatility observed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July demand peak: Mean demand for P18-P21 is ~604 units (+44% vs May/June baseline). Consistent stockouts in P18-P21 indicate current supply is insufficient for summer peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late July (P23, 2019/7/29), nearing the end of peak swimwear season. Historically, demand has been extremely high and volatile throughout July (P18-P22 avg: ~625). Current on-hand inventory is 0 despite an arrival of 552 units in P22, which was immediately sold out. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With demand peaking at ~771 and recently hitting 710, the pipeline needs to be managed to capture these high numbers before the typical end-of-summer taper. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P18-P22) to capture the current high-demand regime (~625 per period). This N=5 captures the summer peak accurately. Setting L=4 (promised/actual) reflects the observed stability in delivery timing. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak sustained into late July/early August: Mean demand for P18-P22 stabilized at ~625 units with significant volatility (high of 771, low of 510).

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (Aug 5), demand dropped significantly to 309 units from the July average of ~625. This indicates a potential seasonal pivot as peak summer concludes for the Swimwear category. However, one data point is not enough to confirm a full regime shift. The inventory position is currently high with 527 units on-hand and 2499 in-transit, largely due to large orders placed during the July peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and potential end-of-season tapering, I will use a shorter demand window (recent_N=5) to capture the possible downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for remaining summer demand. I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the recent volatility and the sharp drop in Period 23.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-469.00

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-August (2019/08/12). The demand history shows a clear decline from the July peak (approx. 600-700 units) to much lower levels in the last two periods: Period 23 (309) and Period 24 (176). This align with the end-of-season behavior for Women's Swimwear as summer concludes. Total inventory (on-hand 1173 + in-transit 1677) is currently very high relative to these recent demand levels. Specifically, the pipeline contains orders from P21 (795), P22 (233), and P23 (649). Arrival of these units will significantly increase holding costs if demand continues to taper. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this sharp downward trend (avg ~398, resulting in a base stock of ~1990). Given current inventory + pipeline (1173 + 1677 = 2850), the system should naturally stop ordering to allow stock to deplete. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a July average of ~635 to ~242 over the last two periods (P23-P24), a decrease of over 60%.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has entered a sharp post-seasonal decline as of mid-August. Historical demand peaked in July (averaging ~635) but has plummeted over the last three periods (P23: 309, P24: 176, P25: 132). This confirms the end-of-summer regime shift observed in the carry-over insights. We currently have 1,836 units on-hand and 882 in-transit, totaling 2,718 units. Given the recent average demand of ~154 units (P24-P25) or even the P23-P25 average of ~205 units, the current total inventory covers over 13-17 periods of demand. To prevent excessive holding costs and potential obsolescence as the season ends, I am setting parameters to cease further ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the rapid decline, and since the 'cap' mechanism will prevent orders due to high inventory relative to the new demand mean, this will stabilize the position without incurring further costs.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~625 (July peak) to ~205 (P23-P25), a 67% reduction. Inventory levels are now excessive for the remaining off-season demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has entered a clear end-of-season collapse as of late August. After peaking in July at ~625 units, demand over the last four periods (P23-P26) has plummeted to 309, 176, 132, and 155 respectively. The mean demand for the most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) is approximately 154 units, representing a massive drop from the peak. Current on-hand inventory is very high (1,914 units) with an additional 649 units due to arrive (ordered P23). Given the current holding cost of $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit margin, having nearly 2,000 units on hand for a demand profile of ~150 units per period (over 12 weeks of coverage) creates a significant risk of excessive holding costs. For Period 27, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this post-peak regime and prevent further ordering. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed: Mean demand for P24-P26 is ~154 units, a decrease of 75% from the July peak of ~625 units.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has entered a post-peak seasonal decline as the calendar moves into September (Period 28, 2019/9/2). Current on-hand inventory is 2,424 units, which is extremely high relative to the recent demand regime (average of ~150 units over P24-P27). No further orders are in transit. The primary focus now is to minimize holding costs by preventing any new orders. The backend's base-stock calculation must be set to a value significantly lower than the current on-hand inventory to ensure 'final order = 0'. I will use the recent_N method (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment (~150 units/period) while acknowledging the high inventory already covers more than 16 periods of future demand at these levels.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly exited its peak summer season. Demand has collapsed from a July peak of ~625 units to a late August/early September average of ~116 units (P26-P28). The current date is September 9th, and demand for swimwear typically bottoms out as autumn begins. We currently have 2,346 units on-hand with zero in-transit shipments, which is approximately 20 periods of cover at current demand levels. This significant overstock warrants a complete halt in ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to reflect the post-peak demand crash and 'default' for other parameters. The backend will naturally order 0 units because the current inventory (2,346) far exceeds the base stock level calculated from the lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Mean demand has stabilized at ~124 units (P25-P28) as of early September, following a 75%+ decline from July peaks. Inventory is currently in an overstock position.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Swimwear bottoms) has entered its post-summer off-season as of September. Demand has plummeted from a peak of ~600+ units in July to a current 4-period average (P26-P29) of approximately 109 units. Demand in the most recent two periods (P28-P29) has dropped even further to 78 and 65 units respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 2,281 units with zero in-transit. Given the current demand levels, this inventory represents over 20 weeks of supply. Therefore, no additional orders are necessary. I will set the mu_hat to reflect the recent demand decline using a short lookback window (recent_N=5) to ensure the OR backend's target base stock stays well below our current massive on-hand position, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed while holding costs are being incurred.

Carry-over insight: September demand stabilization: Mean demand for P26-P29 is ~110 units, confirming the end of the swimwear season and a shift to a low-volume baseline. Current on-hand inventory is excessive (20+ weeks of supply) for the detected demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (late September). The demand for Women's Swimwear has collapsed following the summer peak, consistent with seasonal expectations. Most recent demands are [176, 132, 155, 139, 78, 65, 30], showing a clear downward trend towards a low off-season baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 2,251 units, which at the current demand rate of approximately 30-65 units per period, represents over 35 weeks of stock. Since the target stock level (base stock) based on the current regime would be significantly lower than 2,251, the capped order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in zero orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this most recent low-demand baseline (mean ~68), ensuring the OR backend acknowledges the regime shift and avoids any unnecessary ordering while we burn through existing excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor established: Mean demand for P28-P30 has dropped to ~58 units, reflecting the final exit from the summer season for Swimwear.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has entered its off-season phase as of late September. Current demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, with an average of approximately 52 units over the last four periods (P28-P31: 78, 65, 30, 35). Current on-hand inventory is 2216 units, which is extremely high (approximately 40+ weeks of supply) relative to the current demand regime. No further orders are needed for the foreseeable future, as the goal is to minimize holding costs while the existing inventory gradually depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect this low-demand state, which will result in a base stock level significantly below current on-hand inventory, effectively stopping all new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-season floor established in late September: Mean demand for P28-P31 has dropped to ~52 units as Swimwear demand reaches its annual minimum.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly entered its post-season floor as of October. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) being approximately 48 units. Current on-hand inventory is 2,154 units, which, at the current demand rate, represents over 40 periods of supply\u2014well beyond the remaining 13 periods of the game. Given this extreme overstock position and the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) relative to profit ($4.00/unit), the priority is to avoid any further orders while the backend depletes the existing inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this low-demand regime, which will ensure the base_stock calculation remains far below the current inventory + pipeline level, resulting in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-season floor for Swimwear baseline established: Mean demand for P29-P32 is ~48 units, a -92% decline from July peak. Inventory levels are extremely high relative to current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1964.00

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear), and we are now in mid-October (Period 34). Demand has reached its seasonal trough, with the last 5 periods (P29-P33) averaging ~46 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 2116 units, which at the current demand rate represents over 45 weeks of supply, far exceeding the remaining periods in the simulation (45 total). Consequently, no new orders are required. To prevent any automated ordering via the OR backend, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 5-period window to reflect the current low-demand regime, which combined with the high on-hand stock and zero in-transit inventory, will keep the order quantity at zero. The lead time L is maintained at the default promised value of 4 periods, as it is consistent with historical performance and not a factor given the overstock.

Carry-over insight: Post-season floor for Swimwear baseline confirmed: Mean demand for P29-P33 is ~46 units, reflecting absolute seasonal minimum. Significant overstock exists for the remainder of the year.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in late October (Period 35). Demand has hit an absolute seasonal floor, following a massive collapse from the July peak of ~635 units to a current 5-period average (P30-P34) of roughly 41.6 units. The ending on-hand inventory is 2,073 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current demand regime (~42 units/period), the on-hand stock covers nearly 50 periods, which far exceeds the remaining 10 periods of the game. The priority is to avoid any further orders and minimize holding costs, although the inventory level is already fixed and excessive. I will set the demand parameters to reflect this current low-volume floor to ensure the OR backend (base-stock policy) does not trigger any new orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has entered its post-season floor. Current demand is stabilized at a very low level, with the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) being 45.6 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 2,023 units, which provides over 40 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Since the remaining game length is 9 periods (45 total periods - 36 current), no further orders are required to meet demand for the rest of the year. The primary objective is to minimize holding costs by preventing any further replenishment. Parameters are set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level remains far below the existing on-hand inventory to yield a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Post-season floor fully stabilized: Mean demand for P31-P35 is 45.6 units, confirming the final low-volume baseline for the remainder of the year.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has firmly entered its post-season floor in November. Recent demand (P31-P36) reflects a stable, low-volume baseline with a mean of approximately 44 units. Current on-hand inventory is 1,987 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 40 periods of supply\u2014effectively the remainder of the game. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), and the extreme overstock position, I will continue to place zero orders. Parameters for the OR backend are set to reflect this stable low-demand regime using a recent window (N=5) to ensuremu_hat and sigma_hat calculations are not skewed by the summer peak demand history.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Swimwear bottoms) is in its annual seasonal minimum. Demand has stabilized at a very low baseline (mean of ~40 units over the last 7 periods). On-hand inventory is currently 1,953 units, which provides approximately 48 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Given that there are only 8 periods remaining in the game (P38 to P45) and the cost of holding inventory ($1.00) is significant relative to the unit profit ($4.00), no further orders should be placed. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not place additional orders while we bleed off the massive overstock.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Swimwear bottom, which has exited its peak summer season (July demand mean ~635) and is now in a pre-winter off-season floor. Current demand (Period 38: 42 units) is consistent with the established baseline for September-November (averaging ~45 units). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,911 units, representing over 40 weeks of supply at current demand rates. No orders are in transit, and none are necessary. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive overstock, the objective is to prevent any further ordering by setting parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime and high inventory position. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=8 to capture the stable post-season demand (P31-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its absolute off-season floor (late November). Demand has been consistently low since mid-September, with the most recent four-period average (P36-P39) at approximately 32 units. Current on-hand inventory is 1,894 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 50 periods\u2014far exceeding the remaining 6 periods of the game. The priority remains minimizing holding costs by placing zero orders. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the most recent 5-period window (P35-P39) to accurately reflect this low-volume regime and prevent the OR engine from triggering any 'safety' orders. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4, as actual lead times have been consistent.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its deep off-season (December). Current on-hand inventory is 1,781 units, while recent demand has stabilized at a low floor: the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is approximately 45 units per period. Period 40 showed a spike to 113 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions, but this is an outlier compared to the broader seasonal trend. With over 35 weeks of supply based on the current mean, and only 5 periods remaining in the simulation, no further orders are required. The objective is to minimize holding costs while the existing stock covers all remaining demand. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and lead time remains at the default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected in Period 40 (113 units) during late November, likely linked to promotional events, but does not represent a sustained shift in the off-season baseline.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, and we are in Period 42 out of 45. The product is Women's Swimwear, which is currently in its off-season low-demand period. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,730 units, while the recent demand (P41) was 51 units. Even with the slight holiday spike observed in P40 (113 units), the mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 51.4 units. Given there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P42, P43, P44, P45), the existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. No further orders are needed. I am using recent_N (N=11, covering since early October) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable, low-volume off-season regime and avoid over-weighting the P40 outlier.

The focus remains on minimizing order placement to avoid increasing holding costs for inventory that will not be sold within the game's timeframe. I will maintain the L at default (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=7) to reflect the low-volume post-season baseline characterized by demand levels between 17 and 57 units (excluding the P40 outlier).

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019 (Period 44). The product is a Swimwear bottom, which is currently in its absolute seasonal low following the summer peak (July) and a minor holiday spike in late November. Demand over the last three periods (P41-P43) has averaged 55.3 units, signaling a stable off-season baseline. On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1615 units, sufficient to cover approximately 29 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that the game ends in Period 45, it is impossible to sell through the remaining stock, and any further ordering would only increase holding costs without increasing revenue. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime using a recent window (N=10) to capture the post-holiday stabilization, though the OR backend will correctly place no orders due to the massive inventory surplus.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear category), which is in its absolute seasonal low period following a major July peak and a September collapse. Current demand has stabilized at a low baseline; the mean demand for the last 4 periods (P41-P44) is 55.75 units. Despite a one-off holiday spike in P40 (113 units), the surrounding demand confirms a post-season floor. The on-hand inventory is 1,558 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~56 units/period, represents approximately 27-28 weeks of supply. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and the pipeline is empty, the inventory position is extremely overstocked. No new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 14 periods (back to P31) to capture the stable post-season variance and mean while ignoring the late November flyer, ensuring the backend does not trigger an order due to inflated volatility or mean estimates.
