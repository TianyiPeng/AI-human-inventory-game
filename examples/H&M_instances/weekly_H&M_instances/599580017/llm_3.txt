  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I have no historical performance data for this SKU in the current environment but I have the seed samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], which average approximately 131 units. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Women's Swimwear). The current date is February 25th, which is the start of the pre-spring/vacation season for swimwear in many regions, typically leading into a peak in late spring/summer. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand resolution happens after the order arrives (for L=0), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand. Given the seed data shows an upward trend (61 to 213) and the seasonal timing, I will target the higher end of the samples plus a small buffer to avoid stockouts on the first day. I will order 220 units to cover the expected demand for Period 1.",

Given that actual lead time is consistently 0, the order placed now arrives in the same period to meet demand. With on-hand inventory at 35 units and demand trending downwards (65 in the last period), it is prudent to order enough to meet an expected demand of approximately 60-70 units while keeping ending inventory low to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit) during the off-season.
