In the retail calendar, late February marks the beginning of the 'Spring/Summer' transition. Customers start purchasing swimwear for spring break trips and upcoming summer holidays. b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples are [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], showing a clear upward trend (average ~130, but recent samples are much higher). Given the product type and the date, I expect demand to be in the higher range (150-220+) as the season ramps up. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P3. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. This is the start of the simulation. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using a conservative average of 150-180 per period based on the uptrend, I need roughly 450-540 units to ensure service level and account for the initial zero stock. I will order 500 units to establish a baseline inventory and meet immediate seasonal demand.",

Period 1 actual demand was 175, which aligns with the higher end of the historical distribution and supports a seasonal ramp-up. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 500 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at Period 4 start). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 0. Demand of 175 in Period 1 was lost (sold=0) because we started with 0 inventory. We have 500 units in-transit. e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) before the next possible order can arrive. Assuming demand averages ~180-200 due to seasonality, total required for 3 periods is ~540-600 units. We have 500 in transit.

Current reliable pipeline (In-transit - Lost P5 order) is 2050 - 250 = 1800 units. Although 1800 > 1350, I must account for the fact that P13 ended at 0 stock and P14 arrivals are not yet visible.

(b) Demand Regime Analysis: Demand remains high but volatile (P22: 710, P23: 309). The P23 drop may be noise or the first sign of seasonal cooling, but historical peak regime has averaged 550-600 units. (c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Supplier reliability is extremely poor. Confirmed lost orders (lead time > 3): P5 (250), P10 (300), P12 (550), P16 (400), P17 (500), P18 (500). Total lost = 2,500 units. Additionally, the order from P21 (700) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived; while still within the 'successful' window, its absence is concerning.

Demand analysis shows a significant and sustained seasonal decline as summer ends: Period 24 demand was 176 and Period 25 was 132, compared to the July peak of 500-700+. We are currently in a late-summer/pre-autumn regime where demand is expected to stabilize at lower levels (likely 100-130 units/period). On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1,463 units. Even if we exclude the 2,500 units definitively classified as lost (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18), the remaining pipeline contains a P23 order of 1,000 units which may still arrive. With 1,463 units on hand and demand falling toward ~130, we have over 10 periods of supply. Ordering now would only increase holding costs during a low-demand season.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms), which is currently in its off-season (December). Historical demand from September through early December has consistently remained low, typically between 30 and 60 units per period, with a minor outlier in Period 40 (likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotion). The current on-hand inventory is 1,418 units. Given that there are only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (Periods 43, 44, and 45) and the expected demand per period is approximately 50 units, the total remaining demand is estimated to be around 150 units. The current on-hand inventory is already far in excess of this requirement. No further orders are needed, and the priority is to minimize additional holding costs while satisfying the remaining demand.",

Period 44 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). We are currently in Period 44 (December 23, 2019), which is the off-season for swimwear in most regions. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 50 units per period over the last 10 periods, with a brief spike in P40 likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. Current on-hand inventory is 1,360 units. With only 1 period remaining in the simulation (Period 45) and an on-hand balance that covers more than 25 periods of current demand, there is an massive surplus. The holding cost is $1.0 per unit, while the profit is $4.0 per unit. Since we have enough stock to satisfy all possible demand for the final period without any risk of stockout, no further orders are required. Adding more inventory would only increase holding costs and reduce the total reward.",

{
  "rationale": "The current period is 45, which is the final period of the game (Date: 2019/12/30). According to the game timeline, orders placed in Period 45 arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 45 (if lead time is 0) or later. However, demand resolution for the final period occurs immediately after the decision phase, and the game concludes. With an on-hand inventory of 1,303 units and current demand for swimwear at an off-season low (averaging ~50 units), there is an massive surplus of stock. Any additional order would only increase holding costs without any opportunity for additional sales, as this is the terminal period. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units to maximize the final reward by avoiding unnecessary holding costs and capital expenditure.",
