Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/25). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear), which is highly seasonal. As we move from February into March and Spring, demand for swimwear is expected to rise. Historical demands are [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], showing a clear upward trend (regime shift/growth). The promised lead time is 4. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the accelerating demand (mean of 152, 129, 213 is ~165) rather than the long-term average, as the growth is likely sustained heading into the season. Since on-hand and in-transit are zero, the base stock calculation needs to account for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods). I choose recent_N = 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current momentum while remaining responsive.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory and observed a demand of 175 units (all lost sales). This demand is higher than the historical pre-game average (mean of [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] is ~130.6). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and the date is early March (2019/3/4), which suggests the beginning of the spring/summer peak season in some markets. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (237 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (1 + 4). To handle the current demand spike (175 units) which is 34% higher than the historical average, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand volatility and volume. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4), as we have no evidence yet to suggest deviation from the promised timing.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (March 11, 2019). The product is a Timeless Midrise Brief (bikini bottoms), which is seasonal. Current demand for the first two periods has been consistent (175, 173), suggesting a stable early-season baseline. However, we have severe stockouts (On-hand: 0) because the promised lead time is 4 periods, and orders from Period 1 (placed Feb 25) are not expected until Period 5. Total in-transit is 479 (237 from P1 + 242 from P2). I will use the current mean demand of ~174 across the (L+1) horizon. With L=4, (L+1)=5 periods. mu_hat = 174 * 5 = 870. Given the consistent demand, I will use a conservative sigma_hat. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to focus on the current demand level observed so far.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is Women's Swimwear, which typically sees increasing demand as spring progresses toward summer. Historical demand (pre-game: 61, 98, 152, 129, 213; in-game: 175, 173, 181) shows a clear upward trend compared to the earlier historical data, though it has stabilized around 176 units/period over the last 3 periods. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (237 units), Period 2 (242 units), and Period 3 (177 units) are all still in-transit. The first order (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales. To calculate parameters: 1) L is set to default (4). 2) mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current stabilized demand level (~176/period) rather than the lower preseason values. 3) sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current variability.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's swimwear bottom (SKU 599580017). Current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand data shows a steady increase: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] followed by recent game history demands of [175, 173, 181, 200]. This represents a significant upward trend as we enter the spring/summer season for swimwear. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the game started at Period 1, the first order (placed in P1) is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 840 units in transit (sum of orders from P1-P4). Given the seasonal nature and clear upward trend, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher late-spring demand levels. Mean of the last 5 demand points is (213+175+173+181+200)/5 = 188.4. L is set to default (4). mu_hat for L+1 (5 periods) will be based on this recent average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from a 5-period historical average of 130 to a recent 4-period game average of 182 (+40%) consistent with swimwear seasonality approaching Q2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $948.00

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 corresponds to April 1st. As the item is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear), demand is entering its seasonal peak in Q2. Historical demand has trended upward significantly: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173, 181, 200, 268]. The most recent 5 periods (P1-P5) average 199.4 units, with P5 peaking at 268. The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in P5. The pipeline (In-transit: 738) includes orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). To capture the seasonal acceleration and high demand volatility, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to project a demand level of roughly 200/period. For sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N of 5 to account for the increased variance during this growth phase. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift confirmed as seasonal growth: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) reached 199.4 (+53% over pre-P1 average); peak demand of 268 in P5 suggests continued Q2 acceleration for swimwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $968.00

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (Timeless Midrise Brief) entering April, which represents the start of peak Q2 seasonality. Demand has shown a significant and consistent acceleration: P5 demand was 268 and P6 demand spiked to 376. The average demand of the last two periods is 322, which is significantly higher than the 5-period average of 199 cited in previous insights. Because demand is currently stock-out limited (we only sold what arrived), the true latent demand is likely even higher than the 376 recorded. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 761 in-transit. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). To capture the rapid seasonal climb, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect an expected weekly demand of 400 units over the (L+1=5) period horizon, totaling 2000 units. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high volatility during this growth phase. L is kept at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Q2 Seasonal acceleration confirmed; demand increased from ~200 to 376+ in P6. Stock-outs in P5 and P6 indicate latent demand exceeds current arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (April 15), entering the peak Q2 season for swimwear. Demand remains much higher than early periods, with the last three periods averaging 313 units (268, 376, 295), despite stock-outs in every period since arrivals began. Current on-hand is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 1095 units. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). To account for the Q2 seasonal surge and latent demand masked by stock-outs, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, and L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Post-P5 average (313 units) is significantly higher than P1-P4 (~182 units); continuing stock-outs suggest true demand may exceed 300 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $736.00

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (late April), entering the peak season for women's swimwear. Demand has significantly accelerated, with the last four periods showing an average demand of 326.5 units, though we have consistently stocked out, meaning true demand is likely higher. Observed lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with 1,317 units in transit (arrivals expected in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12 from orders placed in P5, P6, P7, and P8). To address the continued stockouts and seasonal peak, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand regime (approx. 326.5 per period), and L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time. This will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the lead time plus the review period (5 periods total demand).

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P5-P8) average is 326.5 units/period, representing a +64% increase over the previous regime (P1-P4: 199.4). Continued stockouts suggest true demand exceeds 350+ units as we enter May.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late April (Date: 2019/4/29), entering the peak Q2 season for swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief). Demand is aggressively accelerating: Period 9 demand reached 477, significantly higher than the 4-period average of 326.5 from P5-P8. The last 5 periods (P5-P9) average is now 356.6, but the visual trend shows 268-376-295-367-477, indicating that 400+ is the new local benchmark. Stock-outs have occurred in every period from P5 to P9 because arrivals (based on orders from P1-P5) are insufficient for this seasonal surge. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). To aggressive address the stock-out and capture the seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat to 2250, which covers 5 periods (L+1) at an expected average of 450 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (sqrt(5) * ~112) to account for high demand volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late April: Period 9 demand (477) is +32% higher than the previous 4-period average (326.5) and is the highest recorded, confirming we are in the peak seasonal ramp-up for swimwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1060.00

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak seasonal ramp-up for Women's Swimwear in early May. Period 10 demand (468) and Period 9 demand (477) show a stabilized high-demand regime, significantly above earlier averages. The last 4 periods (P7-P10) have an average demand of 401.75 units. Despite shipments arriving regularly with a consistent lead time of 4 periods, we are still stocking out (on-hand is 0) because demand consistently exceeds the quantities ordered during the pre-peak phase. To address this, mu_hat must reflect this new seasonal level. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current 400+ units/period demand regime. For L, the historical evidence consistently shows the promised 4-period lead time is being met. sigma_hat will also be based on the recent N=4 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels: P7-P10 average demand is 401.75 units, a 23% increase over the P5-P8 average of 326.5. Consistent lead time of 4 periods confirmed through P10.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/05/13), which is the peak season for women's swimwear (SKU 599580017). Historically, demand significantly increased from early April, peaking around late April/early May (P9-P10 demand > 460). Period 11 demand dropped slightly to 332, potentially due to the end of a specific promotion or early May holiday, but overall volumes remain high relative to the pre-April baseline. Lead time is confirms at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5-P11). The current transition to on-hand inventory (179 units) after a long period of stockouts is a critical turning point. To properly calibrate for the summer peak while acknowledging the slight cooling in P11, I will use a recent demand window. The demand regime from P7 to P11 shows an average of ~388. Based on swimwear seasonality, demand is expected to remain high through June. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P7-P11) to capture this established peak-season level, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: May peak seasonality confirmed: P7-P11 demand average is 389.8 units, maintaining the high-volume regime established in April (+95% over P1-P4 baseline). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (late May), which is peak season for Women's Swimwear. Analysis of periods 9-12 shows a stable but high-volume demand regime averaging 423.5 units per period ([477, 468, 332, 417]). Although Periods 11 and 12 show slightly lower demand compared to the late April spikes, they still reflect a significant structural increase from the early spring baseline. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 12. Currently, there is sufficient on-hand inventory (168) and a large pipeline (1508) to cover the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current peak demand level (avg ~424 per period) and ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock level appropriate for the established seasonal high. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime peak sustained: P9-P12 average demand is 423.5 units, confirming the high-volume state for swimwear as we enter June. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (Late May). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and demand remains consistently high as we approach peak summer months. Period 13 demand was 370, and the average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 412.8 units. The lead time is confirmed as a stable 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). Although on-hand inventory is 213, there is a large pipeline (1626 units) including a significant order of 634 units from Period 10 due this period (P14), followed by smaller orders (207 in P11, 252 in P12). To maintain the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accounting for the high volume expected in June, I will use the recent 5-period demand average (P9-P13) of 412.8.mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*412.8 = 2064.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1778.00

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak seasonal window for swimwear (early June). Period 14 demand (525) represents the highest recorded demand in the series, indicating that demand is accelerating again as we enter the summer travel and beach season. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P11-P14) is 411 units, but the sudden jump to 525 in P14 suggests a new local peak. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods according to the game history (confirmed through the arrival of the P10 order in P14). To capture the current seasonal strength and avoid stockouts during this high-volume period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to weight the recent baseline, while acknowledging that the underlying demand is volatile but in a high-volume regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level capable of supporting ~400+ units per week across the L+1 (5 period) risk window.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Summer peak confirmed; P14 demand (525) is the highest recorded, increasing the 4-period moving average to 411 units (+26% over the P1-P13 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16 (June 10), which is the peak summer season for swimwear. Historical demand analysis shows a high-volume regime since Period 9, with demand frequently exceeding 400 units. The most recent demand (Period 15) was 330 units, while Period 14 was 525 units. The moving average for the last 5 periods is approximately 403 units. Given the seasonality of bikini bottoms in mid-June, demand is expected to remain high and potentially volatile as temperatures rise. On-hand inventory is currently 199 units with 1,677 units in transit. Lead time has been consistently observed at 4 periods without disruption. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand summer regime (P11-P15) while filtering out the lower pre-April baseline. Setting L to 'default' utilizes the confirmed 4-period promised lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-June (Period 17). Historically, demand for swimwear like these midrise bikini bottoms peaks in late May and remains robust through June and July. Period 14 saw a peak of 525, but the last two periods (P15, P16) showed a slight cooling (330, 302). However, as we approach the core summer vacation season, we must maintain a base stock that accounts for potential demand spikes. The moving average of the last 6 periods is approximately 380 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) captures the high-volume summer regime while acknowledging the recent slight dip. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on recent volatility to prevent stock-outs during possible late June surges.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P11-P16) maintains an average of 379.3 units, confirming sustained high-volume swimwear season; weekly demand has fluctuated between ~300 and ~525 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its peak June summer demand phase. Period 17 witnessed high demand (517 units), which is the second highest recorded after Pearl 14 (525 units). Looking at the recent 4-period window (P14-P17), the average demand is 418.5 units. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the Period 17 arrival (ordered P13, arrived P17). Since we are currently in the high-volume summer season (June/July), I will use the recent 4-period average to capture the high consumption rates while providing enough buffer for continued volatility between ~300 to ~525 units. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 ensures the base stock reflects current peak levels and high variance observed in June.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak sustained: P14-P17 average demand is 418.5 units, with specific high peaks (>500) occurring in late June (P17). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19 (2019/7/1), entering the heart of the summer peak for swimwear. Period 18 saw the highest demand recorded yet (771 units), significantly exceeding previous peaks (~525) and leading to a stock-out (ending on-hand: 0). This confirms a massive seasonal spike associated with early July. The current 4-period demand average (P15-P18) is 480 units, and the 8-period average (P11-P18) is 433.25 units. Given the jump to 771, recent_N with N=4 is appropriate to capture this latest surge while balancing with the surrounding high-demand weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With a Profit of $4 and Holding Cost of $1, the backend's critical ratio is 0.8, which targets a high service level. My parameters will provide the OR engine with the necessary mean and volatility estimates to cover the L+1 period pipeline, ensuring enough stock is ordered to mitigate future stock-outs during this high-volume July period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer peak confirmed: Period 18 demand surged to 771 units, a 47% increase over the previous record (525), marking the strongest seasonal peak for swimwear to date.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-July peak for swimwear (Period 20, July 8th). Last period (P19) demand was 592, following a record high of 771 in P18. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) is 502.4 units, which is a significant increase from the previous May-June regime. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P15 order arrived at P19). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 1,928 units in-transit (ordered in P16-P19). To ensure we capture the remaining July/August peak, I am setting L to 4 using 'calculate' and mu_hat to a recent 5-period average (P15-P19) to reflect the current high-demand regime of approximately 500 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set to a 5-period window to capture the increased volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime peak confirmed: P15-P19 average demand reached 502.4 units, a 20%+ increase over the June average, driven by extreme peaks in P18 (771) and P19 (592).

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the July peak for swimwear (midrise brief). Recent demand (Period 18: 771, Period 19: 592, Period 20: 542) shows significantly higher volume and volatility compared to previous months. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods is 549 units, but this includes the exceptional 771 spike. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while recognizing the stockouts in Periods 18-20, which suggest latent demand may still be higher than sales. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game history, so I am sticking with the default promised lead time. Sigma_hat will be based on the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility seen during the summer surge.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed: 3-period average (P18-P20) is 635 units, with frequent stockouts indicating latent demand is potentially higher than recorded arrivals/sales. Lead time remain stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak July swimwear season (Date: 2019/7/22). History shows a massive demand surge starting in mid-June, with demand consistently exceeding 500 units and peaking at 771 (P18). The last 4 periods (P18-P21) have an average demand of 603.75 units, but stockouts in every one of those periods indicate that actual demand is likely higher than recorded sales. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out despite high in-transit volumes, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period window to capture this high-peak regime. I will use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current high volatility. Current in-transit is 2815, which is roughly 4.6 periods of peak demand, implying the OR backend will calculate we are near our target inventory, but the parameters must remain high to ensure orders continue as we sustain this peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak sustained: P18-P21 average demand is 603.75 units, an 18% increase over the previous regime (P15-P19). Frequent stockouts confirm that latent demand likely exceeds 650 units during this seasonal peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) remains in a high-volume mid-summer peak. In Period 22, demand was 710, following recent values of 510, 542, 592, and 771. The 5-period average (P18-P22) is 625 units, which identifies the current seasonal regime. The SKU is currently experiencing persistent stock-outs (on-hand is 0 after Period 22), indicating that latent demand likely exceeds observed sales. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (orders from P14-P18 arrived exactly 4 periods later). My strategy is to set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture this 600+ unit demand regime, and stick with the promised lead time (L=4) as it has proven stable. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a high base stock level to satisfy the peak July/August demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: July demand peak sustained at >600 units; P18-P22 average is 625 units. Persistent stock-outs (P18-P22) confirm latent demand exceeds current supply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 24 (early August). Historically, swimsuit demand peaks in July and begins to taper in August. Although the July peak showed extreme demand (P18-P22 average ~625), Period 23 showed a sharp drop to 309, which may signal the start of the end-of-season decline. However, we must remain cautious as one data point is not a trend, and latent demand from previous stockouts might still exist. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With 527 units on-hand and 2499 in-transit, our pipeline is very full. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average of the peak (approx 568 units per period) while allowing for the start of the seasonal pivot, ensuring we cover the 4+1 period window without over-committing as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer transition detected: Period 23 demand (309) is significantly lower (-50%) than the P18-P22 average (625), potentially signaling the start of the seasonal decline for swimwear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-469.00

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 (mid-August). The latest demand data (Period 23: 309, Period 24: 176) confirms a significant seasonal decline from the July peak (average ~625). This aligns with the end of the peak swimwear season. On-hand inventory is currently high (1173) and in-transit inventory is substantial (1677), totaling 2850 units against a current demand regime that has dropped below 200 units/period. The pipeline already covers more than 10 periods of current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs during this drawdown phase, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P22-P24) to capture the downwards trend (avg ~398, though P24 was only 176). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to react to this reduction in volume and volatility, preventing further unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a July peak average of ~625 to 309 (P23) and 176 (P24), marking the end of the peak summer swimwear season. Current inventory is sufficient to cover late-season demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (mid-August), the swimwear seasonal peak has concluded. Demand has dropped significantly for three consecutive periods: 309 (P23), 176 (P24), and 132 (P25). The current on-hand inventory (1583) and in-transit units (1135) are more than sufficient to cover the remainder of the season given this sharp decline. My primary objective is to prevent further ordering and minimize holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent downward shift in demand, which will result in a lower base stock and allow the system to digest the existing inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a July average of ~625 to a 3-period average (P23-P25) of 205.6 units (-67%), signaling the end of the summer swimwear season.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (late August). Demand history shows a clear and significant decline as the peak summer swimwear season ends. From a July peak averaging >600 units, demand has dropped to a 4-period average (P23-P26) of 193 units. This downward trend is consistent with seasonal patterns for swimwear in the Northern Hemisphere as we approach autumn. Inventory is currently very high: On-hand (1851) + In-transit (712) total 2563 units. Even if demand stabilizes at ~150-200 units, we have over 12 periods of stock. My strategy is to set a conservative demand forecast (mu_hat) to prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the most recent seasonal drop (averaging ~193). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on all previous arrival data.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor: Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~150-200 units/period) following the peak July exit. Current stocks are excessive for late-year demand.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the clear post-peak seasonal decline for swimwear as of early September. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (average of 142 units over the last three periods) compared to the July peak of ~600+. On-hand inventory is currently 2,424 units, which is enough to cover over 15 periods of current demand levels. With no units in transit and a massive surplus relative to the new demand regime, the goal is to prevent any further ordering. I am setting L to default (4) and using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment. Given the high on-hand inventory, the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in zero orders, allowing us to bleed off the excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand floor confirmed: From P25-P27, demand has stabilized at a mean of 142 units/period, down from the July peak of ~625 (-77%).

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late post-peak season for swimwear (September). Demand has significantly dropped from the July peak of ~600 units to a current 4-period average (P25-P28) of 126 units. Period 28 saw a further drop to 78 units, suggesting the seasonal 'floor' is still declining as autumn approaches. On-hand inventory is extremely high (2,346 units) with zero in-transit, as orders were proactively stopped in Period 24. This inventory level covers approximately 18 periods of demand at the current rate, which is far beyond the (L+1) requirement. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend's base-stock calculation will result in zero orders, which is correct given the massive inventory surplus and declining seasonality.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season floor decline: Demand dropped to 78 in P28, bringing the 4-period average to 126 units (P25-P28); massive inventory surplus established for the remainder of the year.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in a deep seasonal decline as we reach mid-September. Demand has dropped significantly from the July peak (>600 units) to a current 5-period average (P25-P29) of 113.8 units, with the most recent demand being only 65 units. Inventory is extremely high (2,281 units) with zero in-transit, which is sufficient to cover approximately 20-30 periods of current demand levels. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00) and the massive overstock, the objective is to prevent any further ordering. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, while keeping L at default as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. The large on-hand inventory ensures the OR backend's base-stock calculation will not trigger new orders.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed: 5-period average (P25-P29) is 114 units, an 80%+ reduction from July peak levels. Massive inventory surplus (20+ periods of cover) exists for the remainder of the season.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 31 (Sept 23, 2019). The demand for this swimwear SKU has collapsed significantly from its July peak of ~625 units/period to a recent 3-period average of only 57.7 units (P28-P30). This confirms the seasonal exit. Current on-hand inventory is 2,251 units, which at the current demand rate of ~60/period provides approximately 37 periods of cover\u2014extending well beyond the remaining 15 periods of the year. No additional orders are required, and the goal is to minimize further holding costs. Because we have zero in-transit inventory and a massive surplus, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect this new low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from triggering any safety-stock-driven orders. N=3 is used for the recent regime calculation.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor lower than anticipated: P28-P30 average dropped to 57.7 units, a further 50% decrease from the late-August floor (~114 units).

Given the current demand levels, the existing stock provide over 50 periods of coverage, which far exceeds any foreseeable demand for the remainder of the calendar year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To minimize further holding costs and prevent unnecessary ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to reflect the current low-demand environment. The system will correctly place zero orders because the on-hand inventory is massively above the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed significantly lower: P29-P31 average is 43.3 units, a 93% decrease from the July peak regime (~625 units). Massive inventory surplus (2200+ units) will cover all demand for the remainder of the year.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's swimwear, which is now in a clear post-peak seasonal decline (October). Demand has plummeted from a July peak average of 635 units to a very low late-September/early-October regime. The most recent three-period demand average (P30-P32) is approximately 42.3 units. Currently, there is a massive on-hand inventory of 2,154 units with zero in-transit. Given the current demand levels, this provides over 50 periods of stock cover, which is far in excess of the remaining 12 periods in the game. To stop incurring unnecessary holding costs, no more units should be ordered. I will set the lead time to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 3 to reflect the current low demand regime, ensuring the OR engine's base stock calculation stays well below the current inventory level so that zero units are ordered.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed: 3-period average (P30-P32) is 42.3 units, indicating a 93% decrease from July peak levels. Inventory surplus is sufficient for all remaining game periods.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 34 (October), well past the summer peak for this swimwear SKU. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower regime; the average demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) is approximately 46 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 2,116 units, which, at the current low demand rate, provides over 40 periods of inventory coverage. With only 11 periods remaining in the game (out of 45), we have a massive inventory surplus that far exceeds any possible future demand this season. Therefore, no additional orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand environment, allowing the OR backend to naturally suppress ordering while we deplete the excess stock.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: P29-P33 average demand is 46.6 units, continuing the seasonal decline from the July peak of ~625. Current on-hand inventory (2116) covers all remaining game periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in a deep post-peak seasonal trough. Demand has stabilized at very low levels (P30-P34 average is 41.6 units) compared to the July peak (~625 units). The current on-hand inventory of 2073 units is extremely excessive, providing over 45 periods of coverage at current demand rates. Given the game ends at Period 45 (11 periods remaining) and the holding cost is $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, no further orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low-demand floor and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains below the current massive on-hand inventory, effectively resulting in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: P30-P34 demand average is 41.6 units, reflecting a 93% seasonal decline from summer peaks. Massive inventory surplus (2000+) covers all demand until the end of the game.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has effectively collapsed as we are now in late October (Period 36), well past the summer peak. The current demand regime (P31-P35) averages 45.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 2023 units, which provides approximately 44 periods of cover at current demand levels. Since there are only 9 periods remaining in the simulation (total 45 periods), the objective is to minimize holding costs by preventing any further orders. The OR backend's base_stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) minus pipeline inventory (on-hand 2023 + in-transit 0) will naturally result in zero orders as long as mu_hat is set appropriately to reflect the low-demand floor. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable, low-volume regime and keep L at default as no more orders are needed or intended.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor remains stable at ~45 units/period; inventory surplus of 2000+ units is sufficient to cover all demand until the game ends (Period 45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1843.00

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 37 (early November). Demand for the 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) has firmly settled into its winter trough. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 45.8 units per period, which is consistent with the established post-summer floor. Current on-hand inventory is 1987 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand levels, this inventory represents approximately 43 periods of cover, which exceeds the remaining 8 periods of the game (total 45 periods). Ordering any more units would only increase holding costs without contributing to additional sales. Therefore, I will maintain the 'default' lead time of 4 and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to reflect the current low-demand environment. The OR backend will see the high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock (calculated from these parameters) and correctly place zero further orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1817.00

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) is in its deep off-season period (November). Demand has stabilized at a very low floor, with the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaging 40.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 1,953 units, while total expected demand for the remaining 8 periods (P38-P45) is approximately 320 units (based on the current mean). This creates a massive inventory surplus of over 1,600 units that will not be cleared before the game ends. In order to minimize total holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining the required service level, I am setting parameters to ensure zero additional orders are placed. Setting L=4 (promised), mu_hat to a recent low average (N=5), and sigma_hat to the recent variation will result in a base stock well below the current inventory plus pipeline (1953 + 0), thereby preventing further orders and mitigating holding cost accumulation.

Carry-over insight: November demand floor stable: P33-P37 average demand is 40.2 units/period, representing a 94% reduction from July peak (~625 units). Significant inventory surplus (1953 units) covers approximately 48 periods of current demand, well beyond the game's end at P45.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its off-season floor regime as of mid-November. The demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) being approximately 43.4 units per period. This represents a 93% decrease from the July seasonal peak (~625 units). There is a massive inventory surplus (1,911 units on-hand), which provides over 40 periods of coverage at current demand levels, far exceeding the remaining 6 periods of the game (total periods = 45). No further orders are required. The OR parameters are set using recent history (N=10) to reflect this low-demand state and prevent any unnecessary ordering by the backend, maximizing profit by minimizing additional holding costs while disposing of existing stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40 (late November). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is in its extreme off-season floor regime. Demand has plummeted from July peaks of ~625 units to a very low and stable floor. The demand in Period 39 was only 17 units, and the 5-period average (P35-P39) is approximately 35.8 units/period. On-hand inventory is 1894 units with 5 periods remaining in the game (ending P45). At the current consumption rate, the existing stock covers over 50 periods of demand, making any further ordering unnecessary and detrimental to profit due to high holding costs ($1.0/unit). I will keep parameters at a level that results in zero orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals through P27. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand floor for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: November demand floor remains extremely low: P35-P39 average demand is 35.8 units/period, representing a 94% decline from July peak. Inventory surplus is sufficient to cover all remaining game periods through P45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1329.00

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 41 of 45, the product (swimwear) is in its deep off-season 'floor' regime. On-hand inventory is 1,781 units, while the recent 5-period average demand is approximately 48 units per period. Even accounting for the recent spike to 113 units in Period 40, the total projected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game is roughly 250-500 units. Carrying 1,781 units means we have a surplus of over 1,200 units that will incur holding costs ($1/unit/period) without any prospect of being sold before the game ends. Therefore, the primary objective is to prevent any further ordering. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to reflect the low current demand levels, ensuring the calculated base stock remains significantly below the current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: December demand floor persists: Despite a localized spike in P40 (113 units), the P36-P40 average remains low at 48.4 units, confirming a massive inventory surplus (1781 units) that will cover all demand through P45.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 42 of 45 (December 9th). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is in its deep off-season floor following a significant July peak. Current on-hand inventory is 1,730 units. Given that the recent demand regime (P36-P41) averages approximately 48 units per period, and there are only 4 periods remaining in the game (P42, P43, P44, P45), the total expected demand is roughly 192 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 1,730 units is massive, covering nearly 36 periods of demand\u2014well beyond the end of the simulation. Ordering any additional units would only increase holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) without generating additional sales or profit ($4.0/unit). Therefore, the goal is to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value (1) to ensure the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) remains significantly below the current inventory level of 1,730.

On-hand inventory is 1673 units, while the recent demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has averaged only 56 units per period. Even with a localized spike in P40, the inventory level is massive relative to the remaining demand for the final 3 periods. No further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent any triggered orders by keeping the base stock target well below the current on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 of a 45-period game (Date: 2019/12/23). The product is a swimwear item (Timeless Midrise Brief) which is currently in its off-season demand floor. Historical data shows that demand plummeted after the July peak and has remained consistently low, averaging approximately 50-60 units per period in December. My current on-hand inventory is 1615 units, which is enough to cover more than 25 periods of demand at the current rate. Since there is only one period left in the game and holding cost is $1.0/unit, any additional ordering would only incur unnecessary holding costs and provide no benefit to sales or profit. I will set the parameters to effectively minimize the base stock level, ensuring no new orders are placed for the final phase of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1330.00

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 45) of the game. The current on-hand inventory for the single SKU (599580017) is 1558 units. Historical demand in the current low-season regime (post-September) has averaged roughly 45-55 units per period. With only one period remaining and an ending on-hand inventory that can cover over 30 periods of current demand, no further orders are required. The strategy for this final period is to maintain zero new orders to avoid additional holding costs, which are $1.0 per unit per period. The parameters are set to their defaults or based on recent low-demand history to ensure the OR backend does not trigger a 'safety' order, although the massive inventory surplus (1558 units) relative to recent demand (P44: 57 units) makes any new procurement mathematically unnecessary and detrimental to the final profit score.
