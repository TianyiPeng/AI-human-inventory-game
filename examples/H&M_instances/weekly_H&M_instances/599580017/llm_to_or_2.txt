Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019/02/25) for a Women's Swimwear item (SKU 599580017). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], likely reflecting the beginning of a pre-summer seasonal surge as we enter late February/March. The most recent demand (213) is significantly higher than the average, indicating a growth regime. Since the lead time is promised at 0, I will use a conservative estimate for mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (average of [152, 129, 213] \u2248 164.7) to capture the trend without over-extending, as the backend OR applies a base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat calculation. I'll use sigma_hat from the last 3 periods to account for the increasing volatility seen in the data.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 175, which is higher than the historical average (130.6) and follows an upward trend [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175]. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and as we are currently in early March (2019/3/4), we are moving into the spring/summer peak season for this category. The actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods in Period 1. Since our on-hand inventory is low (27 units) relative to recent demand, and there are no units in-transit, we need a significant restocking order. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current stronger demand regime (averaging ~172) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the latter half of the demand history.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). We are currently in early March (Period 3). Historical demand and Period 1 & 2 demand show a clear upward trend compared to initial data points [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173]. The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 187 units. As we approach spring/summer, demand for swimwear is expected to remain high or increase. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for P1 and P2. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime, and default lead time settings as the 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Starting Period 1, demand increased significantly from an early average of ~130 to a recent 3-period average of ~187 (+43%), likely due to seasonal swimwear demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's midrise bikini bottom (Swimwear). The current date is March 18, 2019, which is a season-launch period for swimwear in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] (pre-period) followed by game demands of [175, 173, 181]. The last three observed periods have an average demand of approximately 176 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game average. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and high volatility. Given the 0-period lead time, base stock only needs to cover (1+L) = 1 period of demand (the current period).

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief), and we are currently in late March (2019/3/25), heading into the peak spring season. Historical data shows an upward demand trend: [175, 173, 181, 200]. The most recent demand (200) resulted in a stockout since inventory was only 180. The average demand over the last 4 periods is 182.25, but the last two periods show 181 and 200, indicating accelerating seasonal demand. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this upward shift while providing enough weight for variability. Lead time is consistently 0 (observed in periods 1-4). I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to ensure the base stock levels adapt to the higher demand level and the stockout seen in Period 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Trend is increasing into the spring season (Period 4 demand reached 200, exceeding inventory).

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear), and the current date is April 1st. Demand has shown a clear upward trend as we move into the spring/summer season: 175, 173, 181, 200, and 268. The last two periods (P4 and P5) resulted in stockouts, with Period 5 demand spiking significantly to 268 (+34% over P4). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the trend is accelerating, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent growth while weighting the recent stockout severely. Mu_hat needs to account for this continued seasonal rise, and sigma_hat must reflect the increased volatility seen in the transition from P4 to P5.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal demand growth confirmed: Demand rose from ~175 (P1-P3) to 200 (P4) and 268 (P5), a 50%+ increase over the initial baseline. Successive stockouts in P4 and P5 indicate the current inventory policy is under-forecasting the seasonal peak.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Timeless Midrise Brief' is experiencing a sharp seasonal surge as we enter spring (early April). Historical demands demonstrate a clear upward trajectory: P2: 173, P3: 181, P4: 200, P5: 268, and P6: 376. We have stockouted for three consecutive periods (P4-P6), and the demand gap is widening (sold 255 vs demand 376 in P6). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this rapid growth and avoid further lost sales during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat using EWMA with a high gamma (0.8) to prioritize the most recent observed demand of 376, while using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and potential for even higher demand in upcoming mid-April weeks.

Carry-over insight: Critical demand acceleration: Demand increased from 268 (P5) to 376 (P6), a 40% jump within one week. Third consecutive stockout confirms current backend parameters are failing to keep pace with the spring swimwear ramp-up.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear bottom (599580017) and we are currently in mid-April (Period 8). Historically, demand has surged from ~175 in February to a peak of 376 in April, representing a clear seasonal trajectory. We have experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (Periods 4-7) where demand exceeded the arrival quantity. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 5, demand was 268; in Period 6, it peaked at 376; and in Period 7, demand was 295 (though we only provided 285 units). Given the mid-April timing, we are likely at or near the pre-summer peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the high-volume Period 6 and 7 levels (average ~313), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen during this ramp-up phase. This targets a service level that avoids further stockouts during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: High-volume regime (avg ~313 units/period) established in periods 5-7. Successive stockouts (P4-P7) indicate the need for higher base stock levels to match seasonal swimwear velocity in April.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief) in April, currently in the middle of a steep seasonal ramp-up. Demand has consistently outstripped supply for five consecutive periods (P4-P8), resulting in stockouts. The inventory model's 'cap' and base stock calculations are lagging because they are weighted by lower historical demand. Demand in the last three periods (P6-P8) averaged 346 units (376, 295, 367). With a promised lead time of 0 (L=0) and actual lead time consistently 0, we need a mu_hat that covers at least the expected demand for the coming period to break the stockout cycle. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime (~346 units), while using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat reflects the high volatility seen in this growth phase. This combination will push the OR backend to raise the base stock level and increase the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged stockout cycle confirmed: 5 consecutive periods (P4-P8) where demand exceeded supply during the spring swimwear ramp-up. Peak seasonal demand is currently averaging ~346 units/period (P6-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is in a steep upward seasonal trend as we approach May. Period 9 demand reached 477, significantly exceeding the order of 384, resulting in the 6th consecutive total stockout. The demand has grown nearly 3x from Period 1 levels. Given the consistent stockouts, the observed lead time is confirmed as 0, but the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend (calculated as mu_hat / (1+L) + safety_stock) is likely restricting order quantities because mu_hat (based on historical mean) is lagging behind the actual seasonal surge. I will switch to 'explicit' mu_hat set to 500 (projecting a slight growth from P9's 477) and a higher 'explicit' sigma_hat of 100 to ensure the base stock and the cap allow for a sufficiently large order to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal acceleration: Demand reached 477 in Period 9, representing a 30% increase from the already high P8 demand (367). Total stockouts for 6 consecutive periods (P4-P9) demonstrate that historical averages and standard 'recent_N' methods are insufficient for this swimwear ramp-up.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '599580017' (Womens Swimwear) is in a steep upward seasonal trend as we enter May. Period 9 demand peaked at 477, and Period 10 demand remained high at 468. Although we finally broke the 6-period stockout streak in Period 10, the ending inventory of 117 is low relative to recent demand velocity. The demand has clearly shifted into a high-volume regime compared to the early periods (P1-P3 avg ~176). To capture this seasonal peak and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high demand volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to focus on the most relevant high-demand period (P8-P10). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Demand has plateaued at a high-volume regime (avg ~437 units/period for P8-P10), up from ~176 in early March. Stockout cycle broken in P10 after 6 weeks.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is midrise bikini bottoms, a seasonal swimwear item. We are currently in mid-May (Period 12), and historical demand shows a clear ramp-up from Period 1 (~175) to a peak in Period 9 (477). However, demand decreased in the two most recent periods: Period 10 (468) and Period 11 (332). This suggests we have passed the initial spring surge and may be entering a post-peak plateau or a slight cooling-off period before the heat of summer. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock calculation with a service level based on profit/holding cost, we need to balance the risk of overstocking as the season progresses against the high demand still observed. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand trend (avg ~425), which is lower than the absolute peak but higher than previous early-season estimates. The lead time L remains at 0 based on consistent history (ordered and arrived same period). For sigma_hat, N=5 is chosen to capture the higher volatility seen during the peak periods and ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak potential softening: After 6 periods of stockouts (P4-P9), demand has tapered from a high of 477 (P9) to 332 (P11), indicating the first seasonal ramp-up phase has concluded.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P9: 477, P10: 468, P11: 332, P12: 417) suggests that while the initial explosive growth phase (late April) has stabilized, demand remains in a high-volume seasonal plateau for late spring/early summer. The average demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is ~423 units. Using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat will capture this current regime without being delayed by the lower early-season numbers. For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=4 will appropriately reflect the current volatility (std deviation is ~65). Observed lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in a high-volume regime (avg ~423 units, P9-P12) following the April ramp-up. Actual lead time has remained stable at 0 periods throughout the season.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal demand period (late May). After a significant ramp-up in April, demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime. The last four periods (P10-P13) show demand values of 468, 332, 417, and 370, averaging approximately 397 units per period. The 0-period lead time remains consistent as per the 'conclude' messages. To maintain a sufficient service level during this peak without over-stocking as we approach the mid-summer plateau, I am selecting a recent_N window of 5 periods (P9-P13) to capture the current high-demand mean (~413) and volatility. This window includes the peak demand (477) to ensure sigma_hat provides adequate safety stock against potential late-season spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1864.00

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's swimwear (bikini bottoms). Historic data shows a strong seasonal ramp-up through April and May. In Period 14 (late May), demand spiked significantly to 525, exceeding on-hand inventory and resulting in a stockout. Period 15 (June 3) is a peak month for swimwear sales in North America/Europe. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 422, but the most recent figure (525) suggests the seasonal peak is still intensifying or fluctuating upward. Given the stockout in P14 and the entry into June, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast of 500 to ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet this high demand volume and prevent further lost sales. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the last 5 weeks (std dev is significantly larger than the early season baseline). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during the early June peak; the P14 demand of 525 represents a second peak exceeding the late April high (477).

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak summer season (June). Historical data shows high volatility with two distinct peaks: one in late April (477 units) and a second, higher peak in late May (525 units). The most recent demand (Period 15) dropped to 330 units, potentially indicating a post-peak correction or typical swimwear demand fluctuation. However, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which implies a high service level requirement, we must remain aggressive during June. The demand mean over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is 402 units, which captures the current high-volume regime better than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7) to stabilize the forecast around the current seasonal plateau while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the significant variance observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Second seasonal demand peak confirmed in late May (Period 14: 525 units). Demand remains highly volatile in June, oscillating between ~330 and ~525 units, requiring a high-volume base stock (avg ~400+).

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak season (June). Demand has remained high but volatile over the last 8 periods (P9-P16), averaging approximately 402 units per week, with a recent softening to ~316 units over the last two weeks (P15-P16). However, the high-demand peaks (477 in P9, 525 in P14) suggest that we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts during this critical period. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the average demand of the current high-season regime (approx 402), which balances the very high P14 peak with the more recent lower observations. For sigma_hat, N=8 will also be used to capture the significant volatility (std dev remains high) observed throughout the May-June period, ensuring the backend's safety stock calculation is sufficient for June's demand swings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1888.00

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear bottom (SKU 599580017) currently in its peak seasonal demand phase (late June). Recent demand history shows high volatility with a bifurcated pattern: periods of moderate demand (~300 units) interspersed with sharp peaks (P14: 525, P17: 517). The most recent period (P17) resulted in a stockout as demand (517) exceeded the starting inventory (472). Throughout the entire history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current high-demand regime and protect against frequent stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand dips, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4: P14-P17) to capture the average demand of approximately 418 units. Given the high standard deviation in recent periods (ranging from 302 to 525), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 to provide a robust safety stock buffer. This approach aims to maximize profit by minimizing lost sales during the peak swimwear season.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme during the June peak (Period 17: 517 units, following a dip to ~315 units). The high-volume regime is sustained but unstable, alternating between ~300 and ~520 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has entered a hyper-volatile phase as we enter July (Period 19). Period 18 saw an unprecedented demand spike to 771 units, an 49% increase from the previous high of 525. This suggests that the early summer peak is significantly more intense than the spring ramp-up. We have experienced a stockout in Period 18 because our order (520) was insufficient to meet the 771 units demanded. Given the critical timing (July 1st), we must prepare for sustained peak performance. I am shifting the mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 650 units (roughly the midpoint between the recent peak and the previous high-volume average) to ensure the base_stock calculation targets a much higher floor. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the massive increase in volatility observed over the last month (standard deviation has spiked along with mean). Constant confirmed lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand explosion confirmed: Period 18 demand reached 771 units, a 49% jump from prior peaks, indicating that July peaks for swimwear significantly exceed April/May levels.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak July swimwear season (Date: 2019/7/8). Historical demand shows a significant explosion in Period 18 (771 units) followed by a high sustain in Period 19 (592 units). The demand regime has clearly shifted upwards from the spring levels. The last two periods (P18, P19) yielded an average demand of 681.5 units. Given the high volatility (peak 771 vs dip 330 recently), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the most recent high-demand regime (P18-P19) to ensure we have enough stock for the July peak, as recent_N would still be heavily influenced by lower June numbers. Sigma_hat is set using a small recent_N (3) to capture current extreme volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed: Demand jumped to an average of 681.5 units across P18-P19, significantly higher than the April/May peaks (~450) and June levels (~400). This represents the primary annual peak for this SKU.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (woman's swimwear), currently at the peak of its summer season in mid-July (Period 21). Historical demand analysis shows a significant July peak: Period 18 (771), Period 19 (592), and Period 20 (542). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 635 units, which is a massive jump from the April/May average of ~430. Although the demand has slightly decreased from the extreme high of P18, it remains in a high-volume regime. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine needs to set a base stock that covers the current period's high demand. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat captures the current July peak (avg 635), while an explicit sigma_hat is necessary to handle the high volatility (swinging from 771 to 542). Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 650 (approx. 1 period of coverage) and a generous sigma_hat of 150 ensures sufficient safety stock for potential late-July heatwaves or seasonal surges, while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak sustained: Average for P18-P20 is ~635 units, significantly higher than the spring peak of ~450. High volatility persists alongside high volume.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak summer demand phase (July). Recent history shows a significant volume jump starting in Period 18, with demand averaging approximately 604 units over the last four periods (P18-P21: 771, 592, 542, 510). While the massive spike in P18 (771) has subsided, the current volume remains substantially higher than the spring peaks. The 'recent_N' method with N=4 is selected for mu_hat to capture this high-volume July plateau while adjusting for the slight downward trend from the 771 peak. sigma_hat is set with N=4 to account for the extreme volatility observed during this period (ranging from 510 to 771). With L=0 confirmed consistently, the base stock targets the immediate demand and provides a buffer against the high variance seen in this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak stabilized: Average demand for P18-P21 is ~604 units, a sustained high-volume regime significantly exceeding the April/May average of ~400. While P18 was an outlier spike (771), volume has remained above 500 for four consecutive weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) remains in its peak seasonal regime as of late July (Period 22). Current demand (710) significantly exceeded inventory, resulting in another stockout. While the July average is approximately 604 units (P18-P21), the recent jump to 710 and the earlier spike to 771 indicate that July contains the highest and most volatile demand peaks of the year. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the current stockout and capture remaining peak summer demand, I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-volume regime (P18-P22 average is ~625 units) and sigma_hat (standard deviation of the same period is ~108 units) to provide a sufficient buffer against the massive weekly fluctuations (330 to 770 range). This aggressive setting ensures the base stock is high enough to minimize lost sales during this high-profit seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak intensified: Late July (Period 22) saw a return to extreme high volumes (710 units), confirming that the seasonal peak is not tapering yet and remains highly volatile (range ~510-771 in the last 5 weeks).

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is entering August (P24, 2019/8/5). Following a sustained July peak where demand reached up to 771 units and averaged approximately 630 units (P18-P22), Period 23 saw a significant drop to 309 units. This suggests the primary summer peak is ending as the season transition begins. Historical data shows lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while holding costs are relatively high (stockout cost ratio is 0.8), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to reflect this recent downturn. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the end of the high Jul peak (P19-P22) and the first significant drop (P23), resulting in a smoothed but responsive transition to late-summer volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand transition observed: Demand dropped from a 5-period peak average of ~630 units (P18-P22) to 309 units in Period 23 (early August), signalling the conclusion of the primary summer peak.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) has clearly passed its primary summer peak. Demand dropped significantly from a 5-period average (P18-P22) of ~627 units to 309 units in P23 and further to 176 units in P24. This confirms a seasonal decline as we move into mid-August. Current on-hand inventory (480) is extremely high relative to the most recent demand (176), and keeping it as is would incur high holding costs. I am transitioning the forecast to a 'recent_N' model with N=3 to capture this sharp downtrend while maintaining a small buffer for late-season residuals. Using recent_N for both mean and sigma will allow the OR backend to rapidly adjust the base stock downward to reflect the new, lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand collapse confirmed: Post-July peak volume has dropped from ~627 units (P18-P22) to an average of 242.5 units (P23-P24), a decrease of over 60%. Seasonal transition to late-summer/fall regime is underway.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has entered a clear post-peak decline as summer concludes. Demand has dropped consistently from a July peak average of ~627 to 309, 176, and most recently 132 in the last three periods. This represents a significant contraction to a low-volume regime. My previous recent_N=3 for mu_hat captured some of this but was still over-forecasting (153 order for 132 demand). Given the sustained downward trend (nearly 80% drop from the peak), I am using N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to rapidly downscale the inventory levels. On-hand inventory is currently very high (501 units) relative to the new demand level (132), so the OR backend should naturally stop ordering to allow stock to deplete and avoid excessive holding costs in the off-season. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand stabilization: Demand has converged to an average of ~205 units over the last 3 periods (P23-P25), confirming the end of the summer swimwear cycle.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) has clearly exited its peak seasonal demand phase as of late August (Period 27). Demand has dropped from a July average of ~600 units to a consistent post-season baseline of ~154 units over the last three periods (P24: 176, P25: 132, P26: 155). With current ending on-hand inventory at 346 units, we already hold more than two weeks of supply relative to this new demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs during the off-season, parameters must reflect this structural shift. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture only the post-peak stability, bypassing the massive July outliers. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) has clearly exited its primary summer peak. Demand has plummeted from a July high average of ~630 units down to a stable post-season baseline. In the last 5 periods (P23-P27), demand values were [309, 176, 132, 155, 139]. Excluding the transitional drop in P23, the most recent four periods (P24-P27) show a very stable average of 150.5 units. With on-hand inventory at 207 units and demand trending around 150, current stock covers more than one period of sales. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid high holding costs ($1/unit) on a product with a relatively low profit margin ($4/unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this new low-volume regime and increasing sigma_hat slightly to provide a small buffer against residue volatility as the season fully closes.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand regime confirmed: Demand has stabilized at an average of ~150 units/period (P24-P27), down from peak July levels of ~600+.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has structurally transitioned from its summer peak (~600 units in July) to a significantly lower post-season regime. In the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has been [176, 132, 155, 139, 78], averaging approximately 136 units. The most recent demand (78) suggests further tapering. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 129 units, it nearly covers the current expected demand of ~136 units. To avoid overstocking during this clear downward seasonal trend, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume, while maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand stabilization confirmed: Demand has averaged ~136 units/period over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), signifying the end of the summer cycle and a return to baseline levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has successfully transitioned from its high-volume summer peak (July avg ~630) to a significantly lower post-season stable regime (late August/September). Demand over the last five periods (P25-P29) has been 132, 155, 139, 78, and 65, averaging approximately 114 units/period, with a clear downward trend as autumn begins. The most recent three periods (P27-P29) average ~94 units. Given this cooling trend, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat of 5 to capture this descent while acknowledging the lower floor of ~65-80 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 102 units, which is sufficient to cover the current demand level, avoiding unnecessary holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand decline confirmed: Late summer/early autumn demand has dropped further from the 150-unit stabilization level to a new floor of 65-80 units (P28-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has clearly entered its post-summer trough. Recent demand in Period 30 dropped significantly to 30 units, following a stabilization around 65-78 units in Periods 28-29. This downward trend aligns with the end of the swimwear season in late September. The 3-period average (P28-P30) is approximately 58 units, while the most recent observation suggests even lower traffic. Given the current on-hand inventory of 118 units, we already have approximately 2-4 weeks of coverage for this new low-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the backend to quickly adjust to this localized 'end-of-season' average (~58 units) and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor reached: Demand has dropped to 30 units in Period 30, following a step-down to ~70 units in early September (P28-P29). The new late-autumn regime is significantly lower than the post-peak stabilization of ~140 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has completed its seasonal cycle and reached its late-autumn floor. Over the last four periods (P28-P31), demand has been 78, 65, 30, and 35, averaging ~52 units. The last two periods specifically show a stabilization around 30-35 units. Given the transition from a highly volatile high-volume summer to a low-volume autumn/winter state, I am using a recent window (N=4) to capture this new floor while ensuring the OR backend reacts to the reduced mean and standard deviation. An 'L' of 0 is maintained as observed in all historical data. The current on-hand inventory of 83 units already covers more than two periods of the current demand level (~32/period), so the OR backend should naturally order very little or nothing to minimize holding costs while the inventory right-sizes to the new regime.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season floor confirmed: Demand for late September (P30-P31) has reached a low-volume baseline of ~30-35 units, following the post-summer decline.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear) is in a clear end-of-season decline. Current demand has dropped from summer peaks (>600) to a low-volume baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 54 units (78, 65, 30, 35, 62). The most recent demand (P32: 62 units) suggests a slight fluctuation above the 30-35 unit floor seen in P30-P31, but the overall trend remains low. On-hand inventory is currently 21 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to cover this new low-volume regime. Using recent_N=5 captures the drop throughout September efficiently. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the high-summer peaks.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has transitioned into a late-autumn baseline after the primary summer peak and several step-down phases. Period 33 demand was 38 units, and the average over the last four periods (P30-P33) is approximately 41.25 units. This represents a significant and sustained drop from the summer highs. On-hand inventory is currently 34 units. Given the lead time remains 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this low-volume regime. This will prevent over-ordering as the season concludes while maintaining high service levels for the residual demand.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn baseline stabilized: Demand has averaged ~41 units over the last 4 periods (P30-P33), establishing a clear end-of-season floor for this SKU.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has firmly entered a low-volume late-autumn regime. Following the significant drop from summer peaks, demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) with an average of approximately 42 units/period (30, 35, 62, 38, 43). The stockout risk is currently low, and the priority is to avoid accumulating excess inventory during this off-season period. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this new baseline, I am setting L to default (0 periods) and using a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current late-season demand characteristics while ignoring the massive summer outliers.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable, late-autumn demand regime following the summer peak. Demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has averaged 43 units per period (30, 35, 62, 38, 43, 50), with a slight upward drift in the most recent two weeks. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain optimal inventory while minimizing holding costs in this low-volume phase, I am selecting recent_N=6 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This period's demand (50) was slightly higher than the recent average, but remains well within the expected range for the current floor.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Swimwear) has reached its late-autumn/winter floor as expected. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) at an average of 42 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of 600+. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current date (Nov 4) and the product category, demand is expected to remain at this low-volume baseline until the next seasonal cycle begins. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=7 to capture this post-season floor accurately for both mean and standard deviation, ensuring we maintain a lean inventory (on-hand is currently 17, which is below the expected period demand).

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (swimwear) has transitioned through its annual lifecycle and is now firmly in a low-volume, late-autumn/winter baseline. For the last 8 periods (since P30), demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging 41 units per period (range 30-62). Most recent data from P36 and P37 shows demand of 36 and 34 units respectively, suggesting the current regime is stable and predictable. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=8) window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-season floor accurately while ignoring the high-volume summer data. This ensures we maintain a low inventory level consistent with the low demand, minimizing holding costs for this seasonal product.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime confirmed (P30-P37): Demand has stabilized at a low-volume floor, averaging approximately 41 units per period since October.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has stabilized into a late-autumn/winter low-volume regime. Since Period 30, demand has consistently fluctuated around a mean of approximately 41 units (averaging 41.1 across P30-P38). The most recent demand (P38) was 42 units. Given the stability of this floor and the confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the period since the volume floor was established at P30) to capture this baseline accurately. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=9) to account for the low volatility observed during this period. These parameters will maintain a lean inventory suitable for the off-season, minimizing holding costs while meeting the stable demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's swimwear, which is now in its late-autumn/winter off-season regime. Historical demand for the last 10 periods (P30-P39) has stabilized at a low-volume floor, averaging approximately 37 units per period, with a recent dip to 17 units in P39. The primary seasonal peaks (April/May and July) are long concluded. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs during this low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient service level for the $4 profit margin, I am using a recent_N approach (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current stabilized floor (approx. 37-40 units) while smoothing out minor week-to-week fluctuations. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn baseline further softened: Average demand for P35-P39 is 35.8 units, compared to the P30-P34 average of 41.6 units. The market remains in a stable low-volume winter regime.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, there was a sudden demand spike to 113 units, occurring on November 25th (Cyber Monday). This is a known high-volume retail event. Previous demands in this late-autumn/winter regime (P30-P39) averaged approximately 38 units. While this spike is significant, it is likely tied specifically to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional window rather than a permanent regime shift for swimwear in December. However, even excluding this peak, demand has been slightly more volatile recently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to incorporate the most recent baseline including the spike, while relying on the OR backend's service level calculation (q=0.8) to protect against further holiday-related volatility without overstocking for a permanent regime shift that isn't seasonally supported. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Observed demand spike (113 units) in Period 40 corresponds to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail event; however, the broad regime remains a low-volume winter baseline for swimwear.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak (P40: 113 units). Demand has since moderated to 51 units in P41. We are firmly in the winter off-season for swimwear, where the baseline demand (excluding holiday spikes) has stabilized at approximately 35-45 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering after a holiday spike while maintaining sufficient stock for the variable winter baseline, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (P34-P41, avg ~54 units) to capture both the baseline and the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use the last 8 periods to account for the increased variance introduced by the P40 spike, ensuring a robust safety stock without excessive holding costs given the $1/unit/period rate.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable low-volume winter regime for swimwear, with demand consistently averaging roughly 40 units per period (excluding the Black Friday spike in Period 40). Period 42 demand was 57, and Period 41 was 51, indicating a slight elevation from the November floor of ~35, likely due to pre-holiday or early cruise season interest. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this slight late-year demand uptick (avg ~60) while maintaining responsiveness to the low-season baseline. Sigma_hat with N=10 is used to account for the Period 40 outlier and general end-of-year volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for these minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Late-winter demand elevation: Demand has slightly increased from a November floor of ~35 units to an early December average of ~54 units (P41-P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 44), which is the week of Christmas. Historical demand has slightly elevated since the December 2 Black Friday spike (P40), moving from a November floor of ~35 units to an average of ~55 units (P41-P43). As the product is women's swimwear (bikini bottoms), we are in a low-volume winter regime, though a minor 'winter getaway' or gift-related bump is visible. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on the last three periods (P41-P43), demand is stable around 55 units. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slight late-December elevation while avoiding the distortive influence of the Black Friday outlier (113 units) and the earlier seasonal collapse. On-hand inventory is 23 units, meaning an order will be triggered to reach the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Late-winter minor demand elevation: Demand has stabilized at ~55 units per week in December (P41-P43), up from the November floor of ~35 units, potentially due to holiday travel or gifting.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is December 30th (Period 45). Demand for Women's Swimwear bottoms has stabilized at a late-winter baseline following a minor December elevation, likely due to holiday travel. Recent demand over the last four periods (P41-P44) has been consistent: [51, 57, 58, 57], averaging 55.75 units. This is a slight increase from the November floor (~35 units) but far below summer peaks. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized late-December regime. The OR backend will use these values with a 0.8 service level (Profit $4 / (4+1)) to balance holding costs against demand coverage.
