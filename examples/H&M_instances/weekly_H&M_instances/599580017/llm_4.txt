  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I must establish a baseline. The SKU 599580017 is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Women's Swimwear). The date is February 25, 2019. In the retail calendar, late February/early March marks the start of the 'Spring/Summer' (SS) fashion season and the lead-up to Spring Break, during which swimwear demand typically begins to rise. Historical demand samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] show a volatile but generally upward trend with a mean of ~130. Given the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and I have no in-transit units, I will target the higher end of the historical samples to account for potential seasonal upward momentum and avoid a stockout in the first period, while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.",

Historical demand samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] average 130.6. Period 1 demand was 175, which is higher than the average, likely reflecting the seasonal ramp-up. Current Situation: I ordered 150 units in Period 1 with a lead time of 0 (confirmed). All 150 units arrived and were sold, leaving zero on-hand inventory and 25 units of lost sales (demand was 175). Lead Time Analysis: Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). Strategy: I need to cover Period 2 demand and ensure I don't stock out again given the likely upward trend. If P1 demand was 175 and the last historical sample was 213, I should forecast conservatively towards the 200-220 range to capture the seasonal uptick while balancing the $1.00 holding cost.
