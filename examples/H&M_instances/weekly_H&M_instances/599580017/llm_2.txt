In the northern hemisphere, we are entering the pre-season for swimwear (spring break/early summer prep), which aligns with the historical demand samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] showing a clear upward trend. b) Historical average is ~130, but the last two points (152, 213) suggest a significant ramp-up. c) Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Orders placed now (P1) arrive in P3. d) Starting inventory is 0. I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). e) Given the rising trend, I expect P1-P3 demand to average around 180-220 units. Total needed = 3 * 200 = 600 units. To be safe against the upward trajectory and the fact that I start with nothing, I will order 650 units.",

Period 1 actual demand was 175, which is higher than the historical average but consistent with the upward trend in the samples. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The order for 650 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable in Period 4. d) Inventory: Current on-hand is 0, so we lost 175 sales in Period 1. We have 650 units in transit. e) Order Logic: We need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1). With an estimated demand of ~180-200 per period, we need ~540-600 units to cover the pipeline. Since 650 are already coming in Period 3/4, we are currently covered for the immediate lead time. However, to maintain a rolling inventory and prevent stockouts in Period 5/6, I will place a smaller order now to maintain the flow, accounting for the seasonal ramp-up.",

In the retail calendar, mid-March is the start of the 'Spring Break' and pre-summer season, typically driving a sustained increase in swimwear demand as customers prepare for vacations. (b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples averaged ~130. However, the first three periods of 2019 show consistent demand of 175, 173, and 181 (average 176). This confirms a significant upward shift from historical levels, likely due to seasonality.

(d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 296. In-transit = 200 (Ordered in P2, expected to arrive during P4 and visible in P5). Total Pipeline = 496. (e) Order Logic: To cover demand for the next two periods (P4 and P5) at a rate of ~180/period, I need ~360 units. Current pipeline (496) is sufficient to cover this.

The average is 182, with a clear upward trend in the most recent period (200), likely due to seasonal acceleration. c) Lead time: Based on Period 2's conclude message, the actual lead time was 1 period (Order P1 arrived in P2), which is shorter than the promised 2. I will plan for a 1-2 period lead time window to be safe. d) Inventory: On-hand is 96. In-transit consists of 200 units (ordered P2, expected P3 or P4 but not yet arrived - likely a lead time variance or 2-period lead time) and 50 units (ordered P4). The P2 order of 200 units is critical; if lead time is 2, it should arrive this period (P5). Total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 346. e) Order logic: With demand around 200 units/period and a lead time of 1-2 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 5 and Period 6 (the soonest an order placed now could arrive).

The average of the last 3 periods is ~313. Given the mid-April date, demand is expected to remain high or continue increasing towards a seasonal peak. c) Lead Time vs. Missing Orders: Observed lead times have been 1, 3, and 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, orders from P5 (200), P6 (650), and P7 (650) are in transit (total 1500). P5 (ordered P5, promised P7) is now 1 period overdue. P6 (ordered P6, promised P8) should arrive during this period. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline is 1500 units. If P5 and P6 arrive this period, we gain 850 units. If only P5 arrives, we gain 200. If nothing arrives, we stock out again. e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for the lead time (2) + current period + safety stock (total 4 periods).

Current date is April 22nd, heading into the peak summer season in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand is trending strongly upward as customers prepare for vacations. (b) Demand Regime Analysis: Demand in the last 4 periods (P5-P8) has averaged 326 units (268, 376, 295, 367), significantly higher than the initial average of 174. The trend is volatile but generally increasing. I will forecast demand at approximately 350-400 units per period. (c) Lead Time vs. Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2 periods.

Demand over (L+1)=3 periods is ~1050-1200 units. (e) Final Order Logic: While the pipeline (2000) technically covers 5-6 periods of demand, the current on-hand is 0, and lead time volatility has caused significant lost sales in P6, P7, and P8.

  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear item (midrise brief) in the deep off-season (December). Demand has stabilized at a low-velocity regime, typically between 20-50 units per period, with occasional transient spikes (e.g., Period 40). Period 41 demand was 51 units, which resulted in a stock-out of the remaining 28 units on-hand. There is an order of 100 units from Period 41 currently in-transit, which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods based on historical lead time volatility (1-3 periods). Given that there are only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (total 45) and the current off-season regime is low, the 100 units already in-transit are sufficient to cover the remaining demand (estimated at ~160 units total for P42-P45) without incurring excessive holding costs or risking major stock-outs. No additional order is placed this period to avoid ending the game with surplus inventory.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). We are currently in mid-December (Period 43), which is the deep off-season for this category. Demand has stabilized into a low-velocity regime, typically ranging between 30-60 units per period, with occasional transient spikes (like P40). Current on-hand inventory is 0. An order of 100 units was placed in Period 41 and, based on the historical erratic lead time (1-3 periods), is expected to arrive in Period 42 or 43 (appearing in the Period 43 or 44 conclude message). Given that there are only 3 periods remaining in the game (43, 44, 45) and we are facing a high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), overstocking is a significant risk. In-transit shows 2300 units, but 2200 of those are confirmed lost from previous months (P12-P22). The only valid in-transit is the 100 units from P41. If that arrives, it covers nearly two periods of current demand. I will order a small amount (50 units) to ensure coverage for the final periods while minimizing the risk of holding excess stock at the game's end.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). Current period is 44 (Dec 23), which is deep off-season for swimwear. Historical demand for the last few periods (P41-P43) has been between 51 and 58 units, showing a slight uptick compared to the October/November lows of ~30-40, possibly due to winter getaway shopping or early holiday sales. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory consists of an order from P41 (100 units) and P43 (50 units). The P41 order is now at L=3 (within the observed 1-3 period lead time) and is expected to arrive during P44's arrival phase. This would provide 100 units to meet P44 demand (estimated at ~60 units) and P45 demand. Given that P45 is the final period and the pipeline (150 units) already covers the likely demand for both remaining periods (~120 units total), no further orders are necessary. Ordering now would result in ending inventory at P45, incurring holding costs without the possibility of future sales.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms) entering the deep off-season (late December). Current demand is low but stable, averaging approximately 55-60 units per period over the last three weeks. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory technically shows 2350 units, but 2200 of these (from Periods 12-22) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on the carry-over history. The recent orders are: P41 (100 units, 4 periods ago) and P43 (50 units, 2 periods ago). Given the maximum observed lead time for successful arrivals is 3 periods (P35 arrived in P38, P39 arrived in P40), the P41 order is likely lost. The P43 order is expected to arrive this period (P45) or next (P46). To cover demand for the next 3 periods (Lead time + 1) at the current rate of ~60 units/period, I need approximately 180 units. With 0 on-hand and only 50 units likely to arrive soon, I will order 150 units to replenish stock and maintain a small safety buffer for the start of the new year, while being mindful of the $1 holding cost during this low-demand period.",
