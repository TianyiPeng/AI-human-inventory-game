Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Today's date is 2019/2/25, which marks the beginning of the pre-summer demand ramp-up for swimwear. Recent demand history shows a steady increase: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213]. The most recent value (213) is significantly higher than the average, indicating a clear seasonal trend. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of all samples (~130) would result in a mu_hat of ~650, which captures the growth but might be conservative given the 213 spike. However, since the OR engine uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), and we currently have 0 on-hand/0 in-transit, we need a robust initial order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth trend (avg 164.6) which puts mu_hat at ~823. I will use 'default' for L (4) and sigma_hat until we observe actual lead times and variance.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (early March). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Historical demand over the last six periods (including Period 1) shows a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175]. The average of the most recent samples suggests a significantly higher demand baseline than the full history. Given that we are entering the spring season, demand for swimwear is expected to continue rising. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 260 units in-transit (ordered P1, promised L=4). Period 1 demand was 175, but 0 were sold due to lack of stock. To recover and prepare for seasonal growth, I will use a recent demand window (recent_N=5) to capture the higher mean and volatility. I am setting L to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to suggest the lead time is anything other than the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Given the dates (late February to early March), we are entering the pre-summer ramp-up for swimwear. Current demand for P1 and P2 was 175 and 173 units respectively, which is significantly higher than the training data (avg ~130). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 486 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). To protect against the stockout until arrivals, I will use a recent demand window. Recent N=2 captures the jump from the pre-game average (~130) to the current level (~174). I will use L=default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Avg increased from ~130 to 174 (+33%) starting Period 1, consistent with seasonal ramp-up for swimwear in March.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (Womens Swimwear) is in a seasonal upswing as we enter mid-March. Demand over the last 3 periods has been very stable and elevated (175, 173, 181), averaging 176.3 units, compared to the pre-game average of ~130. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 663 units in-transit. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected given the promised lead time (L) of 4. Per the lead-time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). Since there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise, I will use the default L=4. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient for L+1 (5) periods of demand (~880 units), leading to an order that closes the gap between the pipeline (663) and required stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: P1-P3 avg demand is 176.3 (+35% vs historic mean), consistent with March swimwear seasonality.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's swimwear bottom, which is entering peak seasonality for Spring/Summer. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks [175, 173, 181, 200, 213] (including the very last seed period) shows a significant and sustained increase over the pre-simulation average of ~130. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 4 simulation periods is 182.25. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (after this decision) and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 847 units in transit, we must ensure our parameters reflect the current high-demand regime to maintain a sufficient base stock. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current swimwear season's demand and volatility, while keeping L at default until we confirm the actual lead time via conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed swimwear demand regime shift: Avg demand for March (P1-P4) is 182.25 units, significantly higher than pre-simulation levels (+40%).

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are forecasting for Period 6 (April 1st). The product is 'Women's Swimwear,' which is entering its peak season in spring. The carry-over insights and historical data show a significant upward shift in demand: Period 1-4 averaged 182 units, but Period 5 jumped to 268 units. Given the seasonality, this jump is likely a sustained shift into the peak season rather than an outlier. Inventory is currently critical: the first shipment of 260 units arrived in Period 5 and was immediately sold out, leaving 0 on-hand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). We have a large pipeline of 675 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5), with the P2 order (226 units) expected to arrive in Period 6. To protect against the increasing demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand periods (181, 200, 268; avg ~216). This will ensure the base stock calculation targets the current peak-season trajectory while the backend OR logic balances the high holding cost ($1) against the profit ($4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for peak swimwear season: Period 5 demand reached 268 units (+47% vs P1-P4 avg). April demand is expected to remain at or above this level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $904.00

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak swimwear season (April). Period 6 saw a significant demand spike to 376 units, confirming a continuing upward trend (Avg P1-P4: ~182; P5: 268; P6: 376). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 731 in-transit. Based on the delivery pattern (P5 and P6 arrivals), actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. The demand regime has shifted upward aggressively. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent acceleration (P4-P6 average demand is approx 281), while sticking to the calculated lead time which matches observations. Ensuring mu_hat reflects this higher 'peak' state is crucial to avoid stockouts, as we have already experienced back-to-back stockouts where demand exceeded on-hand arrivals (P5 demand 268 > 260 arrival; P6 demand 376 > 226 arrival).

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal acceleration: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (200 -> 268 -> 376), with Period 6 demand 106% higher than the Period 1-4 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (mid-April), which is peak season for women's swimwear. Demand has been extremely high and consistently exceeds current arrivals: Period 6 demand was 376 and Period 7 was 295. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand is outstripping supply as it arrives. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P3 order arrived in P7). Total pipeline inventory is 982 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). To capture the 2019/4 seasonality, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat [268, 376, 295] to project (1+L) periods forward. This accounts for the sharp seasonal spike while providing sufficient base stock to clear the current backlog of lost sales. mu_hat target = (1+4) * mean(268, 376, 295) \u2248 1565. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Mid-April peak swimwear season confirmed: demand volatility is high with a 3-period mean of 313, significantly exceeding early March levels (+70%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in its peak season (late April). Historical demand has significantly accelerated from early March (~175) to mid-April (~367). Recent demands (P6: 376, P7: 295, P8: 367) show a new, higher-volume, higher-variance regime. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (P5-P8 arrivals all confirmed L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding recent arrivals. To cover demand across the Review + Lead time (1+4=5 periods), mu_hat must reflect this seasonal surge. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma, focusing on the last three periods (mean: 346, std: ~44) to capture the current peak intensity. This will prompt the OR engine to order enough to secure stock for the remaining high-demand spring/summer window.

Carry-over insight: Peak season regime shift confirmed (P6-P8 average: 346), representing a 90% increase over initial P1-P3 levels (~180). Sigma is elevated due to higher volume and variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal ramp-up as of late April (2019/4/29). Demand has shown a significant and sustained upward trend, with the most recent demand (477) being the highest recorded. The last three periods (P7-P9) have an average demand of 379.67 units, while the last five periods (P5-P9) average 356.6 units. Given the transition into May, I expect demand to remain at these elevated levels or increase slightly before plateaus. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand), leading to significant lost sales because previous orders (placed when demand was lower) are insufficient to meet current peak demand. The actual lead time has consistently stayed at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P5 arrival of the P1 order). I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-volume regime while smoothing for the extreme volatility seen in P9. This will set a base stock level that targets covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 1783 units), factoring in the large pipeline in-transit (1536 units).

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak swimwear season: Demand has surged from an average of ~180 (P1-P3) to ~380 (P7-P9), a >100% increase. Period 9 demand (477) indicates high-velocity season is in full effect. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (May 6th), the peak of the swimwear season. Product 599580017 (Midrise Brief) is experiencing high-velocity demand characteristic of late spring. Historical demand in the most recent regime (P5-P10) shows a mean of 375 with significant growth, culminating in demands of 477 and 468 in the last two periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P6. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand is outstripping previous lower-volume orders. To protect against stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P7-P10) to reflect the recent high-volume plateau (~400 units/period). I will use the last 6 periods for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility. L remains default (4), which implies a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, approximately 2000 units total (on-hand + in-transit).

Carry-over insight: May peak demand regime confirmed: P9-P10 demand stabilized at ~470 units, representing the seasonal peak for women's swimwear bottoms.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May, which is the peak demand season for swimwear. Observing the history, demand shifted from ~180 (P1-P3) to ~470 (P9-P10). Period 11 saw a drop to 332, but this may be a temporal fluctuation within the peak window or the start of a slight normalization from the absolute peak; however, demand remains significantly higher than early season data. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 96 and a large pipeline (1743 units), the goal is to maintain current velocity while accounting for the high demand seen in recent weeks. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the high-demand regime of late April and early May (332, 468, 477, 367), ensuring we cover the (L+1=5) period requirement for this high-velocity swimwear SKU.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late May, during the peak season for women's swimwear (SKU 599580017). Recent demand history indicates a sustained high-velocity regime with samples [477, 468, 332, 417]. While Period 11 saw a slight dip (332), Period 12 recovered to 417, confirming demand remains significantly elevated compared to the early season (P1-P4 avg ~182). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P8 order arrived P12). Given the seasonality of swimwear, we expect high demand to persist through June. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this peak demand level (~423.5 per period), ensuring that the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for nearly 2,118 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to manage the increased volatility observed during the peak season. On-hand is low (85), but the pipeline is strong (1690), so these parameters will help maintain availability without excessive over-ordering as we move through the peak.

Carry-over insight: Late May demand remains in the peak regime: P9-P12 average demand is 423.5, maintaining the ~130% increase over pre-season levels observed in March.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (Late May), demand for women's swimwear remains in its high-season peak regime. Recent demand (P9-P13) has averaged 392.8 units, showing some stabilization after the initial April surge. The most recent period (P13) saw demand of 370 units, slightly below the 400+ peak but still consistent with the seasonal high (~130% above pre-simulation levels). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 135 units and a healthy in-transit pipeline of 1738 units (reflecting larger orders placed P10-P13), the goal is to maintain the base stock level to cover the 4rd-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5). I will use the last 5 periods (P9-P13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current peak regime best while allowing for the slight cooling/stabilization observed in the last two weeks of May.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2089.00

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a midrise bikini brief (swimwear bottom), currently in its seasonal peak as we enter June. Demand has been high and sustained throughout May, with Period 14 showing a spike to 525 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is 414.8 units, compared to the earlier March/April levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P10 order arrived in P14). On-hand inventory is low (11 units), but a large order of 516 units (from P11) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current Period 15. To maintain stock during this high-velocity June period, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current peak demand regime (approx 415 units/period), covering the 5-period risk window (L+1). L remains at 4 (default) as lead times are stable. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent high volatility observed during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: June entry confirms peak swimwear demand regime: Average demand for P11-P14 is 411 units, which is 150%+ higher than initial pre-season observations. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16 (June 10), which is the height of the summer swimwear season. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P9-P15) shows a high-velocity regime with an average demand of approximately 417 units. Period 15 demand was 330, and Period 14 was 525, indicating significant volatility (sigma) alongside the high mean. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods (P11 arrived in P15). Given the product category (Womens Swimwear), we expect this peak demand to sustain through June and July. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture this peak season mean (~417 per period, projecting to 2085 for L+1) and use recent_N for sigma to account for the heightened volatility observed during this volume spike. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers (~5 periods) of demand, factoring in the current 197 on-hand and 1681 in-transit units.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-June (Period 17), which remains a peak period for swimwear. Reviewing recent demand (P11-P16: 332, 417, 370, 525, 330, 302), the average is approximately 379 units. While the last two periods (330, 302) are slightly lower than the May peak, volatility remains high (sigma). Historically, lead time has been rock-solid at 4 periods across all 12 observed deliveries. I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in this performance. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current June performance levels while disregarding the lower early-season numbers. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=6 to reflect the current high-demand variance. Pipeline inventory is currently 1679 units, which covers about 4.4 periods of demand at the current average, meaning the order will be appropriately moderated by the backend capping logic while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: June swimwear demand regime stabilized around 380 units (P11-P16 avg: 379), slightly lower than May peak of ~470 but consistently 150%+ above pre-season levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 24). The product is a swimwear bottom, currently in its peak summer season. Historically, demand for swimwear remains strong through June and July before tapering in late August. Recent demand observations show high volatility: Period 17 saw a spike to 517 units, while the average for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 409 units. The lead time has been exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods for all 13 concluded shipments. I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in this observed stability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering roughly the last 7 weeks from mid-May to late June) to capture the current high-demand 'peak summer' regime, which averages ~400 units per period. This ensures the base stock calculation (Target = (L+1) * mu_hat + Safety Stock) is robust against the current seasonal velocity while holding enough safety stock for the high variance (sigma) observed during these peak weeks.

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering July (Period 19), with the demand context being 'Timeless Midrise Brief' swimwear. Period 18 saw a massive demand surge to 771 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (P13-17) of approximately 409 units. This spike suggests a late-season July peak or high demand volatility as summer reaches its height. Despite the 771 units demanded, we only sold 508 due to stockouts, ending Period 18 with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the recent demand surge, I will use recent_N (N=5) for the mean to capture the upward momentum (P14-P18 avg: 489 units/period) and for sigma to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation has increased with the 771 outlier). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock capable of covering 5 periods (L+1) of this higher-velocity demand regime.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge detected: Period 18 demand (771) is ~88% higher than the P13-P17 average (409), indicating a mid-summer peak or inventory-constrained volatility shift.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in July, the peak period for swimwear. In Period 18 and 19, we observed a massive demand surge (771 and 592 units respectively), which is significantly higher than the mid-season average of ~400. This suggests a late-summer peak or clearance-driven demand spike. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 502 units. Given the high stockout risk recently (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last two periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this higher volume. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to reflect the increased volatility (from 300 to 700+). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand spike confirmed: Average demand for early July (P18-P19) increased to 681 units, up ~70% from the June average of ~400. Stockout risk is high.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (July 15), the peak of the summer swimwear season. Demand has surged significantly in the last three periods (P18-P20), with an average of 635 units, compared to the June average (P14-P17) of approximately 415. The most recent demand (P20: 542) followed an extreme spike in P18 (771). We are currently stock-holding constrained (On-hand: 0), having stockouted in the last three periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (2294) reflects large orders placed in P17-P20 to chase this summer surge. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for high July volatility, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current summer peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets the projected 600+ units per period demand level.

Carry-over insight: High-summer demand spike sustained: Average demand for July (P18-P20) is 635 units, a ~50% increase over the June peak-season average of ~415. Stockouts occurred in P18, P19, and P20 due to demand exceeding arrival capacity.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-to-late July period (Period 22), which is the absolute peak season for women's swimwear bottoms. Demand has spiked significantly in the last four periods (P18-P21), with an average demand of 603 units, compared to the June average of approximately 400. Stockouts have occurred consistently from Period 18 through Period 21 because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods prior) have been insufficient to meet this mid-summer surge. Specifically, Period 21's arrival of 124 units (ordered in Period 17) was drastically lower than the actual demand of 510, leading to an ending inventory of zero. The pipeline inventory is now very high (3004 units) as we aggressively ordered in response to the July spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To stabilize the inventory position while accounting for this high-velocity regime, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the summer peak demand and its associated volatility. This will ensure our base stock level reflects the 600+ unit demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Average demand for P18-P21 reached 603 units, a 50% increase over the June baseline of ~400. Extreme stockouts occurred due to low arrivals in P18-P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-to-late July peak season for swimwear. Period 22 demand was 710, following 510, 542, 592, and 771. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 625 units, confirming a significant upward shift from the June average of ~400. We have experienced consistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 5 consecutive periods) because the orders placed previously (based on lower June demand) were insufficient for this July surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the P18 order arriving in P22). To capture this higher demand regime and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (representing the July surge) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility observed during this peak. This will increase the base stock level to better match the current demand velocity.

Carry-over insight: High-summer demand regime (July) calculated at avg 625 units (P18-P22), representing a 50%+ increase over June levels; sustained stockouts occurring due to previous under-ordering.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 24 (August 5). The product is a swimwear bottom, which experienced a massive demand surge in July (Periods 18-22 averaged 625 units/period), causing significant stockouts. However, Period 23 saw a sharp drop in demand to 309 units. August typically marks the transition out of the high-summer peak into a late-season regime. Historical demand for P18-P23 averages 572 units, but the most recent observation suggests a cooling trend. To avoid excess holding costs on a seasonal item while protecting against residual summer demand, I will transition mu_hat to a more recent average (N=6 includes the July peak and the August drop) rather than the longer-term peak average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The high in-transit quantity reflect the aggressive ordering during the July stockout phase, which is now arriving and must be managed to avoid overstocking in the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand shift: Period 23 demand (309) is significantly lower (-50%) than the July 4-period average (~625), signaling the start of the end-of-season decline for swimwear.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, signaling the end-of-season transition for swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief). The demand has dropped significantly over the last two periods, from a July high-peak average of ~625 units to 309 in P23 and 176 in P24. This confirms a downward seasonal regime shift as summer ends. On-hand inventory is healthy at 1136 units, and there are substantial in-transit units (1857 total, including an 834-unit order arriving next period). To avoid over-ordering and incurring significant holding costs during this decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P22-P24) to reflect the recent collapse in demand. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a July average of ~625 to 242.5 (avg P23-P24), a ~60% reduction. Inventory levels are now high relative to this new demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1310.00

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for swimwear has entered a sharp post-summer decline. From a July peak average of 625 units, the demand in the last three periods (P23-P25) has dropped to 309, 176, and 132 respectively, representing a ~79% decrease from peak. Carry-over insights confirm this regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory (1838) and in-transit units (1023) are extremely high relative to this new demand level. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target driven by a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.8), the system needs to bleed off excess inventory to minimize holding costs. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent downward trend (average ~205), and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for the high volatility seen during the transition from peak to trough. This will likely result in zero new orders until the existing stock is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand collapse confirmed: Demand dropped from a July average of ~625 to an August average (P24-P25) of 154 units (-75% decline).

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has entered a post-season collapse. The demand dropped from a July average of ~625 to a current August average (P23-P26) of 193 units, with the most recent week at 155. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,917 units, while in-transit stock is 789 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the current demand is approx. 155-200 units, the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory cover over 13 periods of demand, significantly exceeding the (L+1) = 5 period requirement. Consequently, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand decline by using recent_N=4 (N=4 includes the start of the decline in P23 through P26) and L=4 to ensure the OR backend's capped policy results in zero orders due to high inventory surplus.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early September (2019/9/2), transitioning into the post-summer low season for swimwear. Demand has collapsed from July's high (avg ~625) to a consistent low-level regime over the last four periods (P24-P27 avg: 150.5 units). Meanwhile, previous large orders from the July peak have continued to arrive, ballooning on-hand inventory to 2,424 units. With a current demand rate of ~150 units per period, the existing on-hand inventory covers approximately 16 periods\u2014far exceeding the lead time and the remaining game duration. Consequently, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering due to volatility, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 4 periods (P24-P27) to reflect the new low-demand regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods as deliveries have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand regime fully established (P24-P27): average demand has stabilized at 150.5 units, a 75% reduction from July peak levels. High on-hand inventory (2000+) will likely suffice for the remainder of the season.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering September, which represents the deep post-season for swimwear. Historical demand has collapsed from a July peak of ~600 units to an average of ~125 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), with the most recent demand being just 78 units. The on-hand inventory of 2,489 units is massive relative to this new post-season regime (covering roughly 20 periods of current demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high existing inventory, the objective is to stop all ordering and allow on-hand stock to deplete. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the collapse, and use the default lead time. The OR backend will see that the pipeline plus on-hand inventory far exceeds the base stock and will order 0 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand collapse deepens: Period 28 demand (78) is the lowest recorded since the start of the simulation, confirming a sub-100 unit demand regime for September.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has entered a post-season collapse. Mid-September (Period 30) data shows demand consistently dropping from the July average of ~625 to a new low of 65 in Period 29. The current on-hand inventory is 2424 units, which, at the current average demand of 100-150 units per period, is enough to cover over 15 periods\u2014well beyond the end of the simulation (Period 45). To minimize holding costs while avoiding further unnecessary stock accumulation, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) to reflect this new low-demand regime, which currently averages ~114 units. Given the massive inventory surplus (2424 on-hand vs. a required base stock of approx. 570 for 5 periods), the OR backend will correctly stop ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-season demand floor established: September demand has stabilized at a sub-100 unit regime (P28-P29 avg: 71.5), significantly lower than the August post-peak average of ~150.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in Period 31 (late September). Demand for the product (Timeless Midrise Brief, a swimwear bottom) has entered a terminal seasonal decline. In the most recent periods (P28-P30), demand has dropped significantly to 78, 65, and 30 units respectively. This follows a post-peak stabilization in August of ~150 units. The current on-hand inventory is 2394 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, and we are at Period 31 out of 45, the current inventory is extremely excessive for the remaining 14 periods of the game, especially since demand is below 50 units/period and likely to stay low or continue declining as autumn progresses. Any further ordering would significantly increase holding costs without contributing to sales. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the most recent 3-period demand regime (N=3) to reflect this low floor, and the backend order logic will naturally result in zero orders because existing inventory (2394) massively exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor reached in September: Demand has dropped below 50 units (P30: 30), significantly lower than the August post-peak average of ~150.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in late September (Period 32). Demand has collapsed as expected for a seasonal swimwear SKU, with the most recent four periods (P28-P31) averaging 52 units, confirming a deep off-season regime. Current on-hand inventory is 2,359 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high (covering over 45 periods of current demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive inventory surplus, the goal is to prevent any further ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current low-demand environment, which will result in a base stock level significantly below the current on-hand inventory, effectively halting all new orders while the system bleeds off excess stock.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 33 (October 7th), well past the summer peak season for this swimwear SKU. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower 'post-season' floor. The last five periods (P28-P32) show demand values of [78, 65, 30, 35, 62], resulting in an average of 54 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 2,297 units, which, even at the peak August demand levels (~150), would last for over 15 periods. At the current demand rate (~54), this inventory will last over 40 periods, which exceeds the remaining 12 periods of the simulation. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains significantly below our current on-hand plus in-transit inventory, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: P28-P32 average demand is 54 units, a further decline from the September average of ~70. On-hand inventory is extreme (2000+) relative to current demand.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Swimwear bikini bottoms) is in a deep post-season demand floor. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with an average of approximately 46 units per period over the last five periods (P29-P33). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 2,259 units, which is enough to cover the current demand regime for approximately 50 periods\u2014well beyond the remaining 12 periods of the simulation. No new orders have been placed since Period 24, and no further arrivals are expected as 'In-transit' is 0. Parameters are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this low-volume floor, ensuring no new orders are triggered by the backend while the system works through the existing surplus.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in Period 35 (late October). As a swimwear bottom, the product has transitioned from its high-summer peak in July (avg ~625) through an August decline (avg ~150) into a very low October/off-season floor. The recent 5-period average demand (P30-P34) is 41.6 units, reflecting this floor. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 2,216 units with no in-transit orders. Given that the simulation ends in Period 45, and current inventory covers over 50 periods of off-season demand, the priority remains strictly on inventory liquidation by placing zero orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. For OR parameters, I am using recent_N (N=7, P28-P34) to isolate the post-September demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the system recognizes the low-demand environment and does not attempt to restock.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: P30-P34 average demand is 41.6 units, indicating the minimum seasonal baseline for late-year swimwear demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has firmly entered its off-season trough, with October demand averaging approximately 45 units per period. The current on-hand inventory of 2,166 units is extremely high, covering nearly 48 periods of demand at the current rate, which exceeds the remaining 9 periods of the simulation. No further orders are required. The OR parameters are set using the most recent 6 periods (P30-P35) to accurately reflect this low-demand, low-volatility regime and prevent the backend from triggering unnecessary replenishment. Holding costs are the primary concern now, as stockout risk is non-existent.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear bottom) has entered its off-season floor as of November. Period 36 demand was 36 units, consistent with the late October/early November average (P32-P36 avg: 45.8). The current on-hand inventory is 2130 units with 0 in-transit. Given that demand is now stabilized at a very low level (approximately 40-50 units per period) and there are 2130 units on hand, the current stock is sufficient for over 40 periods, far exceeding the 9 periods remaining in the simulation (ends at P45). To minimize holding costs, no further orders should be placed. mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36) to reflect this low-demand regime (avg ~42 units), which will naturally result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand inventory, effectively stopping all ordering.

Carry-over insight: November demand floor confirmed: P32-P36 average demand is 45.8 units, maintaining the off-season baseline for swimwear.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (women's swimwear bottoms) is in its deep off-season floor as of mid-November. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, with the average demand for the last 8 periods (P30-P37) being approximately 41 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is exceptionally high (2096 units) relative to this demand regime. At the current consumption rate of ~40 units/period, there is over 50 periods of supply, which is more than enough to cover the remaining 7 periods of the simulation. No further orders are required. The OR parameters will be set to reflect this stable, low-demand off-season regime using the most recent 8 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: November demand floor confirmed: average demand for P30-P37 is 41 units, maintaining the off-season baseline. On-hand inventory is sufficient for the remainder of the year.

The product is in its deep off-season (November), with demand consistently below 50 units for several weeks (P32-P38 average ~39 units). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 2,054 units, which is enough to cover more than 50 periods of the current demand regime. No further orders are necessary as the game concludes in 6 periods (Period 45). I will maintain 'recent_8' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized off-season floor (approx 41 units/period), allowing the OR engine to correctly calculate a low base stock and place zero orders.

The simulation is currently in Period 40 (late November). The product (women's swimwear bottoms) is in its deep off-season floor. Demand since Period 30 has consistently averaged around 40 units per period, with Period 39 recording just 17 units. On-hand inventory is 2,037 units, which is approximately 50 times the current average demand and far exceeds the needs for the remaining 5 periods of the simulation. No further orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (mu_hat based on the last 10 periods of off-season data) to ensure the backend logic does not trigger unnecessary orders, although the high inventory levels already naturally prevent ordering.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in Period 41 (early December). The product is a swimwear bottom, which is in its deep off-season. Current demand remains very low, averaging approximately 51 units over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), despite a minor spike to 113 units in Period 40. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,924 units, which is more than enough to cover any conceivable demand for the remaining 4 periods of the simulation (ending Period 45). Since the holding cost is $1.0/unit and profit is $4.0/unit, the priority is to avoid any further ordering and allow the on-hand inventory to satisfy demand. I will set the lead time to the default of 4 and use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the low off-season demand regime, which will result in a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing any new orders.

Carry-over insight: December off-season demand remains low (P31-P40 average ~51 units), confirming the established seasonal floor.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is currently in Period 42 (December 9th). The product is a swimwear bottom, which is in its deep off-season. Demand has stabilized at a low floor, with the last 10 periods (P32-P41) averaging approximately 51.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,873 units, with zero units in transit. Given that lead time is 4 periods and only 3 periods remain in the simulation (P43, P44, P45), any orders placed now will not arrive before the simulation ends. Furthermore, the existing on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (approx. 150 units total vs 1,873 available). To maximize profit and minimize holding costs, no further orders are required. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current off-season demand regime, while keeping L at default (4) to maintain the standard logic, knowing the OR backend will cap orders at zero due to the massive inventory surplus.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 of 45, deep in the off-season for swimwear (December). Demand has stabilized at a low floor, with the recent 5-period average (P38-P42) being 56 units. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (bikini bottom), which follows a clear seasonal pattern that collapsed in late August and has remained at baseline levels since September. Current on-hand inventory is 1816 units, which is approximately 32 times a single period's current average demand. Given the simulation ends in Period 45, no additional inventory is needed to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) and provide no additional profit, as the service level is already 100% with existing stock. I will continue to set parameters that result in zero orders by keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with the low off-season demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a deep off-season period (December). Inventory levels are extremely high (1758 units), following the significant overstocking that occurred due to the collapse of the high-summer demand peak in August. Current weekly demand is averaging approximately 53 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), while the most recent 3-period average is 55.3. Given the current on-hand inventory, we have over 30 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to reflect the stable off-season regime for both demand mean and volatility, while sticking to the promised lead time of 4 periods which has been consistently observed throughout the simulation.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear Midrise Brief) is currently in the late-December off-season. Analysis of recent demand (P40-P44) shows a stabilized floor with an average of approximately 67 units (inclusive of a slight mid-November outlier). Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 1,701 units, which is extremely high (covering over 25 periods of current demand). Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit) relative to profit ($4.00/unit), the priority remains to liquidate existing stock rather than placing new orders. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=5) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders while inventory levels normalize.
