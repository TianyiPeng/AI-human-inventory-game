Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019/02/25) for a Women's Swimwear SKU. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], likely reflecting the start of the spring/summer seasonal ramp-up. The average demand is 130.6, but the most recent observation (213) is significantly higher. Given the product category and the date (late February), I expect demand to continue increasing as customers prepare for beach season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-growth phase (averaging ~164.7 per period) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since it is Period 1, there are no 'conclude' messages to infer actual lead time, so I will stick to the promised lead time of 2 periods using the 'default' method. This setup allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1) while acknowledging the rising volatility.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/3/4). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Historical demand for the last 6 periods is [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175]. There is a clear upward trend in demand as we approach the spring/summer swimwear season. In Period 1, we ordered 237 units with a promised lead time of 2. Following the lead time definition, this order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 4's start. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 237 units in transit. Given the seasonality of swimwear in March, demand is expected to remain high or continue to grow. The average demand of the last 3 samples is approximately 172. To ensure we cover the (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (Periods 2, 3, and 4) while accounting for the recent upward trend and seasonal nature, I will use a recent_N method for demand estimation. Using N=3 captures the most recent high-demand regime (213, 175, plus the previous 129).

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (March 11, 2019). The product is a women's swim brief, which is entering its seasonal ramp-up period in the Northern Hemisphere. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trend: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173]. The last two periods (P1 and P2) showed consistent demand around 173-175, suggesting a new baseline significantly higher than the initial historical mean. Lead time: The P1 order arrived in P2 (L=1), which is shorter than the promised L=2. I will set L to 1 to reflect this observed efficiency and avoid over-ordering in the pipeline. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~187) while discarding the much lower early history. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 3 samples to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~130 to ~175 starting Period 1. Actual lead time observed as 1 period (P1 order arrived P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Demand history shows a clear regime shift from early training samples (avg ~130) to the current live period demand (P1: 175, P2: 173, P3: 181), averaging 176.3. I am currently out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) due to high demand exceeding initial stock in Period 3. Lead time observation: The Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (Actual L=1), which is shorter than the promised L=2. However, the Period 2 order (242 units) did not arrive in Period 3, suggesting L=2 for that shipment. To be safe, I will use L=2 (promised) to ensure sufficient pipeline coverage. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current demand level of ~176.3/period. Since L=2, mu_hat should reflect (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. There is a total of 337 units in transit (P2 order: 242, P3 order: 95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~130 to 176.3 (+35%) across Periods 1-3. Lead time variability observed: P1 order was L=1, but P2 order is L>=2.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context is late March (Spring/Swimwear season), showing a clear upward trend from initial estimates. Historical demand for the last 5 periods [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] and recent concluded observations [175, 173, 181, 200] indicate a demand regime well above the initial levels, averaging ~182 units per period. Regarding lead time: P1 arrived in 1 period (L=1), but orders from P2, P3, and P4 (totaling 521 units) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the P2 order should have arrived in P4; its absence suggests actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there are delays. We have 0 on-hand and 521 in-transit. I will use L=3 to account for the observed delay and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current high-demand Spring season. Set N=4 to cover the most recent high-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~182 (+82%) over the last 4 periods (P1-P4). Lead time delay observed: P2 order (placed Period 2) did not arrive by Period 4, indicating actual lead time L >= 3.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a Women's Swimwear SKU as we approach April, a period where seasonal demand typically ramps up. The demand history [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] from the prompt header seems inconsistent with the game history provided (175, 173, 181, 200, 268), which shows a clear upward trend. In Period 5, demand spiked to 268, and we sold all 242 units that arrived from the Period 2 order, leaving us with 0 on-hand. Lead times are highly volatile: P1 arrived in 1 period, but P2 took 3 periods. The orders from P3 (95), P4 (184), and P5 (203) are still in transit (total 482). Given the seasonality and the last 5 periods' mean demand of ~200, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay, mu_hat to an explicit value of 880 (estimating 220 demand per period for L+1=4 periods), and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased significantly to ~200 over the last 5 periods (P1-P5). Lead time is volatile/extended: Observed L=1 (P1) and L=3 (P2).

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '599580017' (Womens Swimwear) is experiencing a sharp seasonal upward trend as we move into April, which aligns with the build-up to the summer season. Historical demands in the last three periods were 200, 268, and 376, indicating an accelerating demand regime. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~281. Lead times have been volatile, with observations of 1, 3, 3, and 2 periods (average 2.25). We are currently stocked out (on-hand 0) and have 489 units in-transit (from P5 and P6). Given the rapid demand growth and the transition into peak swimwear season, I am setting L to 3 (to account for recent delays and build safety stock) and mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, while adjusting sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (explicitly set to 100 to increase the base stock level and avoid persistent stockouts).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Demand increased from ~175 (P1-P3) to ~281 (P4-P6) as swimwear season approaches. Lead time variability stabilized at an average of ~2.25 periods (observed 1, 3, 3, 2).

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is entering its peak season in mid-April. Demand has transitioned from ~175 (P1-P3) to ~313 (P5-P7), representing a clear upward trend. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 853 units in transit (orders from P5, P6, P7). Historically, lead times have been volatile (1, 3, 3, 2), averaging 2.25 periods. Given the promised lead time is 2, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 periods (P5-P7) show a mean of 313, which is a better anchor for the current seasonal acceleration than the full history. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volume and increased volatility (std \u2248 55) as we approach the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak accelerating: mean demand increased to ~313 (P5-P7) from ~213 (P1-P4) (+47%). High stockout risk due to lead time variability and surging demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently in late April (2019/4/22), entering the peak demand season. Demand has surged significantly, with the last three periods showing [376, 295, 367], averaging ~346 units/period. Previous periods (P1-P3) averaged ~176. This is a confirmed seasonal regime shift (+96% increase). Current inventory is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have 853 units in-transit. Based on the 'conclude' messages, observed lead times are [1, 3, 3, 2], averaging 2.25 periods. Specifically, orders from P5 (203 units), P6 (286 units), and P7 (364 units) are still in-transit. P5 is now at L=4 (overdue), while P6 and P7 are within reasonable arrival windows. Since we have a massive pipeline (853 units) and the backend caps orders based on expected demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the seasonal peak (avg 346) across the lead time (L=2) plus review period, which equals (1+2)*346 = 1038. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock high enough to cover the seasonal peak once the pipeline arrives, while the 'cap' mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering if the pipeline is just delayed.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed for Swimwear category: Mean demand stabilized at ~346 units (Periods 6-8) vs ~176 units (Periods 1-3). Lead time is volatile with a mean of 2.25 periods; shipments from Period 5 (203 units) are now overdue (L=4).

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently in late April (2019/04/29), approaching the peak summer season. Demand has been surging significantly: the last 4 observed demands are [268, 376, 295, 367, 477], averaging ~357 units per period. This represents a major shift from the initial regime (Periods 1-3) of ~176. Lead times remain volatile and extended: observed lead times are [1, 3, 3, 2, 3], with the Period 5 order (203 units) now 5 periods overdue (L=5) and likely lost or severely delayed. The Period 7 order (364 units) is also overdue (L=3). Inventory is currently 0, with 839 units in transit (including likely lost P5 units). To protect against the peak season surge and the unreliability of the supply chain, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand regime (~357/period) and setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the demand across (L+1)=4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for Swimwear accelerated: Mean demand increased from ~313 (P5-P7) to ~380 (P6-P9) (+21%). Significant supply chain disruption: Period 5 order (203 units) confirmed as a lost shipment (L=5+ and no arrival). Actual lead time average for successful shipments is 2.4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (May 6th), entering the peak season for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). Demand has surged from ~175 in early March to an average of ~437 over the last three periods (P8-P10). In-transit inventory is 977 units, but this includes a 203-unit shipment from Period 5 which is now 6 periods late and confirmed lost. Excluding that loss, effective pipeline is 774 units (P9: 272, P10: 502). Historical lead times (1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3) average 2.5 periods, with recent shipments consistently taking 3 periods. I am setting L=3 to account for this reality. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 3 periods to capture the current seasonal peak (~437/period), adjusted for (1+L). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility during the seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak for Swimwear SKU 599580017 is fully active: Mean demand increased from ~313 (P5-P7) to ~437 (P8-P10) (+40%). Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last two observed arrivals (P6 and P7 orders).

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (May 13), entering the peak of the swimwear season. Historical demand for SKU 599580017 has escalated significantly, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging ~387 units and the last 3 periods (P9-P11) averaging ~425 units. The Period 11 demand (332) was a slight dip but likely due to inventory constraints rather than a trend reversal. Lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (P9 order arrived in 2 periods, P6/P7 orders in 3 periods). The P5 order is officially confirmed as a lost shipment (L=6+). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 1,268 units in transit (orders from P10 and P11). Given the seasonality and high stockout risk (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 implies a high service level), I will set L to 3 (recent observed max) and use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current seasonal regime without over-indexing on the single high P9 demand or the lower P11 demand.

Carry-over insight: P5 order (203 units) confirmed lost at Period 12 (L=7+). Lead time for active shipments stabilized between 2-3 periods. Seasonal demand regime for May/June established at ~385+ units/period.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is late May (2019/05/20), representing the peak seasonal demand for women's swimwear. Recent demand history shows a sustained regime shift: the average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 423.5, compared to the early-season average. The order from Period 5 (203 units) is confirmed lost (L=7+), yet it still appears in the system's 'In-transit' count (1689 total = P5: 203 + P10: 502 + P11: 563 + P12: 421). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit pipeline from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 203 phantom units that will never arrive. I am setting L=3 to reflect the consistent recent delays (avg lead time ~2.4) and mu_hat = (1+L) * 474.25 (derived from the current mean 423.5 plus a 50.75 adjustment to recover the 203 lost units over the L+1 window) to prevent under-ordering during the peak. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to ensure high service levels during this stockout-prone period.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' count incorrectly includes 203 units from lost Period 5 order; mu_hat must be manually inflated to compensate for the pipeline deficit until the system clears. Current demand regime for May/June peak stabilized at ~425 units/period.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May, the peak demand season for Swimwear. Current demand has stabilized at a high regime (approx. 380-440 units/period). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows 2003 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'in-transit' count includes 203 units from Period 5 that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory (including the lost units) from the calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target level and compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. Observed lead times have recently stabilized around 2-3 periods (P9 arrived in 2, P6/P7 in 3). I will set L to 3 to be safe against stockouts during this peak season. Given the average demand of ~425 units and a (L+1) horizon, a base_stock target should be around 1700. Adding the 203 unit deficit, I set mu_hat to 1903. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the lost units as non-existent.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3, 2019, representing the peak of the swimwear season. Recent demand has stabilized around a higher mean of ~425 units (Periods 11-14 avg: 411, excluding the Period 14 spike to 525). The Period 5 order (203 units) is officially lost, but still incorrectly counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline by the OR backend. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory' and prevent under-ordering during the peak season, I am manually inflating mu_hat. Specifically, the required base stock must cover (L+1) periods. With an actual L of 3, we need to cover 4 periods of demand. Base stock target \u2248 4 * 425 = 1700. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (1131, which includes the 203 lost units), I will set mu_hat to ensure the order covers the gap. I'm using recent_N (N=4) to capture the peak season mean (~411) and sigma (~82). By setting L to 3 (recent average), the backend calculates base stock for (3+1) periods. No further mu_hat inflation is needed this period as on-hand is healthy (352) and a large arrival (563+314) occurred in Period 14.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019, representing the peak swimwear season for SKU 599580017. Recent demand (P14-P15) shows a high mean of 427.5 units. The inventory position is critical: on-hand is low at 22 units, and the pipeline is heavily inflated by 1433 units. However, this in-transit figure includes the 203 units from the lost Period 5 shipment and a large block of 502 units from Period 10 (now L=5, highly likely lost or severely delayed). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the 425+ unit/period demand regime despite the system's overestimation of 'In-transit' stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1700. This represents (L+1) * 425, where L=3 (the stable actual lead time observed recently). Using an explicit mu_hat bridges the gap between the backend's pipeline calculation and actual usable inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high stockout risks observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 10 order (502 units) is now L=5 with no arrival, joining the Period 5 lost shipment (203 units). Total phantom pipeline inventory in system: 705 units. Demand remains stable in the high-summer regime at ~425 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand for this swimwear SKU remains in a high-summer regime, though recent periods show slight cooling (avg ~385). There is a significant discrepancy in the 'In-transit' count (1847 units) due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 5 (203 units) and Period 10 (502 units), totaling 705 'phantom' units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the actual gap, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1 review period) at a demand of 385/period, which is 1155 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the 705 units of phantom inventory, I inflate mu_hat by that amount: (1155 target base stock + 705 phantom units) / (1 + L) = 1860 / 3 = 620. I set L=2 as recent successful arrivals (P11, P13) suggest the supply chain has stabilized near the promised lead time, despite the losses. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent volatility (P14-P16).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost shipments: 705 units (P5: 203, P10: 502). Effective demand regime for June stabilized at ~385 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24, the peak of the women's swimwear season. The demand regime for June is established at an average of ~385 units/period (P14-P17 mean: 418, P15-P17 mean: 383). Inventory management is severely complicated by 'phantom pipeline' inventory. As noted in carry-over insights, the Period 5 order (203 units) and the Period 10 order (502 units) are confirmed lost (L=12 and L=7 respectively), yet they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total: 705 units). To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to offset this 705-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=3) = (L+1) * Expected Demand = 4 * 385 = 1540. System Calculation = Target Base Stock - (Total In-transit - Lost Units). To force the backend to ignore the 705 lost units, I provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. Effective mu_hat = (4 * 385) + 705 = 2245. This ensures the order calculation (Base Stock - 1972) reflects actual needs. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on recent successful deliveries (P11, P14).

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (July 1st), the demand for this swimwear SKU is in a peak seasonal phase, evidenced by the demand spike to 771 units in Period 18. Historically, the mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 489 units. However, there is a significant discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure of 2121 units. Based on history, the Period 5 (203 units) and Period 10 (502 units) orders are confirmed lost, totaling 705 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline. Additionally, the Period 12 (421 units) order is now L=6, suggesting it is also likely lost. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this non-existent 1126+ units of pipeline, I must artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat). Setting L=3 reflects the consistent upper bound of actual lead times. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating it as (1+L) * 500 (forecasted mean) + 1126 (lost pipeline) = 3126. Sigma is set high to capture the volatility seen in the 771 demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline discrepancy increased: Period 12 order (421 units) is now L=6 and likely lost, joining P5 (203) and P10 (502). Total phantom pipeline inventory: 1126 units. Demand regime peak confirmed: Period 18 demand spike of 771 units confirms high-summer volatility.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (July 8), the peak of the swimwear season. Demand in the last two periods (771 and 592) indicates high summer volatility and a sustained high-demand regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 502 units. The 'In-transit' count of 3273 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' from lost or severely delayed shipments: Period 5 (203), Period 10 (502), and Period 12 (421), totaling 1126 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2200. This is calculated as: ((1 + L) * average_demand) + phantom_inventory, where L=3, average_demand=500. This results in (4 * 500) + 1126 = 3126. However, since the system applies a cap based on mu_hat, I am providing a high explicit mu_hat to ensure the order covers the immediate gap while the pipeline remains unreliable. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect high summer variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline discrepancy increased: Period 12 order (421 units) is now L=8 and likely lost, joining P5 (203) and P10 (502). Total phantom pipeline inventory in system: 1126 units. High-summer demand regime (July) is volatile, with mean demand near 500 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the high-summer swimwear season (July 15). Demand over the last five periods (P16-P20) has averaged 544.8 units/period, showing significant volatility with a peak of 771 units. The system reports 3,337 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms three significant lost shipments (P5: 203, P10: 502, P12: 421), totaling 1,126 units of 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The actual active pipeline is 2,211 units (orders from P16-P20). To compensate for the 1,126-unit deficit and prevent stockouts during this peak demand phase, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 2,800 units. This value is derived from the expected demand over (L+1) periods (approx. 550 * 3 = 1,650) plus the 1,126 units of phantom inventory the OR engine incorrectly thinks we have. Setting L=2 (promised) while using this inflated mu_hat ensures the base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) triggers an order that covers the true physical requirement. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 1126 units (P5: 203, P10: 502, P12: 421). July demand regime is peak summer: average demand ~545 units/period with high volatility (max 771).

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for swimwear (late July). The most recent demand (P18-P21) averages approximately 604 units per period (771, 592, 542, 510). Lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (P19 arrived in 2 periods). The critical issue is the presence of 1126 units of phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' count (P5: 203, P10: 502, P12: 421) which the OR engine will subtract from our base stock, leading to massive under-ordering. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual needs, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (L=2, so 3 periods) based on a demand of 604/period plus a significant buffer to account for the 1126 phantom units. Target Base Stock = (3 * 604) + 1126 = 2938. By setting mu_hat to 2938 / (1+L), the OR engine will calculate a base stock that, after subtracting the phantom 1126 and real in-transit units, maintains high availability during the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory from lost shipments (P5: 203, P10: 502, P12: 421) remains in the system 'In-transit' count, totaling 1126 units. Peak summer demand (July) remains high, averaging ~600 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is the peak of the swimwear season. Recent demand in July has been very high and volatile, with a mean demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) of approximately 625 units (771, 592, 542, 510, 710). We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 2390 units is heavily inflated by several confirmed or highly probable lost shipments: P5 (203), P10 (502), and P12 (421), totaling 1126 'phantom' units. Additionally, the P16 (414), P17 (130), and P18 (451) orders are now past the typical 3-period lead time, suggesting further pipeline disruption. To force the OR backend to order despite this high phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method. I am setting mu_hat to 3500, which covers (L+1) periods of the 625-unit demand regime (approx 1875 units) PLUS the 1126 phantom units, ensuring the system calculates a deficit and places a substantial order to replenish stock for the remaining high-demand weeks. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised) to keep the backend's calculation windows tight, while sigma_hat is set to 250 (explicit) to account for the high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime peak confirmed: average demand ~625 units/period (P18-P22). Phantom pipeline inventory from lost/severely delayed shipments (P5, P10, P12, and potentially P16-P18) has reached critical levels, necessitating manual mu_hat inflation to bypass the 'In-transit' logic.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5, representing the late-summer transition for swimwear. Demand remains volatile but shows signs of tapering (Period 23 demand was 309 vs. July average of ~600). A critical supply chain issue persists: total 'In-transit' inventory of 3442 units contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Orders from Period 5 (203), Period 10 (502), Period 12 (421), Period 16 (414), Period 17 (130), and Period 18 (451) are highly likely lost (L=5 to L=18), totaling 2121 phantom units. The only reliable pipeline inventory is the Period 23 order (1321 units). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 3442 units as available and placing zero orders, I am inflating mu_hat. I target an effective base stock of ~3500 (calculated as ~1400 real safety stock + 2121 phantom units) to ensure the system places a supplemental order to bridge the gap until the large Period 23 shipment arrives. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P19, P20, P22) arrived in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory from lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18) now totals 2121 units. Transition from peak July demand (~600) to late-summer August demand (~450-500) is underway.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/12. We are exiting the peak summer demand regime for Swimwear (SKU 599580017). Historically, demand peaked in July (averaging ~600) and is now cooling down, as seen in the last two periods (309 and 176). The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Lost orders from Periods 5 (203), 10 (502), 12 (421), 16 (414), 17 (130), and 18 (451) total 2121 units that are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. With a total 'In-transit' of 3753 units, the backend will likely place zero orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to bypass this logic. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the expected August demand (~400 units/period) plus the 2121 phantom units to ensure the backend actually orders sufficient stock for the remaining 3 periods of lead time/review. For L, although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have been volatile (1-3 periods); I will use explicit L=2 to reflect recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline confirmed: Demand dropped from July peak (~600) to August transition (~240 avg last 2 periods). Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18) remains at 2121 units, blocking the automated replenishment logic.

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. We are in the post-peak seasonal decline phase for Women's Swimwear. Demand has dropped from a July peak of ~600 units to a mean of 154 units over the last two periods (P24-P25). There is a massive pipeline inventory discrepancy: 'In-transit' shows 3442 units, but history suggests that Period 5 (203), Period 10 (502), Period 12 (421), Period 16 (414), Period 17 (130), Period 18 (451), and Period 23 (1321) orders are likely lost or severely delayed (totaling 3442 units). Because 'In-transit' inventory is subtracted from the 'base_stock' to determine the order quantity, this 'phantom' inventory prevents the system from placing new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the desired stock level. I am forecasting demand at ~150 units/period for the late-August regime. With L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods (~450 units). To trigger an order despite 3442 phantom units, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 3900, which should yield a net order to maintain service levels during the decline.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline confirmed for SKU 599580017: mean demand dropped from ~600 (July) to ~150 (August). Total phantom pipeline inventory from lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18, P23) has reached 3442 units, requiring manual mu_hat inflation to force replenishment.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a clear post-peak seasonal decline for late August. Demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) has averaged ~154 units (176, 132, 155), a significant drop from the July peak of ~600. Current on-hand inventory is 1345 units, which covers approximately 8-9 periods of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 2688 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18) which total 2121 units. The real pipeline consists only of the P26 order (567 units). Since current on-hand (1345) + real pipeline (567) = 1912 units, and demand is trending around 150-200 units, we are overstocked. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new lower demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on the most recent completed delivery (P23 order), which aligns with the historical average during the season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Average demand dropped to ~155 units/period starting Period 24. Total phantom pipeline inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18) remains at 2121 units.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has exited its peak summer demand regime. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower 'post-peak' level, averaging ~150 units per period over the last four weeks (P24-P27: 176, 132, 155, 139). On-hand inventory is currently high (1206 units) due to the delayed arrival of the large Period 23 order (1321 units) during Period 26. The system 'In-transit' count of 2688 is heavily inflated by several confirmed lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18) which total 2121 units of phantom inventory. Because on-hand inventory (1206) already covers approximately 8 periods of current demand (~150/period), and the OR backend's base-stock logic will subtract the massive 'In-transit' figure from any target, no new orders are desired. I am setting mu_hat to a low 'recent_N' value (N=4) to reflect the new demand regime and allowing the high on-hand stock to deplete naturally, avoiding further holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly entered its post-peak seasonal decline as of September. Demand has dropped from a July peak of ~600 units/period to an average of ~117 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), with the most recent observation at 78 units. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (1695 units) due to the arrival of large late-season orders (P23 and P26). At the current demand rate of ~100 units/period, the current stock provides roughly 17 periods of coverage, which is far in excess of the lead time. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 2121 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18), as documented in carry-over insights. Since on-hand inventory alone is sufficient to meet demand for the foreseeable future, and we must avoid incurring excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime. The backend logic will naturally stop ordering because (on-hand + pipeline) >> base_stock. No manual inflation is needed now that actual stock has arrived.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime for September confirmed: Demand declined from ~600 (July) to ~117 (last 5 periods). Current on-hand inventory (1695) provides excessive coverage; replenishment should be paused.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly entered a post-peak seasonal decline as of mid-September. Demand over the last five periods has dropped significantly (176, 132, 155, 139, 78, 65), with the most recent two periods averaging only 71.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 1630 units, which provides over 20 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Furthermore, the system tracks 2121 units of 'In-transit' inventory which are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 18. This 'phantom' pipeline inventory would normally block automated orders, but given the massive overstock on-hand (1630 units) relative to the low end-of-season demand, no new orders should be placed regardless of the pipeline discrepancy. I am setting parameters to reflect the new low-demand regime and ensure no further capital is tied up in holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime for September/October confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~70 units/period (last 2 periods) from the ~150 units seen in August. Significant overstock exists.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Swimwear) has entered a clear post-peak seasonal decline. Demand in Period 30 dropped to 30 units, continuing the downward trend observed throughout September (139 -> 78 -> 65 -> 30). On-hand inventory is currently 1600 units, which, at the current demand rate, provides over 30 periods of coverage. Additionally, the system still reports 2,121 units of 'In-transit' inventory which consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18). With a holding cost of $1.00 per unit and a profit of $4.00, the priority is to avoid any further replenishment and liquidate the existing overstock. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this rapid seasonal decline, which will result in a low base stock level far below the current on-hand and phantom pipeline inventory, effectively pausing all orders.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed: September demand averaged ~78 units/period, a significant drop from the August transition (~150). Liquidation phase active.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the post-peak seasonal decline phase for this swimwear SKU (Date: 2019/9/30). Demand has dropped significantly from the July peak of ~600 units/period to a late-September average of ~33 units/period (last two periods: 30, 35). Current on-hand inventory is 1565 units, which covers nearly 47 periods of demand at the current rate. There is also a substantial 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 2121 units from lost shipments (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18) that the OR backend still considers active. Given the massive overstock relative to the end-of-season demand, no further orders should be placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the current low-demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation stays far below current on-hand levels to suppress replenishment and minimize holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has entered a definitive end-of-season demand collapse. Current demand for the last four periods has averaged approximately 48 units/period (30, 35, 62, and the preceding 65), which is a significant drop from the summer peak (~600) and the August transition (~150). The current on-hand inventory is 1,503 units, which provides over 30 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' count of 2,121 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18), as previously confirmed in carry-over insights. Given the massive overstock relative to the current demand regime, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the low-demand autumn regime, allowing the OR backend to calculate a low base-stock. No manual inflation is needed as the goal is to liquidate the existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse confirmed: Oct demand regime stabilized at ~48 units/period (last 4 periods). Liquidating 1503 on-hand units; no further ordering required for the remainder of the season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1313.00

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in the late-season/liquidation phase (mid-October). Historical demand has plummeted from a July peak of ~600 units/period to a recent October average of ~44 units/period (last 4 periods: 30, 35, 62, 38). On-hand inventory is extremely high at 1465 units, which covers approximately 33 periods of current demand\u2014far exceeding the remaining 11 periods of the simulation. Additionally, the system reports 2121 units 'In-transit', which are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 18. Given the massive overstock and the end-of-season demand collapse, no further orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand and prevent any automated replenishment triggered by the phantom pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1250.00

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 35 (late October), and the demand for this swimwear SKU has collapsed as expected for the end of the season, stabilizing at an average of approximately 42 units per period over the last five observations. With 1,422 units currently on hand and only 10 periods remaining in the simulation, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all projected demand (estimated at ~450 units total) through the end of the game. Furthermore, the system tracks 2,121 units of 'In-transit' inventory which are confirmed phantom units from lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18). Because the 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) is extremely high (~3,543 units) relative to the base stock required for a 40-unit demand regime, the OR engine will naturally suppress all new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to accurately reflect this end-of-season demand level and minimize any risk of the system triggering unnecessary replenishment, though the existing overstock makes further ordering impossible anyway.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's swimwear bottom, which is a highly seasonal SKU. We are currently in late October (Period 36), well past the peak summer demand regime observed in July. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower 'end-of-season' level, averaging approximately 44 units per period over the last five periods (P31-P35). The current on-hand inventory is 1372 units, which, at the current demand rate, provides approximately 31 periods of coverage. There is a persistent phantom pipeline inventory of 2121 units from historical lost shipments (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18) that remains in the system count. Given the massive overstock relative to current demand and the fact that we are approaching the end of the 45-period horizon, no further orders are required. The strategy remains focused on liquidation to minimize holding costs while satisfying the residual demand.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is in a deep post-peak/end-of-season phase. Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging ~44 units per period over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). The inventory on-hand is currently 1,336 units, which at the current demand rate, covers over 30 periods of demand. Given we are at Period 37 of 45, the remaining 8 periods of demand will likely not exceed 400-500 units even with minor volatility. Therefore, no additional orders are required. The OR backend's 'In-transit' count is still inflated by 2,121 units of phantom inventory from lost historical shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18), but this is irrelevant as the current on-hand stock is already far above any reasonable base stock level. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low end-of-season demand and ensure the backend does not place unnecessary orders.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has entered its off-season demand regime, which is consistently low. Currently, we are in Period 38 (November), and demand has stabilized at approximately 40 units per period (average of the last 5 periods is 39.2). On-hand inventory is 1,302 units, while 'In-transit' reflects 2,121 phantom units from lost historical shipments. With an average demand of ~40 units and 1,302 units on hand, we have over 30 periods of stock available, which far exceeds the remaining 7 periods of the simulation. My objective is to prevent any further ordering to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock. I will use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat to 0 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) does not trigger an order despite the phantom 'In-transit' units, effectively pausing all replenishment for the rest of the game.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a deep end-of-season/off-season phase (November) for swimwear. Historical demand has stabilized at a very low regime, averaging approximately 41 units per period over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The current on-hand inventory of 1260 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game (up to Period 45) at this demand rate without any further ordering. Additionally, there is 2121 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost shipments earlier in the season (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18). To prevent the OR backend from triggering any unnecessary orders due to the low service level caused by these lost shipments, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime and keeping L at default. The objective is to liquidate the existing on-hand stock and minimize holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Swimwear) is in a deep off-season demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 37 units per period over the last 5 periods (P35-P39). The current date is late November (2019/11/25), confirming the winter low-point for this category. The system reports an on-hand inventory of 1,243 units and a phantom in-transit pipeline of 2,121 units (from confirmed lost shipments P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18). Given that the current on-hand inventory (1,243) provides over 30 periods of coverage at the current demand rate, and only 5 periods remain in the simulation, no further orders are required. The strategy remains liquidation of existing stock to minimize further holding costs. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend does not trigger a replenishment order despite the phantom pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). Current period is early December (Period 41), which is the off-season for swimwear in this market. Recent demand has been very low, averaging ~47 units/period over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), with a minor pre-holiday bump to 113 in Period 40. On-hand inventory is 1130 units, which covers approximately 24 periods of current demand. There is also a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 2121 units from historical lost shipments (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18) that never arrived. Given the massive overstock and the off-season status, the objective is to liquidate existing inventory and avoid any new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime to reflect the low off-season demand, which will naturally result in zero new orders due to the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand regime confirmed: Sept-Nov demand averaged ~47 units/period. Significant overstock (1130 units) exists, covering >20 periods of current demand.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 42 (December 9th). The product is a Swimwear SKU, which is currently in its off-season demand phase. Historical data shows that demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (~600 units) to an off-season average of approximately 47 units per period (based on the last 10+ periods). Current on-hand inventory is 1079 units. Given the low demand regime, this inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 23 periods of sales, which far exceeds the remaining 4 periods of the game (total 45 periods). There is also a substantial 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 2121 units (from confirmed lost shipments in periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 18) which the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming stock. However, since the on-hand stock is already more than enough to meet all remaining demand, no further orders are required. To prevent the system from ordering more, I will maintain lead time and demand parameters that reflect the current low-demand environment, allowing the existing inventory to gradually deplete and minimize further holding costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 43). This SKU (Swimwear) is in its deep off-season. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged approximately 54 units per period (42, 17, 113, 51, 57), showing low off-season levels with occasional small fluctuations (likely late-season clearance or travel-related purchases). Current on-hand inventory is 1022 units, which provides approximately 19 periods of coverage at current demand rates. There is a persistent 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 2121 units due to confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18). Given that the game ends in Period 45, the primary objective is to minimize further holding costs by not placing any new orders. The existing stock is more than sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand for the final 3 periods. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are triggered by the OR backend.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in its deep off-season. Demand over the last five periods (P39-P43) has averaged approximately 59 units/period, despite a small Black Friday/Cyber Monday blip in P40. On-hand inventory is currently 964 units, which at the current demand rate covers more than 16 periods (well into the next spring season). There is also significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory (2121 units) resulting from lost shipments earlier in the year (P5, P10, P12, P16, P17, P18). Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) and sufficient stock to cover the entire winter, no new orders should be placed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (last 10 periods) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains below the current on-hand plus pipeline levels, effectively suppressing new orders while we liquidate existing stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The product is a Swimwear SKU (Timeless Midrise Brief) currently in its deep off-season. Demand has stabilized at a low off-season regime, with the last 4 periods averaging ~56 units per period. On-hand inventory is 907 units, which covers approximately 16 periods of current demand. There is also a significant amount of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (2121 units) from lost shipments earlier in the year (Periods 5, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18), which the backend system still considers active. Given the massive overstock relative to the current demand rate and the off-season timing, no further orders should be placed. Parameters are set to 'default' or 'recent_N' to reflect the current low-demand environment, knowing that the on-hand inventory already far exceeds any reasonable base stock level calculated by the OR engine.
