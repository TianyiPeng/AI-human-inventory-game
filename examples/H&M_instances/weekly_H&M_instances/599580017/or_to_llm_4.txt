Historical demand samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] show a clear upward trend, likely due to the start of the spring swimwear season (late February date). The empirical mean is ~130, but the most recent data point (213) suggests a regime shift or strong seasonal ramp-up. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for demand within this same period. The OR recommendation is 179 units based on historical averages and standard deviations. However, given the current date (Feb 25) and the product type (swimwear), I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory past the historical average.

The product is Women's Swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief), and the date is mid-March. This signals the start of the spring/summer swim season, explaining the shift to a higher demand regime (approx 175 units/period).\n3. Inventory & OR Analysis: Starting OH is 27. The OR algorithm recommends 160 units based on a capped base-stock policy. Given the current demand stability around 175 and the 0-period lead time, we need to ensure OH + Order covers the immediate period's demand (which occurs after the decision).\n4.

This OR recommendation is heavily flawed because it is based on the average of all historical samples (including the low-demand February/March samples) and is aggressively capped at roughly 320 units.

Over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand has averaged 418.5 units with high volatility (302 to 525). \n4. **CRITICAL FRACTILE & OR RECOMMENDATION**: Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0.

Analysis of the demand history and carry-over insights confirms that the seasonal peak in July (avg demand ~600-700) has ended. Since the start of August (Period 24), demand has dropped significantly and stabilized at a much lower level: Period 24 (176), Period 25 (132), and Period 26 (155). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 154 units. Currently, there are 128 units on-hand. The OR recommendation of 360 units is based on high historical averages that include the summer peak, which is no longer relevant as we move into late August. Ordering 360 units would likely lead to excessive holding costs as the season concludes. Given the 0-period lead time, I will order 122 units to bring the total available inventory (on-hand + new order) to 250 units.
