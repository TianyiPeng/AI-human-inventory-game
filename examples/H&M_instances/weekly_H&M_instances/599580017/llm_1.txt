The most recent sample (213) suggests high momentum. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0. This means orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current inventory is 0. e) Order Logic: Since L=0, I need enough stock to cover Period 1's demand. Based on the upward trend and the seasonal timing (leading into Spring), I will target the higher end of the historical range.

Actual demand in P1 and P2 was 175 and 173, respectively, significantly higher than the prior samples, suggesting a strong seasonal or baseline shift. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Concluded data for P1 and P2 confirms a lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). No orders are missing. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 47. In-transit is 0. Projected demand for P3, given the consistency of the last two periods and the seasonal context, is estimated at ~180. e) Final Order Logic: To cover P3 demand (~180 units) starting from 47 on-hand, I need roughly 133 units. Adding a safety buffer for the upward seasonal trend and the higher-than-expected P1/P2 baseline, I will order 173 units to target an ending inventory of approximately 40 units (similar to P1/P2 levels) to balance service level and holding costs ($1.0/unit).",

This indicates a strong upward trajectory and significant unmet demand. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid a third consecutive stockout during this peak period, I need to order significantly more than the previous demand of 376.
