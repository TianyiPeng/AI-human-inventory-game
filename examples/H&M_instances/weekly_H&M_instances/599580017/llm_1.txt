This is the start of the spring break/vacation season and lead-up to summer, where swimwear demand typically rises. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical samples show [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], averaging ~130 units with a clear upward trend (regime shifting upwards). c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 will arrive at the start of P4. I need to cover demand for P1, P2, and P3. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Final Order Logic: To avoid stockouts while arrivals are pending, I need to cover the lead time (2) plus the current period (1). Total periods to cover = 3. Using the recent sample average of ~130, I expect roughly 390 units of demand before the first order arrives. Given the upward trend and upcoming spring season, I will aim for a slightly higher safety stock. I'll order 450 units to establish an initial pipeline.",

This is significantly higher than the initial historical average, confirming the seasonal uptick for women's swimwear as we enter March. (c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 2 periods.

(d) Inventory & Pipeline: I currently have 0 on-hand and 450 in-transit. Because I have 0 on-hand, I lost 175 sales in Period 1.

The product is a swimwear item in the deep off-season (December), with recent demand averaging approximately 40-60 units per period, despite a brief spike during the late November promotional period. We currently have 590 units on hand, which is more than enough to cover the projected demand for the final two periods (estimated at ~120 units total). Ordering any additional stock at this stage would only increase holding costs without any possibility of additional sales revenue. Therefore, the optimal action is to place no order.",

Period 45 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Period 45 is the final period of the game (2019/12/30). The current on-hand inventory is 533 units, which is more than sufficient to cover any potential demand for this final period, especially given the off-season demand regime for swimwear (averaging ~50 units recently). Since this is the last period, any units ordered now would arrive after the game has ended and would only incur unnecessary lead-time risk if the game were longer, or simply be irrelevant. Furthermore, the objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs. Carrying 533 units already incurs a significant holding cost ($1.0/unit), so adding more inventory is counterproductive. I will place an order of 0 to minimize further costs and maximize the final reward.",
