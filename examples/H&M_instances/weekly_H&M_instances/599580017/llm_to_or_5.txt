Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019/2/25) for a Women's Swimwear item. The historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a significant upward trend: 61, 98, 152, 129, 213. This growth aligns with the end of February moving into Spring/Summer season for swimwear. The mean of all historical samples is 130.6, but the most recent sample (213) and the trend suggest a much higher regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand estimation to capture this growth while maintaining some stability. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR engine will compute the base stock using the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Given we start with 0 inventory (on-hand + in-transit), a robust order is needed immediately to cover the (L+1) = 3 periods of demand before the first shipment arrives.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Women's Swimwear). Current demand history [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175] shows a clear upward trend as we enter the spring/summer swimwear season (late February to early March). The last 3 periods average ~172 units/period, compared to the overall average of ~138. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this seasonal ramp-up. Regarding logistics: Period 1 concluded with an order of 237 units. Per the 'Promised lead time = 2', this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 4. No shipments are overdue yet. I'll maintain the default lead time but adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime to ensure the base stock covers the (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 516 units) while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including past history provided) is [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] and the last two periods under observation are 175 and 173. This indicates a clear upward shift in demand compared to the initial historical mean (130.6), likely due to the seasonality of 'Womens Swimwear' as we move into March. The demand has stabilized around 174 over the last two periods. The lead time for the Period 1 order was 1 period (arrived in Period 2), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, per instructions, we should remain cautious. On-hand inventory is 64 with 242 units in-transit (ordered Period 2, expected Period 3 or 4). I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time, and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand regime (approx 174 units/period) while accounting for the volatility shown in the pre-observation history.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear). Current demand history [175, 173, 181] shows high stability and volume, significantly higher than the pre-game samples provided. As of Period 4, on-hand inventory is 0. An order of 242 units placed in Period 2 is expected to arrive during Period 4 (based on the promised lead time of 2, and the observation that the Period 1 order arrived in 1 period). Demand is likely to increase as we move closer to beach season. Current mean demand is 176.3. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 529 units). The current pipeline is 337 units (242 from P2, 95 from P3). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current high demand regime and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variation in lead times (1 period observed, 2 periods promised).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Observed demand [175, 173, 181] is significantly higher than pre-game samples [61-213, avg 130]. Sustained avg ~176 across 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Demand has shown a significant upward trend: [175, 173, 181, 200], averaging 182.25 units over the last 4 periods, which is substantially higher than the initial history (avg 130). We experienced a stockout in Periods 3 and 4 because the lead time is inconsistent. While Period 1 arrived in 1 period (actual lead time), the orders from Period 2 (242 units), Period 3 (95 units), and Period 4 (21 units) are still in transit (total 358 units). The promised lead time is 2, and Period 2's order is now exactly at the promised lead time (placed P2, should arrive P4 or P5). Given the recent demand increase to 200, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this growth (Avg ~182 * (1+L)). Sigma is also adjusted to reflect this higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from 130 to 182 over last 4 periods (+40%). Lead time variability noted: P1 order arrived in 1 period, but subsequent orders are pending.

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing a midrise bikini bottom (Swimwear) entering April, which is a peak seasonal window. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: [175, 173, 181, 200, 268]. The mean demand of the last 5 periods is 199.4, significantly higher than the pre-game average of 130.6. There is also lead time variability: Period 1 order took 1 period, but Period 2 order took 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2. The pipeline (319 units) includes orders from P3 (95), P4 (21), and P5 (203). We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand). To account for the seasonal surge and the high probability of 3-period lead times, I will set L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent growth trend (approx 200 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 5 periods to capture the increasing volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed as April approaches (Swimwear seasonality): Last 5 periods mean 199.4 vs pre-game 130.6 (+52%). Lead time variability observed: range [1, 3] periods.

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (April 8th). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is entering its peak season. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: P1-P3 avg ~176, P4-P6 avg ~281 (+60% increase). Demand reached 376 in P6. The current lead time is volatile: P1=1, P2=3, P3=3, P4=2, resulting in an average of 2.25. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (468) includes orders from P5 (203 units) and P6 (265 units). Based on swimwear seasonality, demand will likely stay high or increase further in April. I am using recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg 281), and calculate for L to account for the actual observed variability (avg 2.25). This ensures the base stock covers (L+1) = ~3.25 periods of demand (~913 units), which helps the backend order enough to overcome current stockouts while accounting for the high in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: P4-P6 average demand is 281.3, a 59% increase over the P1-P3 average of 176.3. Average observed lead time shifted to 2.25 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-April (2019/4/15), entering the peak season for women's swimwear (SKU 599580017). Historical demand has shifted from an average of ~176 (P1-P3) to ~313 (P5-P7), indicating a strong upward trend as weather warms. The current on-hand inventory is 0, while 669 units are in-transit (orders from P5, P6, and P7). Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average: [1+3+3+2]/4 = 2.25). Given the promised lead time is 2 but 3 is frequently observed, I will set L to 2.25 using 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend accounts for the risk of a 3-period delay. Demand is clearly in a high-growth phase; I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level (avg ~313) which reflects the current seasonal regime. The high pipeline (669) relative to demand should be balanced by the OR backend's safety stock calculation to mitigate the stockout risk seen in 5 of the last 7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand (P5-P7) average is 313.0, a 77% increase over the March average (P1-P4) of 182.25, aligning with swimwear seasonality. Lead time variability is significant, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), and we are currently in late April (2019/04/22), which is the peak pre-summer season. Demand has surged significantly: the average demand in Period 6-8 is 346 units, compared to the overall average of 254 and the initial pre-game average of 130. There is a clear upward trend as we move deeper into spring. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 1,075 units (from P5, P6, P7, and P8). Historically, lead times have been volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods), with recent orders from P7 and P8 still in transit. Given the high season, I will use an explicit forecast to capture the accelerating demand (targeting ~400 units per period) and set L to 3 to account for the recent delays in arrivals and ensure the 'base_stock' calculation covers the 1+3 period window. This aggressive approach helps mitigate stockouts during the seasonal peak despite the high holding cost, as the stockout risk is currently very high.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late April: P6-P8 average demand is 346 units (+23% vs P4-P6 average of 281). Seasonal peak for swimwear is confirmed.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (late April), approaching the peak season for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Demand is in a high-growth regime: Period 9 demand reached 477 units, and the average demand over the last three periods (P7-P9) is 379.7 units. This represents a significant increase from earlier periods. The current date (2019/4/29) suggests May/June will likely see even higher demand before stabilizing. Regarding lead times, the history shows high volatility (min: 1, max: 3). Although the promised lead time is 2, the average observed lead time is 2.16. Order P5 (203 units) and P7 (201 units) are currently missing/overdue, while P8 (ordered at P8) arrived exceptionally fast in Period 9. With 194 units on hand and 925 in transit, we need to ensure the base stock covers the anticipated seasonal peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the most recent accelerating growth and set L to 'calculate' to account for the observed lead time variability in the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late April: P7-P9 average demand is 380 units (+35% vs P4-P6 average of 281). Seasonal peak for swimwear entering May/June is confirmed. Lead time remains volatile [1, 3] with an average of 2.2 periods.

We are in Period 11 (2019/5/6). The product is Swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief), currently in its seasonal peak. Demand has significantly accelerated: Period 8-10 demands were [367, 477, 468], with a 3-period average of 437.3 units. This is a clear upward shift from the April average. Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods: observed lead times are [1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3], averaging 2.28 periods. Current on-hand is 0, and the pipeline contains 724 units (ordered in Period 9 and 10). To address the rising May demand and lead time uncertainty, I am using a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level (~437 units per period) and calculating the average lead time from history to better reflect the true L (2.28) compared to the promised 2 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for May: P8-P10 average demand increased to 437 units (+26% vs P7-P9 average of 346). Seasonal peak is intensifying. Actual lead time mean is 2.28 periods based on 7 completed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is Women's Swimwear, which is entering its peak seasonal demand period in May/June. Demand has shown a significant upward trend: the average demand of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 411 units, compared to the initial periods. Although demand dropped slightly to 332 in P11, this is likely a minor fluctuation within a high-demand regime rather than a trend reversal, as seasonal peaks for swimwear typically sustain through June. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed average of approximately 2.3 periods (7 completed arrivals: 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2). I will use L=2.3 (explicit) to account for this variability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~411). For sigma_hat, N=4 will also be used to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand volumes. This approach ensures the base stock covers (L+1) = 3.3 periods of high demand to avoid stockouts during the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for May peak: P8-P11 average demand is 411 units. Lead time remains volatile across [1, 3] periods with a calculated average of 2.28 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/20), which is the peak season for women's swimwear. The last four periods (P9-P12) show high demand [477, 468, 332, 417], with an average of 423.5. This confirms a sustained regime shift compared to March/April. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. The in-transit pipeline is 958 units (comprising orders from P10=0, P11=224, P12=531, plus some older potentially lost units). Observed lead times are volatile: {1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2}, averaging 2.25 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current May peak demand level while setting lead time to 'calculate' to account for the observed average drift slightly above the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: May peak demand regime confirmed: P9-P12 average demand is 423.5 units (+35% vs P5-P8 average of 314). Supply chain volatility persists with actual lead times ranging between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late May (Period 14), which is peak season for women's swimwear. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trend from March (~180/period) to May (averaging ~380-420/period). Demand in the last four periods (P10-P13) has been 468, 332, 417, and 370, averaging 396.75. Although the raw mean of the last 4 periods is slightly lower than the 'May peak' suggested in previous carry-overs, this is likely due to lost sales/stockouts in P10, P12, and P13 suppressing observed demand or reflecting slight variance. To stay protective during peak season, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current regime (~400/period). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1:1, P2:3, P3:3, P4:2, P6:3, P8:1, P7:3, P9:2). The calculated average lead time is approx 2.25. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times (~2.2-2.3), which is more realistic than the promised 2. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 958 units in-transit (orders from P11 and P12). We must maintain a high base stock to avoid further stockouts during this peak demand window.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/06/03. The SKU is Women's Swimwear, which is now entering its peak seasonal demand period. Recent demand (P10-P14) has averaged 422.4 units, compared to the previous five-period average of 356.6, confirming an upward trend. The 'In-transit' balance of 734 includes a likely lost shipment of 203 units from Period 5 (now 10 periods old) and the Period 12 order of 531. Since on-hand is 0 and we are entering the highest demand months (June/July), we need to set parameters that ensure high service levels while accounting for the lost units. I am setting L to 2.22 based on the average of the 8 successfully concluded shipments to better reflect the true supply chain delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (~411 units per period) which, when scaled by (1+L), allows the OR backend to target a base stock level sufficient for the peak season. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to handle the increased volatility seen in May/June.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed shipment loss: Period 5 order (203 units) is over 9 periods past its promised delivery and is unlikely to arrive. June demand regime established: P11-P14 average demand is 411 units, confirming the peak summer season for swimwear.

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 16 (June 10), the height of the summer season for women's swimwear. Demand remains high but has stabilized slightly from the May peak. The last four periods of demand (P12-P15) are [417, 370, 525, 330], averaging 410.5 units. The shipment from P5 is confirmed lost (10 periods late), so the pipeline inventory of 922 units includes P12 (531 units) and P15 (188 units), plus the lost P5 (203 units). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the lost shipment, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the actual upper bound of observed lead times [1, 3] and prevent under-ordering. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current June demand regime (mean ~411) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for recent high volatility (std ~84). This approach aims to restore on-hand inventory for the remaining peak weeks while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/6/17. Product: Swimwear (Peak Season). We are in the middle of June, which is the high-demand period for this category. Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 388.8 units. The order from Period 5 (203 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 11 periods past its decision phase with no arrival. Current on-hand is 0, and pipeline inventory is 1472 units (Orders from P12, P15, and P16). History shows arrivals are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a calculated average around 2.2-2.3 periods. To account for this lead time variability and the seasonality peak, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the high June demand regime (mean ~389) rather than the long-term average which includes pre-season lows. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime confirmed: P12-P16 average demand is 388.8 units, sustaining the summer peak. Order from P5 (203 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment.

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 18 (late June). Demand for women's swimwear remains in its peak summer regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 408.8 units. The supply chain remains volatile, with observed lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.33). I am treating the Period 5 order (203 units) as lost, as confirmed in carry-over insights. The Period 12 order (531 units) is now 5 periods past its order date and is likely lost or severely delayed; this creates a massive gap in availability, evidenced by 0 on-hand inventory. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed 2.33 average. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the sustained summer peak (mean ~391), which covers the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set using N=6 to account for recent volatility. The OR backend will use these to replenish against the pipeline, though the pipeline is currently inflated by likely-lost units from P12.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Shipment from Period 12 (531 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, similar to the P5 loss. Total reliable pipeline inventory is likely only 738 units (P15 and P16 orders).

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (July 1st) is the heart of the swimwear season. Recent demand has spiked significantly, with Period 18 showing a record demand of 771 units, likely a July 4th peak. This pushes the recent 4-period average (P15-P18) to 480 units, much higher than the June average of ~388. Lead times are volatile; the Period 15 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 18), but orders from Period 5 and Period 12 (734 total units) are missing and presumed lost. The in-transit inventory of 1284 includes 550 units from P16 (due since P18/P19) and the 734 lost units. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set mu_hat to cover the peak demand (1+L periods) while accounting for the fact that the OR engine will subtract the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Using L=calculate (avg ~2.3) and mu_hat/sigma_hat with recent_N=4 captures the intense July demand regime. This aggressive setting helps offset the impact of the lost shipments still appearing in the pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed: Period 18 demand reached 771 units (+98% vs June average). Supply chain reliability remains low; 734 units across Period 5 and Period 12 orders are officially considered lost.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (July 8), entering the peak of the swimwear summer season. Last period's demand was 592, and the period before reached 771, confirming a significant July surge. The 'In-transit' quantity is 1284, but history shows extreme supply chain unreliability: orders from Period 5 (203 units) and Period 12 (531 units) are long overdue and effectively lost. Only the orders from Period 16 (550 units) and potentially more recent unlisted orders are viable. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a high-demand regime (July average ~681), I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this seasonality and the need to aggressively replenish. Lead time is set to 3 periods to reflect the persistent delays (calculated average is ~2.3, but most recent successful arrivals took 3 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility of the current peak season demand.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak confirmed: P18-P19 average demand is 681.5 units, nearly double the June average. Supply chain reliability remains a major risk; 734 units from Period 5 and Period 12 are confirmed lost.

Demand has surged dramatically, with Period 18-20 averaging 635 units, nearly double the June levels. Supply chain reliability is the primary challenge: orders from Period 5 (203 units) and Period 12 (531 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 734 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline that the OR engine would otherwise count as arriving. To counteract this, I must set 'L' to an explicit value that accounts for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of lost shipments. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) to capture the July peak (avg ~635). sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the high volatility during this seasonal spike. The high pipeline inventory of 2285 units includes the 734 lost units; by setting L=3 and mu_hat based on the peak demand, the OR engine's base-stock calculation (approx 2500+ units) should still trigger necessary replenishment despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: July peak demand sustained: P18-P20 average demand is 635 units. Confirmed cumulative shipment loss of 734 units (P5 and P12 orders) which remains in 'In-transit' but will not arrive.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period for women's swimwear (July 22nd). Recent demand (P18-P21) has averaged 603.75 units, significantly higher than the early season. Total in-transit inventory is listed as 2743 units, but my analysis confirms that orders from P5 (203 units) and P12 (531 units), totaling 734 units, are lost shipments and will not arrive. This leaves an effective pipeline of 2009 units (P16: 550, P20: 1001, P21: 458). No units arrived in P21, keeping on-hand inventory at 0. Given the high demand and the 1-3 period lead time volatility, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current peak (635 units/period) multiplied by L+1 (3 periods) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the remaining high-season demand. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high demand variance and supply chain uncertainty. I am using the calculated lead time to reflect the actual average of ~2.3 periods rather than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: July peak sustained: P18-P21 average demand is 603.8 units. Supply chain reliability remains poor; total confirmed lost inventory is 734 units (P5 and P12 orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2549.00

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 23 (July 29), which represents the tail end of the July demand peak for swimwear. The demand in Period 22 was 710 units, and the average demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) is approximately 588.5 units. While July saw a massive surge, we expect a slight tapering as we move into August, although demand remains historically high compared to the spring. On-hand inventory is 291 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 1742 units, but we must account for confirmed lost shipments from Period 5 (203 units) and Period 12 (531 units), totaling 734 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 1008 units (comprised of the P16 order of 550 units and the P21 order of 458 units). The P16 order is now 7 periods old and significantly overdue, while the P21 order is within the normal lead time window. Given the extreme supply chain volatility (actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, with significant losses), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend builds enough buffer for the (L+1) period demand window. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the July peak (averaging ~625) while allowing for the high variance observed (sigma_hat recent_N=5). This approach ensures we maintain a high service level for the remaining summer season while accounting for the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak sustained: P19-P22 average demand is 588.5 units. Effective pipeline inventory is reduced by 734 units due to confirmed losses from P5 and P12. P16 order (550 units) is now 7 periods overdue and highly suspect.

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (August 5th), the swimwear season is entering its late-summer phase. Demand in Period 23 dropped to 309 units from a July peak average of ~600, signaling the expected seasonal cooldown. I will use a 4-period window (P20-P23) to calculate demand, which averages 517.75 units. This accounts for the high July demand while incorporating the recent drop. Regarding the supply chain, the in-transit total of 2397 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 5 (203), Period 12 (531), and Period 16 (550) are effectively lost, totaling 1284 units. This leaves a reliable pipeline of 1113 units (orders from P21 and P23). Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3, average ~2.3), I am setting L to 2.3 to reflect actual performance. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current demand trend, and sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to account for the high variance observed during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: P16 order (550 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total confirmed lost pipeline inventory to 1284 units (P5, P12, P16). Demand has begun its seasonal decline as of August (P23 demand: 309 vs July avg: 600).

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (August 12), demand for 'Swimwear' has entered a clear post-peak seasonal decline. Demand dropped from an average of ~600 units in July (Periods 18-22) to 309 in Period 23 and 176 in Period 24. This follows the expected retail lifecycle for swimwear in late summer. Regarding inventory, the total 'In-transit' is 1939 units, but my analysis confirms 1284 units are lost: Period 5 (203), Period 12 (531), and Period 16 (550). Subtracting these from the 1939 in-transit units leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 655 units (the order from Period 23). With 282 units on-hand and 655 incoming, total effective inventory is 937. Since demand is declining (last period was 176), I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 samples to capture this downward trend (average ~243). I will use explicit values to account for the lost shipments that the OR backend cannot see, essentially reducing the target stock to prevent over-ordering while demand fades.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline confirmed for August: Period 23-24 average is 242.5 units, down from July peak of ~600 (-60%). Total cumulative shipment loss confirmed at 1284 units (Orders from P5, P12, and P16).

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: It is August 19, 2019. The product is a swimwear item, and demand is in a clear post-peak seasonal decline. Demand over the last two periods (P24-P25) has dropped to an average of 154 units, compared to the July peak of ~600. Lead time remains volatile but averages around 2.3 periods for successful deliveries. 

Inventory Analysis: On-hand is 150. The in-transit total of 1939 units includes 1284 units confirmed lost (P5, P12, P16 orders). The only active order is from Period 23 (655 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 25 or 26. Since P25 conclude showed 0 arrivals, it is highly likely to arrive during the current Period 26. 

Decision: To prevent overstocking during the seasonal downturn (where holding costs of $1/unit are high relative to $4 profit), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime. I use N=3 to capture the transition from the end of July into August. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delays (average ~2.3) rather than the promised 2 periods, helping the OR engine better account for the pipeline needs. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility of the declining phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline for swimwear confirmed: August (P23-P25) average demand is 205.7 units, down 66% from the July peak. Cumulative shipment loss remains 1284 units (P5, P12, P16).

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is in a post-peak seasonal decline as we move through late August (Period 27). Recent demand (P24-P26: 176, 132, 155) shows a significant drop from the July peak of ~600, confirming the 'End of Summer' regime. The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~154 units. On-hand inventory is 650 units, which covers over 4 periods of current demand. In-transit inventory consists of 1284 units from P5, P12, and P16; these are officially categorized as lost shipments (overdue by 11 to 22 periods) and should be ignored for logic purposes. The actual lead time has stabilized around 3 periods (observed for P21 and P23). Given the current excess on-hand inventory relative to the declining demand, the OR backend will naturally suppress new orders. I will use N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed for late August: P24-P26 average demand is 154 units (-74% vs July peak). Total confirmed cumulative shipment loss remains 1284 units (P5, P12, P16).

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 (Sept 2nd). The product is 'Womens Swimwear', which is now well past its seasonal peak (July). Demand has stabilized at a lower post-peak regime: the average demand for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is 142 units, a significant drop from the July average of ~600. On-hand inventory is 511 units, which covers approximately 3.6 periods of current demand. Pipeline inventory (1284 units) consists of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 12, and 16; these units will not arrive and must be ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory is already high relative to the current demand regime and we are entering the off-season for swimwear, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand decline using N=4 (P24-P27) to capture the trend, and L to 2.29 (the calculated average of non-lost shipments). This will result in a base stock level lower than current on-hand, causing the OR backend to place an order of 0 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed for September: P25-P27 average demand is 142 units, confirming seasonal wind-down. Total confirmed cumulative shipment loss remains 1284 units (P5, P12, P16).

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (early September). The product is 'Womens Swimwear', which is in a clear seasonal decline. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) was 155, 139, and 78, showing a consistent drop as summer ends. The current on-hand inventory is 433 units, which is significantly higher than recent demand levels. Given the seasonal wind-down, the primary objective is to minimize holding costs while the existing stock covers several weeks of the remaining low-season demand. No new orders are needed. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this sharp downward trend (P26-P28 avg: 124), and L is set to 'calculate' based on history. The OR backend will see that on-hand (433) exceeds the required base stock, resulting in a zero order, which is optimal to flush out inventory.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal demand decline confirmed: Demand dropped from an average of ~205 in early August to 78 in the most recent period. Current stock level (433) is sufficient to cover late-season demand without further ordering.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product (Womens Swimwear) is in a clear seasonal decline following the July peak. Demand has dropped significantly: the average demand over the last 3 periods (P27-P29) is 94 units, compared to the July peak of ~600 units. On-hand inventory is currently 368 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of the current demand regime. Given that the season is winding down and the holding cost is $1.0/unit/period, avoiding excess inventory is critical to maximize total reward. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1284 units represents orders from P5, P12, and P16 which are confirmed lost and will not arrive; however, the OR backend's capped policy will still subtract these from the base stock calculation. To prevent the backend from triggering unnecessary orders while accounting for the seasonal drop, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the August/September decline (average ~109 units). This keeps the base stock target low enough that current on-hand inventory should prevent any new orders from being placed.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal decline confirmed: September demand (P27-P29) average is 94 units (-85% vs July peak). Existing on-hand inventory (368 units) is sufficient for the remainder of the season.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis for SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) shows a clear seasonal wind-down as we enter late September. Demand has dropped from a July peak of ~600 units to just 30 units in Period 30. The last three periods (P28-P30) average 57.6 units. With 338 units currently on-hand, we have over 5-10 periods of cover at current sales rates. The 1284 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses from Periods 5, 12, and 16; however, since on-hand inventory is already more than sufficient for the off-season, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from triggered unnecessary orders, thereby minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand decline confirmed: Late September demand dropped to 30 units, with a 3-period average of 57.6 units (-90% from July peak). On-hand inventory is now sufficient for the remainder of the year.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms), and the current date is September 30 (Period 32). Historical data shows a clear seasonal peak in July (approx. 600 units/period) followed by a sharp decline starting in August. September demand (P28-P31) has dropped significantly, averaging approximately 52 units per period (78, 65, 30, 35). With 303 units currently on-hand and the season ending, the existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the remaining periods of the game (ending at Period 45). Ordering more at this stage would only increase holding costs and lead to excess ending inventory, reducing total reward. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend identifies no need for further replenishment.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand regime confirmed: September/October demand is consistently low, averaging ~50 units (P28-P31). Total lost pipeline inventory remains 1284 units (P5, P12, P16).

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear), and the current date is October 7th. Historical data shows demand has entered a definitive post-peak seasonal decline following the July peak (~600 units). In the most recent four periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 48 units. Current on-hand inventory is 241 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the projected end-of-season demand for several periods. The OR backend's pipeline inventory includes 1284 units from lost shipments (P5, P12, P16), so the backend already calculates 'in-transit' as very high, which would naturally suppress ordering. However, to ensure the backend aligns with the sharp seasonal drop and avoids any unnecessary procurement while holding costs are $1/unit, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the low-demand regime accurately. Lead time remains volatile but irrelevant for immediate ordering due to high inventory relative to current demand.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is October 14, 2019 (Period 34). The product is women's swimwear, which is now in its post-peak off-season. Historical demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 51.3 units over the last 6 periods (P28-P33). On-hand inventory is 203 units, which provides approximately 4 periods of safety stock at the current burn rate. The 1284 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 12, and 16 and should not be relied upon for fulfillment. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the approaching end of the game (Period 45), the priority is to avoid overstocking while demand continues its seasonal decline. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this low-demand regime. No new orders are expected or required at this stage as current stock levels are sufficient for near-term demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item (bikini bottoms), and we are currently in late October (Period 35). The historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: demand peaked in July (approx. 600 units/period) and has steadily declined through August and September. In the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has stabilized at a low end-of-season level, averaging 41.6 units per period. With 160 units currently on-hand and an additional 1284 units in 'In-transit' (which are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 12, and 16), the physical stock of 160 is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the remaining 10 periods of the year (estimated at ~400 units total if current trends hold). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, and the fact that we are past the seasonal peak, the priority is to avoid accumulating excess inventory that will incur holding costs throughout the winter. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, which will result in no new orders being placed by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season low demand regime confirmed: October demand (P31-P34) averaged 44.5 units, down from the July peak of ~600. Current inventory levels are sufficient for the remainder of the calendar year.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear bottom, which has now fully entered its post-peak/off-season demand regime. Recent demand from Period 31 to 35 has been consistently low, averaging 44.5 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 110 units, which covers more than 2 periods of the current average demand. Given the seasonal decline evidenced in the Carry-over Insights (down from ~600 in July to ~45 in October), and the fact that we are in late October (Period 36), demand is expected to remain at these low levels or decrease further as winter approaches. No further orders are required to maintain a sufficient service level, especially since the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0. The pipeline inventory (1284 units) consists entirely of orders from P5, P12, and P16 which have been confirmed as lost shipments across multiple periods of history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect this stabilized low-demand regime and 'default' for lead time since no new orders are being placed.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in a deep post-peak seasonal decline as of November 4th. Demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging approximately 43.4 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 74 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly two periods of demand at the current rate. Given that the promised lead time is 2 periods and demand is likely to remain low or continue decreasing into the winter months, no additional orders are necessary. Ordering more would only incur holding costs without generating significant additional sales. The 1284 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the season (P5, P12, P16) and are correctly ignored in the pipeline calculation. I am setting parameters to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent further ordering by the OR backend.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 38 (Nov 11), deep in the low-demand off-season for swimwear. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (P31-P37) has been consistently low, with an average of approximately 42.1 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 40 units. While this is slightly below the recent average demand, the cost of holding inventory ($1.00) relative to the profit margin ($4.00) makes it inefficient to place new orders for small quantities, especially considering the 2-period lead time and high probability of further seasonal decline as winter approaches. The 'In-transit' figure of 1284 units represents the cumulative lost shipments from Period 5 (203), Period 12 (531), and Period 16 (550), which the OR engine will continue to count as pipeline stock. By setting L to 'calculate' and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=7), we align the backend with the current low-demand regime. This results in a low base stock level, ensuring no unnecessary orders are placed while we liquidate the remaining 40 units of on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Swimwear) has entered its end-of-season low-demand phase in November. Current demand (P36-P38) is consistently low, averaging ~37 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline inventory 'In-transit' of 1284 units is confirmed lost (Orders from P5, P12, and P16). Although on-hand inventory reached 0 after Period 38, the forecasted demand for the remaining periods (P39-P45) is extremely low. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods and the actual lead time variability (averaging ~2.3), any order placed now would arrive around Period 42. Since the season is ending and the holding cost is $1.0 vs a $4.0 profit, the risk of overstocking at the very end of the game outweighs the marginal profit from a few units of demand. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (last 5 periods) and allow the OR engine to determine if a small final order is necessary, while accounting for the lost pipeline inventory by ensuring the backend does not count those 1284 units as available stock.

Carry-over insight: November low-demand regime confirmed: P34-P38 average demand is 41 units, continuing the seasonal decline. Pipeline inventory of 1284 units (P5, P12, P16) remains confirmed lost and should be excluded from effective inventory calculations.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (late November). The product is swimwear, and demand has followed a clear seasonal cycle: a peak in July (approx. 600-700 units) followed by a steady decline through autumn. In the most recent four periods (P36-P39), demand has averaged 32.25 units, with the latest observation at 17 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 1284 units. However, as documented in Carry-Over Insights, all 1284 units in the pipeline are from orders placed in Period 5, Period 12, and Period 16, which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Therefore, effective inventory is 0. Given we are at the end of the game (Period 40 of 45) and the low-demand winter season, we need to order enough to satisfy the remaining 5 periods of low demand while avoiding excessive holding costs. Setting mu_hat to use the recent 6 periods (N=6, average ~35 units) captures the current winter regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historical average of 2.28 periods. This configuration will trigger an order to cover the remaining game duration without overstocking for the off-season.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 41 (Dec 2, 2019), approaching the final periods of the game (total 45). The product is swimwear, which is in its absolute seasonal trough during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Demand has been consistently low since September, with the most recent period (P40) showing a demand of 113, likely a minor outlier or a very early holiday cruise purchase, compared to the P35-P39 average of ~36 units. On-hand inventory is 0. However, 'In-transit' inventory still shows 1284 units, which are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 12, and 16. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, it currently believes we have 1284 units coming. This prevents the system from ordering. To trigger an order to cover the remaining 5 periods of low demand, I must set the lead time L to 'explicit' (to match the observed volatility/delays) and mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom 1284 units if I wanted to order. HOWEVER, with only 4 periods left and a lead time of 2-3 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 43 or 44. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the very low end-of-season demand, the risk of holding excess inventory into the game's end outweighs the small profit from potential sales in the last 2 periods. Therefore, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime but won't force a large order to overcome the lost-shipment accounting error, as it's not economically sound this late in the year.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (December 9th), approaching the final weeks of the simulation (total 45 periods). The product is Swimwear, which is currently in its off-season demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 51.4 units, with a notable outlier in P40 (113 units) possibly related to early holiday shopping or clearance. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1284 units consists of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 5, 12, and 16, and should not be considered effective pipeline inventory. On-hand inventory is currently 0. While demand is low, we need to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (L+1 = 3). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (avg 51.4 * 3 = 154.2) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 will prompt the OR backend to place a small order to meet this end-of-season demand while accounting for the lost pipeline stock it normally includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation.

Period 43 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 of 45, which is the off-season for swimwear. The game ends in 3 periods. With a promised lead time of 2, an order placed now in the Period 43 decision phase will arrive during the Period 45 arrival resolution phase, making it available for Period 45 demand. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) averages 56 units, though this includes a likely Black Friday spike (113 units) in P40. Excluding that spike, the average is ~42 units. To cover the remaining demand for P43, P44, and P45, we need to account for approximately 120-150 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and the 1284 units in-transit are confirmed lost (from P5, P12, and P16), we must place an order to satisfy the final period. I am setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use an explicit value of 150 (roughly 50 units/period for 3 periods: L+1) to ensure the backend targets a base stock that covers the end-of-game demand without over-ordering, as there are no subsequent periods to sell excess stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low-season volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (late December). The product is a swimwear item ('Timeless Midrise Brief'), which is in its extreme off-season. Recent demand (P39-P43) has been very low, averaging around 59 units, with a slight spike in P40 (113 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. While the item is off-season, we are approaching the end of the year and the start of a new calendar cycle where demand will eventually begin to rise again (as seen in Period 1/February of last year). However, for the immediate short term, demand remains low. The pipeline inventory (1284 units) consists of orders from P5, P12, and P16, all of which are confirmed lost as they are months overdue. I will treat effective pipeline as 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current winter demand regime (avg ~59) while maintaining a small buffer for the current zero-stock situation. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed lead time (~2.3 periods).

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (late December). The demand for this SKU (Swimwear) has settled into a low-volume off-season regime, averaging approximately 58 units per period over the last 4 weeks (P41-P44). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit inventory of 1284 units consists of confirmed lost shipments (P5, P12, P16) that will never arrive. To meet demand for the immediate lead time (L=2) and review period (1), we need to ensure the system targets a base stock that covers these low-demand periods. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0), and the fact that we are in the deepest part of the off-season, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low demand (approx 50-60 units). Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to use the historical average lead time (~2.3 periods), which is appropriate given the seasonal stability.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year off-season demand regime confirmed: P41-P44 average demand is 55.7 units. Cumulative pipeline loss remains 1284 units (P5, P12, P16).
