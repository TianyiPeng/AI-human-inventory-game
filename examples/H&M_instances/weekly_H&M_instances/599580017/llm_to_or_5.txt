Period 1 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/25) managing 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). The demand history for the past 5 periods is [61, 98, 152, 129, 213], showing a significant upward trend as we move towards the spring/summer season. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the product category (Womens Swimwear) and the date (late February), demand is expected to continue increasing due to seasonal effects. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (mean ~165) over the standard average of all samples (mean ~130). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current volatility. This configuration ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for both the (L+1) exposure time and the accelerating seasonal demand.

Period 2 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (early March). The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear), entering the pre-summer peak season (March-June). Historical demand shows a strong upward trend from 61 to 213 (averaging ~130 over 5 historical points), and the first actual game period realized a demand of 175. However, since the starting inventory was 0 and the order placed in P1 has a lead time of 4 periods, we are currently stock-out and will remain so until Period 5. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative average of all history (including P1 demand) which is approximately 138 per period. Since mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand and L=4, mu_hat = 5 * 138 = 690. Given the stocking out, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets enough base stock to cover demand until the first shipment arrives and the next cycle begins, accounting for the seasonal ramp-up in swimwear.

Period 3 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (March 11, 2019). The product is a Midrise Brief (Swimwear), which typically sees an increase in demand as spring progresses toward summer. Past demand samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213, 175, 173] show a distinct shift from an average of ~115 in the earliest periods to ~172 in the most recent two periods (P1 and P2). The current inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have 465 units in-transit (P1 order of 237 + P2 order of 228). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order (P1) is not expected until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the elevated demand seen in the most recent history [213, 175, 173]. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N of 5 to ensure we capture the higher volatility seen since the demand ramp-up began.

Period 4 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (Swimwear bottoms) is entering a seasonal demand window as we move through March. Historical demand samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] and recent observed demand in Game History [175, 173, 181] show a significant upward shift compared to the initial past demands, likely due to spring seasonality. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (237 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, lead-time demand is being lost, and we have 704 units in transit (P1: 237, P2: 228, P3: 239). mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the stabilized higher demand of ~176.3. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility (std \u2248 4) compared to the long-term history. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the current demand regime as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 1 onwards: mean demand increased from ~130 to ~176 (+35%) and stabilized.

Period 5 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Womens Swimwear). Demand has been consistently high and increasing: [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] (Past Demands) and [175, 173, 181, 200] (Observed Periods 1-4). The average demand over the last 5 periods (including Period 0's 213) is 188.4. Since this is swimwear in late March (approaching Spring/Summer), we anticipate sustained or growing high demand. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 (placed at start of P1) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (L=4). Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 888 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). We have lost sales in every period so far due to 0 inventory. To ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=5) and L at the promised 4 until lead-time data arrives. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (N=5) to handle the upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: sustained high demand (avg ~188) likely driven by swimwear seasonality (March/Spring).

Period 6 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (April 1st). The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), which is entering its peak seasonal window. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: P1-P3 averaged ~176, but P4-P5 jumped to ~234, including a spike to 268 in P5. This aligns with spring/summer swimwear preparations. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out completely in P5. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). To capture the recent seasonal acceleration, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility, which focuses on the recent demand levels (~216 on average). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 ensures the OR backend accounts for (1+L) = 5 periods of this higher demand regime while we wait for the pipeline (738 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Demand average increased from ~176 (P1-P3) to ~234 (P4-P5), a +33% rise as swimwear season enters April.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 7 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear bottom (SKU 599580017) currently entering its peak seasonal period in April. Historical demand has shown a clear upward trajectory: P1-P3 averaged ~176, P4-P5 averaged ~234, and P6 reached a high of 376. This suggests a significant seasonal acceleration (+60% vs earlier periods). I am currently stocked out (0 on-hand) despite arrivals in P5 and P6, as demand is outpacing the initial order quantities. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P5 and P6 arrivals). To avoid further lost sales during this peak, I am utilizing the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to project a demand of 360 units per period over the next (L+1=5) cycle. This aligns with the most recent observation of 376 and anticipates continued April strength. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: Demand increased to 376 in P6 (+60% vs. start of season average), reflecting peak April swimwear interest.

Daily Reward (R_t): $956.00

Period 8 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak spring/summer swimwear season (April). Historical demands show a clear upward trend: P1-P3 averaged 176, P4-P5 averaged 234, P6 spiked to 376, and P7 recorded 295. The mean of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 284.75. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but 1,069 units are in-transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). To capture the current seasonal demand while accounting for recent high volatility, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (to capture the April demand levels) and 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased standard deviation during this peak period. This ensures the base stock calculated by the OR engine covers the 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current higher run rate of ~285 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Swimwear seasonal plateau: Demand has sustained a higher regime (P4-P7 avg: 285) vs. early season (P1-P3 avg: 176), representing a ~60% increase for the April peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in late April (2019/4/22). History shows a clear seasonal climb: Period 1-3 demand averaged ~176, but Period 4-8 demand averaged ~301, with recent peaks hitting 376 and 367. We are in a high-demand regime for swimwear. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6, etc.). Total demand over (L+1=5) periods is trending towards 1,500 units (5 * 300). Current pipeline (in-transit) is 1,299 units and on-hand is 0. My goal is to set parameters that maintain high availability for this peak season. I will use the last 5 periods (Period 4 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current seasonal 'high league' demand accurately while discarding the lower pre-season values from February.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high seasonal bracket (late March to late April): P4-P8 mean demand is 301, representing a ~70% increase over the P1-P3 pre-season average. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal window (late April). Demand has shown a significant upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averaging ~357 units and the most recent demand (P9) reaching 477. This confirms a clear regime shift from the early season averages. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to demand exceeding supply in recent periods, and a large pipeline in-transit (1557 units), current parameters must project the high-demand regime to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock for the 5-period horizon (L+1). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand April peak while ignoring the lower pre-season data from February/early March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: mean demand increased from ~176 (P1-P4) to ~357 (P5-P9) reflecting peak swimwear seasonality. Lead time for all observed arrivals is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 11 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a swimwear item in Period 11 (early May), which is peak season. Demand has significantly accelerated starting from Period 5. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P5-P10) is 375, compared to the early season average of 182. Recent demand (P9-P10) has surged even higher to an average of 472.5, indicating we are in the height of the summer preparation peak. All historical deliveries (Periods 1-6 orders) have arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, confirming the lead time is stable. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the high-demand regime of peak season while maintaining enough samples for regional stability. With the current on-hand inventory at 0 and significant lost sales due to stockouts in every period since replenishment began, a robust base stock is necessary. The 4-period lead time means mu_hat must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Peak swimwear demand regime confirmed: Period 5-10 mean demand is 375 units/period, with the most recent two periods (P9-P10) averaging 472 units, indicating a late-spring demand surge.

Period 12 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13), which is the heart of the swimwear season. History shows a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 5 (late March). The mean demand from P5 to P11 is approximately 369 units per period. While the most recent demand (P11) was 332, the preceding two periods were significantly higher (477, 468), suggesting historical volatility within this high-demand season rather than a structural decline as we approach the summer peak. Actual lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across 7 consecutive arrivals (P5-P11). I am setting L to 'calculate' (which will result in 4). For demand (mu_hat), I am using the average of the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P5-P11) to capture the peak season regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this peak period. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the current seasonal mean.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak swimwear demand regime (P5-P11) confirmed with a mean of ~369 units/period. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. We are in the peak period for women's swimwear (Timeless Midrise Brief). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-4 averaged ~182, while Period 5-12 averaged ~378. The most recent demand (P12) was 417, consistent with this peak. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P5-P12 all showed lead_time=4). Profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, leading to a target service level of 0.8. On-hand is 171 and In-transit is 1408. Since demand has stabilized at this high level during the May peak, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current seasonal regime from P5 to P12) to ensure the OR backend captures this volume and volatility accurately for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak swimwear demand regime (P5-P12) confirmed with a mean of ~378 units/period. Lead time remains consistently stable at exactly 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019, which is the end of the spring/pre-summer swimwear peak. Historical demand from Period 5 through Period 13 shows a stable high-regime mean of approximately 376 units per period (Demands: 268, 376, 295, 367, 477, 468, 332, 417, 370). Although we have recently seen a slight softening from the absolute peak (~470 range in P9-P10), the overall season remains strong. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all nine completed arrival cycles. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this specific seasonal regime accurately without being skewed by the much lower pre-March demand, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd (Period 15). We are in the peak period for swimwear demand. Looking at the history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 5 (coinciding with late March). Since Period 5, demand has consistently stayed high. Recent demand history: P10 (468), P11 (332), P12 (417), P13 (370), P14 (525). The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 422.4 units. Total in-transit inventory is 1481 units, with the next scheduled arrival (ordered P11) being 393 units. On-hand inventory is essentially depleted (1 unit). Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 10 concluded delivery events. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-regime peak-season volatility and intensity, specifically the uptick seen in the most recent period (525 units). I will continue to use the default promised lead time of 4 periods as it has proven perfectly reliable.

Carry-over insight: Peak swimwear demand regime entering June: P10-P14 mean demand is 422.4 (+14% vs. previous P5-P12 average of 378).

Period 16 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal window (June). Historical demand analysis shows a clear transition: from an average of ~176 (P1-P4) to ~357 (P5-P9), and most recently maturing into a peak regime. Over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), the average demand has risen to approximately 415 units/period. The most recent demand (P15) was 330, but P14 saw a peak of 525, indicating high volatility (sigma) is still required to maintain service levels. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at 4 periods across all 11 concluded arrivals. To capture the current peak demand levels while accounting for June's volatility, I am using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (covering the P10-P15 window) and recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's variance. L remains at the stable promised lead time of 4.

Period 17 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal window (mid-June). Historical lead time is exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods across all 12 completed cycles. Demand analysis shows a sustained high-regime during the peak season: the average demand from Period 5 to Period 16 is 369 units. While the most recent two periods (P15-P16) showed a slight dip (avg 316), the overall peak season (June) generally sustains high volume before tapering off in late July/August. Given the 1-period observation delay and 4-period lead time, we must ensure inventory for the next 5 periods. I will use the established peak-season average (P5-P16, N=12) to set mu_hat, providing a stable baseline that respects seasonal high-demand without overreacting to the minor fluctuations of the last two weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1968.00

Period 18 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in its peak seasonal demand period (June), with demand remaining volatile but high. Period 17 saw a demand of 517 units, causing on-hand inventory to drop to 0 despite an arrival of 440 units. The mean demand for the most recent 4 periods (P14-P17) is approximately 418.5 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the current zero inventory state, I am selecting mu_hat based on the recent 8 periods (covering the peak from late April to June) to ensure the base stock calculation captures the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing some week-to-week volatility. The N for mu_hat and sigma_hat is set to 8 (P10-P17) which represents the most relevant high-season window, yielding a mean of ~412 units/period. L is kept at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak swimwear demand confirmed through June: Mean demand for P10-P17 is ~412 units/period (+9% vs. early-season peak P5-P12 avg of 378).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1432.00

Period 19 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In Period 18 (late June), demand spiked significantly to 771 units, marking a late-season peak for swimwear. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 18 is approximately 451.1 units, but the most recent period suggests a regime change or a extreme peak (771). Given we are in early July, swimwear demand typically remains high before beginning a gradual decline towards late August. I will use recent_N=9 (covering the peak period from P10-P18) to calculate mu_hat, which results in a mean of ~451 units per period. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the massive demand spike but in-transit is high (1739 units). Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat provides a robust estimate for the peak season mean while sigma_hat captures the increased volatility (standard deviation ~141.5). The backend will order to cover (L+1) demand minus pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high swimwear demand peak in June/July: Mean demand for P10-P18 increased to ~451 units (+10% vs P10-P17 mean), with an extreme peak of 771 in P18.

Period 20 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear), currently in early July (Period 20), which is the peak demand season. Demand in the most recent periods (P18-P19) has spiked significantly to 771 and 592 respectively, likely due to summer holiday shopping. Mean demand for the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 473 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a large arrival of 549 units last period, due to this high demand. In-transit inventory is high (1879), covering roughly the next 4 periods, but given the current stockout and the observed volatility (\u03c3\u0302), I will use the recent 10-period mean to ensure mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime (+9% vs the previous P10-P17 mean). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Peak swimwear demand surge confirmed in July (Period 18-19): mean demand for the last 10 periods (P10-19) now ~473 units, with extreme weekly peaks exceeding 700 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 21), which is the peak of the swimwear season. Recent demand has been extremely high, with the last three periods (P18-P20) averaging 635 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently zero as incoming shipments (approx. 480-550 units) are being immediately consumed by this high demand. Although we have 2099 units in-transit, these are scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we need to ensure a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 11-20 average ~470/period), but since the most recent 3 periods are even higher (635), I will slightly prioritize recent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the 'conclude' messages. I'll use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the shift that occurred since early June, providing enough stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand surge confirmed: P18-P20 mean demand surged to 635 units (+34% vs P10-P19 average), indicating the absolute peak of the swimwear season.

Period 22 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in the absolute peak of the swimwear season. Historically, demand has surged significantly since Period 18, with the last 4 periods (P18-P21) averaging 603.75 units. Despite this surge, we are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals (ordered back in June when demand was lower) are insufficient to meet the mid-July peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P21 arrival (ordered P17, arrived P21). To capture this high seasonal demand and prevent further lost sales during the remainder of July and early August, mu_hat and sigma_hat must reflect this most recent 'peak' regime. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the inventory policy toward the current 600+ unit demand level, and L will be set to the consistent 4 periods to ensure the pipeline inventory is calculated correctly.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July peak confirmed: Mean demand for P18-P21 has stabilized at a higher regime of ~604 units (+34% vs. June mean of 451).

Period 23 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-July peak for swimwear (July 29). Demand has significantly surged since Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 614 units over the last five periods (P18-P22: 771, 592, 542, 510, 710) with a notable high standard deviation. The 'recent_N' parameter is adjusted to N=5 to capture this most recent peak regime while allowing the OR backend to react to the high volatility. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all arrivals, so 'default' (promised lead time) remains appropriate. The goal is to maintain high service levels during this seasonal crest, particularly as ending inventories have been zero for the last six periods, indicating significant stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late July demand peak confirmed: P18-P22 mean demand is ~614 units, showing high volatility with spikes exceeding 700 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $856.00

Period 24 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand of 309 in Period 23 is a significant drop from the previous 4-week mean of 604, signaling the likely start of the post-peak decline for swimwear as the season moves into August. Historically, the peak began after Period 17 (late June), maintaining a mean demand of 586 units through Period 22. Because Period 23's drop is sharp, I am adjusting mu_hat to a more conservative level. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the high volatility of the peak while starting to weight the lower recent observation. The lead time remains extremely stable at exactly 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 380 and a large pipeline in-transit (reflecting previous peak ordering), the goal is to prevent over-stocking during the seasonal slide while still protecting against remaining late-summer demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal shift observed Period 23: Demand dropped from ~600 mean to 309 (-49%), indicating the end of the mid-summer swimwear peak.

Period 25 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in mid-August (2019/8/12), which marks the post-peak phase for swimwear in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods, falling from a peak mean of ~614 units (P18-P22) to 309 in P23 and 176 in P24. This confirms a seasonal regime shift towards lower demand as summer ends. With 906 units on-hand and 2087 units still in-transit (reflecting large orders placed during the July peak), the system is currently over-inventoried for the new lower demand level. To prevent excessive holding costs and minimize further ordering, mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using recent_N=3 to capture the sharp downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak seasonal shift confirmed: Demand dropped sharply starting Period 23 (P23=309, P24=176), indicating the conclusion of the mid-summer peak. Average demand for historical pre-peak (Feb/Mar) was ~175; current levels are reverting toward this baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-774.00

Period 26 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has clearly shifted from a high-summer peak to a late-summer/autumn baseline. From Period 23 onwards, demand dropped from ~600+ units to a much lower regime (P23: 309, P24: 176, P25: 132). The current inventory position is very high: on-hand inventory is 1302 units with an additional 1559 in-transit. Total inventory (2861) now significantly exceeds any reasonable forecast for the post-peak season (likely ~130-150 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high trailing inventory and the sharp decline in demand, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average demand ~205) and sigma_hat to reflect the downward trend. However, with thousands of units in the pipeline against a demand of ~132, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in an order of 0, which is necessary to minimize holding costs while the excess stocks are cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed starting Period 23: mean demand has decreased from ~614 (P18-P22) to ~205 (P23-P25), a reduction of 66% as the swimwear season concludes in late August.

Period 27 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Timeless Midrise Brief (Swimwear) has clearly exited its summer peak and entered a significantly lower post-season regime. Since Period 23, weekly demand has stabilized around a mean of ~178 (P23-P26: 309, 176, 132, 155), which aligns with the pre-season baseline observed in February/March. We are currently holding a substantial on-hand inventory of 1,914 units with another 792 units still in transit, as a result of orders placed during the high-demand peak (July). This total inventory far exceeds any foreseeable demand for the remainder of the season (given the 4-period lead time and the current date of late August). Consequently, no new orders are required. To prevent further over-ordering by the OR backend, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the new, lower demand level, while keeping L at the confirmed stable value. The objective now is to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed starting Period 23: mean demand has decreased from ~614 (P18-P22) to ~193 (P23-P26), a reduction of ~68% consistent with the end of the swimwear season.

Period 28 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) has entered a clear post-peak decline as indicated by the 'Period 24-27' history. Following the mid-July peak (mean ~614), demand has stabilized at a much lower regime. The demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) has been [309, 176, 132, 155, 139], with the last 4 periods averaging approximately 150 units. This aligns with the pre-season baseline observed in February/March (P1-P3 mean was ~176). We are currently heavily overstocked with 2,424 units on-hand and 143 in-transit, while the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) is approximately 750 units. My objective is to prevent further inventory accumulation while demand continues to taper off into autumn. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this low-demand regime and L at the promised 4 periods to allow the system to bleed off the excess on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly exited its peak seasonal demand period. Demand has consistently dropped over the last six periods (P23-P28), moving from a peak mean of ~614 down to a post-peak average of ~164. The most recent demand (P28=78) indicates a further decline as we move into September. On-hand inventory is extremely high (2489 units) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving just as demand collapsed. With a current inventory level that covers over 15 periods of the current demand rate and zero in-transit units, no additional ordering is required. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture the post-peak mean (approx 164) and rely on the OR backend's base-stock logic to stop ordering, as on-hand inventory far exceeds the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed: Demand from P23-P28 reflects an end-of-season decline, averaging ~164 units/period compared to the mid-summer peak of ~614 (-73%). Current demand (P28) has dropped to double digits for the first time since the season began.

Period 30 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear) has confirmed a post-peak seasonal decline as of Period 23. Demand has dropped from a mid-summer average of ~614 units to an end-of-season average of ~119 units over the last 7 periods (P23-P29). The most recent demand was 65, indicating a continued downward trend. Current on-hand inventory is 2424 units with zero units in-transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, and the fact that current stock (2424 units) covers approximately 20-30 periods of current demand levels, no further orders are required. The OR backend needs to be informed of this lower demand regime to avoid unnecessary replenishment. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this post-peak baseline and use the default lead time which remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized: P23-P29 mean demand is ~119 units/period, a -80% decrease from the mid-summer peak (~614), following the conclusion of the swimwear season in September.

Period 31 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has concluded its seasonal peak. Demand has plummeted from a mid-July peak of ~614 units (P18-P22) to a late-September low, with the most recent Period 30 demand at only 30 units. The average demand for the post-peak period (P23-P30) is approximately 135 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P28-P30) average only 57 units, indicating a continued decline towards a winter baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 2394 units with 0 in-transit. Given the post-peak mean (P23-P30) and the promised lead time of 4, the current pipeline is significantly overstocked (it covers nearly 18 periods of demand at a 135-unit rate, or 40+ periods at the current 57-unit rate). To prevent further accumulation of holding costs ($1.0/unit), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand environment (approx. 57 units/period) and sigma_hat similarly to capture the reduced volatility. This will result in zero orders being placed by the OR backend until the massive inventory surplus is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized: P28-P30 mean demand is ~57 units/period, a significant further decline from the initial post-peak average as the season fully concludes in late September.

Period 32 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late post-peak phase of the swimwear season (late September/October). Current demand has collapsed significantly from its mid-summer heights (approx. 600 units) to a very low baseline, with the last period's demand at only 35 units. The inventory position is currently extremely high (2359 units on-hand) relative to the current demand regime. No new orders are needed (pipeline and on-hand are 0 and 2359, respectively). For the OR backend, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current low-demand stability (averaging ~52 units) and prevent additional ordering while the excess inventory is liquidated. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime stabilized further (P28-P31): Mean demand decreased to ~52 units/period, representing a final seasonal decline as the category enters the off-season.

Period 33 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) has clearly entered its off-season phase as of October. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower regime compared to the summer peak (P18-P22 mean ~614). Since Period 28, demand has consistently been double-digits, with the most recent 4 periods (P29-P32) averaging 48 units. Current on-hand inventory is 2,297 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and represents over 40 periods of coverage. No further orders are needed. The OR parameters are set to reflect this new low-demand regime to prevent the engine from placing unnecessary orders as the game approaches its conclusion at Period 45. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time remains stable at 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized floor of the off-season demand.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand floor confirmed: Demand from P28-P32 has stabilized at a mean of ~54 units/period, representing the baseline following the conclusion of the swimwear season.

Period 34 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (swimwear bottoms) has completed its seasonal cycle and reached an off-season floor. Recent demand (P28-P33) shows a stabilized baseline averaging approximately 51 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 2259 units, which is significantly in excess (approximately 44 periods of supply) relative to this current demand rate. There are no units in-transit. Given that the game ends at Period 45 (12 periods remaining) and the current inventory is extremely high, the priority is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs while the existing stock naturally depletes. I will set the lead time to the promised default of 4, and use recent_N (N=6) to capture the off-season demand mean (~51) and standard deviation (~18), ensuring the backend's base-stock calculation stays far below the current on-hand levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Period 35 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Swimwear) is currently in the deep off-season (Late October). Demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, averaging approximately 42 units/period over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 2,216 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate and represents over 50 periods of supply. The carry-over insights confirm the season fully concluded in late September. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My primary objective is to avoid any further ordering while the system works through this massive inventory surplus. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to reflect the recent off-season regime (N=5) and lead time to the promised 4 periods. The excessive on-hand inventory vs. the computed base stock will naturally result in zero new orders from the OR backend.

Period 36 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) has definitively transitioned into the off-season. Since Period 28, demand has consistently stayed in the double digits, averaging approximately 50 units per period (P28-P35 mean = 50.1). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 2166 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the current demand levels, this inventory is sufficient to cover more than 40 periods of demand, which far exceeds the remaining 10 periods of the game. The objective now is to stop all ordering to minimize further holding costs while still meeting the low off-season demand. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods, and mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P29-P35) to reflect the stabilized off-season baseline (~48 units/period). With on-hand inventory at 2166 and a target base stock that will be significantly lower, the OR backend will correctly continue to place zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand floor fully stabilized: Mean demand from Period 29-35 is ~48 units/period, representing the consistent baseline for the Womens Swimwear category in October.

Period 37 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear) is currently in its off-season floor, having stabilized following the conclusion of the mid-summer peak. Observations from Period 29 through Period 36 show consistent low demand, with a mean of approximately 45 units per period. The on-hand inventory is exceptionally high (2130 units) due to over-ordering during the unexpected demand drop-off at the end of July (Period 23). Given that the current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 47 periods of demand at the current rate, and the game ends in Period 45, no further orders are required. I will set the parameters to reflect this stabilized off-season demand to prevent the OR backend from triggering any new orders, while maintaining the default lead time which has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its off-season (November), with demand having stabilized at a low baseline. The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P29-P37) is approximately 43.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is exceptionally high (2096 units), which covers approximately 48 periods of current demand levels. Since there are only 7 periods remaining in the simulation (heading towards Period 45) and the holding cost is $1.0 vs. a profit of $4.0, the priority is to avoid any further ordering and deplete the existing stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this stable off-season demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKUs is a 'Womens Swimwear' bottom, currently in the deep off-season (mid-November). The historical data shows a massive peak in mid-summer (P18-P22, mean ~614) followed by a sharp decline starting in Period 23. For the last 10 periods (P29-P38), demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, averaging ~44 units per period. Currently, the system has 2,054 units on-hand with zero in-transit, which covers more than 40 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the massive inventory surplus, no new orders should be placed. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (recent_N=10) to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders, though the 'cap' logic and high on-hand balance will naturally result in zero orders anyway. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory for SKU 599580017 is currently at 2037 units, while the recent demand (P36-P39) has dropped significantly to an average of ~32 units per period. This drastic reduction in demand is consistent with the off-season for swimwear in November. The current on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover over 60 periods of demand at the current rate (2037 / 32 \u2248 63 periods). With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (ending at Period 45) and a lead time of 4 periods, there is no need to place any additional orders. The OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will naturally result in zero orders so long as the base_stock calculated from mu_hat and sigma_hat is lower than the current inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 periods (P29-P39) to reflect the stabilized off-season demand (mean ~41) and minimize any unnecessary base_stock inflation.

Carry-over insight: Off-season demand floor (Nov/Dec) stabilized: P29-P39 mean demand is ~41 units/period, representing the consistent winter baseline for the Womens Swimwear category.

Period 41 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its off-season floor regime (December). Period 40 showed a demand spike to 113, which is likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday outlier rather than a sustained regime shift, given the overall winter context. Mean demand from Period 29 to 40 (off-season) is approximately 50 units. On-hand inventory is 1,924 units with zero in-transit, which is far in excess of the projected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game (ending Period 45). To avoid further holding costs on this massive surplus, I will continue to set parameters that result in zero ordering. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to incorporate the full off-season baseline (approx. 50 units/period) while acknowledging the recent spike, and a recent_N of 12 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its off-season (December). Demand has significantly dropped from the summer peak (avg ~614) to a stabilized winter baseline (avg ~41), though a minor spike to 113 occurred in Period 40 (late November), likely due to Black Friday or holiday travel shopping. Current on-hand inventory is 1,873 units with zero in-transit shipments. Given the current average demand of ~41 units/period, the on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 45 periods of demand, which far exceeds the remaining 4 periods of the game (ending Period 45). Ordering more stock would only increase holding costs without providing additional sales benefit. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 periods (P30-P41) to reflect the current off-season regime, and depend on the OR backend's capped policy to result in zero new orders due to the high on-hand inventory surplus.

Demand has remained consistently low, averaging approximately 45 units per period over the last 14 periods (P29-P42), with occasional small spikes (e.g., P40 demand of 113 possibly due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Current inventory on-hand is 1816 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (total expected demand ~135 units) given the off-season mean. In-transit inventory is 0. Since the on-hand inventory already vastly exceeds any reasonable base stock level (estimated at (1+L)*mu + z*sigma \u2248 5*45 + 1.28*5*20 \u2248 350), the OR backend's capped policy will result in an order of 0 regardless of small parameter adjustments. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect the stable off-season regime established since Period 29. No further orders are needed for the duration of the scenario.

Period 44 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 599580017 (Womens Swimwear). Currently in Period 44 (late December), the product is in its off-season trough. Demand has stabilized at a low baseline: the mean demand for the last 15 periods (P29-P43) is approximately 53 units/period, excluding the P40 outlier which was likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday blip. On-hand inventory is currently 1,758 units, which is significantly above the required base stock for this demand regime. Given the current on-hand levels and the off-season context, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods to represent the current off-season baseline accurately, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. The OR backend will naturally output an order of 0 because on-hand inventory + pipeline far exceeds the computed base stock level.

Period 45 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 599580017 (Womens Swimwear) is currently in its off-season demand floor (late December). The demand has stabilized at a very low level, with a mean of approximately 57 units per period over the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44). The current on-hand inventory is 1701 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the foreseeable future, including the 4-period lead time. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the profit ($4.0/unit), the priority remains to liquidate the existing excess inventory rather than placing new orders. No new orders have been placed since Period 24. For the parameters, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the stable winter demand baseline. This will result in a base stock level much lower than the current inventory, ensuring the OR backend continues to place zero orders (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)).
