At Period 1 (2019/2/25), we are approaching the spring and summer seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically sees a rise in swimwear demand. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples [61, 98, 152, 129, 213] show an upward trend, averaging 130.6. Given the seasonality (approaching March/April), I expect demand to follow the upper end of these samples or even exceed them. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 should arrive in P3. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods) to avoid stockouts. e) Final Order Logic: Estimating demand for P1-P3 at ~150-180 per period to be safe (Total ~450-540). I will place an initial order of 550 to establish inventory and account for the upward seasonal trend and the 2-period lead time delay.",

Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, that Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become available for sale in Period 4. Period 2 and 3 demand will likely result in stockouts until that shipment arrives. My target is to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus safety stock.

June usually sustains this peak or increases as summer holidays approach. (c) Lead-time vs. Missing Orders: Actual lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. The Period 5 order (250 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 10 order (500 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost or significantly delayed. The Period 12 order (450 units) is now 2 periods old and should arrive in P15 or P16. (d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: On-hand is 375. In-transit consists of P10 (500 - likely lost), P12 (450), P14 (400), and the current P15 order. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a projected demand of ~500 units/period, I need ~1500 units in the pipeline.

{
  "rationale": "We are in Period 43 (Dec 16, 2019) out of 45. The product is a 'Timeless Midrise Brief' (Swimwear). Demand has entered its winter low-season, though a brief spike occurred in P40 (113 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday travel shopping. Recent demand for P41 and P42 was 51 and 57 units respectively. With only 3 periods remaining (P43, P44, P45) and 218 units on hand, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover the expected total remaining demand (estimated at ~150-180 units total). The holding cost is $1.0/unit, while profit is $4.0/unit. Ordering more would only increase holding costs and ending inventory penalties without providing any service level benefit, especially given the 2-period lead time which means any order placed now would only arrive in P45 (the final period).",

Period 44 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 44 of a 45-period simulation. The product is women's swimwear, which is in its low season during late December. Recent demand has stabilized around 50-60 units per period (with a temporary spike in P40). With an on-hand inventory of 160 units and only two periods remaining (P44 and P45), the existing stock is more than sufficient to cover the projected remaining demand of approximately 100-120 units. Since the lead time is at minimum 1 period (and historically up to 3), any order placed now would likely not arrive before the simulation concludes. Furthermore, any additional units arriving would only increase ending inventory and incur unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit) without contributing to additional sales profit ($4.0/unit). Therefore, the optimal strategy is to place no further orders.",

Recent demand in December has stabilized between 50-60 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 103 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the demand for this final period (Period 45). Any order placed now would arrive after the simulation ends (minimum lead time is 1-2 periods), resulting in unnecessary holding costs or lost profit on units that cannot be sold within the game timeline. There is also a significant 'In-transit' quantity of 2,800 units, which represents historical lost shipments or late-season orders that are irrelevant for the final decision. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",
