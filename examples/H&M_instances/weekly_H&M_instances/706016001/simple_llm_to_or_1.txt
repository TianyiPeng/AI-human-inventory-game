======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand data for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a recent upward trend with the last five periods recording 694, 576, 685, 715, and 774 units. The average of these periods is approximately 689. Current date 2019/02/11 falls within the pre-spring transition, where demand for basic denim typically remains steady or increases as customers refresh their wardrobes. Given the consistent growth over the last three periods (685 to 715 to 774), there is positive momentum. I will forecast a slight continuation of this trend, albeit conservative to account for potential stabilization after a sharp jump to 774.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data shows a demand range between 576 and 774, with an average of approximately 689 units. In the most recent period (Period 1, 2019/2/11), the observed demand was 671 units, which is consistent with the established baseline. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple wardrobe item that typically experiences steady demand with slight increases during seasonal transitions. Given the current date is mid-February (late winter/early spring transition), demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increasing as consumers update their wardrobes. Based on the consistency between the historical average (689) and the most recent observation (671), I predict demand will settle near the five-period historical mean.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) shows a consistent baseline in the high 600s to low 700s based on the training data ([694, 576, 685, 715, 774]). In the most recent two test periods (Period 1: 671, Period 2: 673), the demand has stabilized with very low variance, indicating a steady state entering late February. Period 3 (2019/2/25) marks the transition into the spring shopping season for denim/trousers. Since the training data showed an upward trajectory reaching 774 and the recent test data is holding steady near its historical mean, I expect a slight uptick as consumer interest in transitional spring clothing increases toward the end of February.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU shows a baseline average of approximately 680-700 units (training data avg: 688). In the test phase, Period 1 (671) and Period 2 (673) aligned with this baseline. Period 3 saw a significant dip to 539 units (-20% from the baseline), likely due to a post-February lull or localized demand variance. However, given that Period 4 (2019-03-04) marks the beginning of March, we typically expect a slight recovery as early spring shopping begins for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', a staple garment. Transitioning into the first full week of March historically stabilizes demand towards the mean before the mid-spring peak. I am forecasting a recovery towards the training mean but staying slightly conservative due to the sharp drop in Period 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) started strong with an average around 680-700 units but has shown a sharp decline over the last two periods. Period 3 dropped to 539 (-20% from Period 2) and Period 4 dropped further to 447 (-17% from Period 3). This suggests a cooling of initial momentum or a transition out of a peak sales phase. The current date (March 11) is post-February transition where spring collections often see initial surges followed by stabilization. Given the consistent downward trajectory over the last two weeks, I expect the demand to continue to soften, though at a slightly decelerated rate as it reaches a baseline for the mid-spring season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1436.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to -1) averaged 688 units. However, recent observed demand shows a distinct downward shift: Periods 1 and 2 averaged 672, but Periods 3, 4, and 5 dropped to 539, 447, and 468 respectively (averaging 485). This suggests a cooling of the initial high demand. Period 6 (March 18) follows the mid-March period; while there is no major global retail event on this specific date, the product (skinny denim) is a staple item and demand appears to be stabilizing in the mid-400s after the initial drop. Logic: Forecast a slight stabilization/minor recovery from the Period 4/5 lows based on the steady demand of Period 5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: Average demand decreased from ~680 to ~485 (-28%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) started high in February (avg ~670) but experienced a significant drop starting in Period 3 (Late Feb/Early March). Currently, the demand has stabilized at a lower level with a slight recovery over the last three periods (447 -> 468 -> 502). The current date is March 25, 2019. In the fashion retail context, late March typically sees a consistent but moderate demand for staple denim items as spring collections settle in. The recent trend shows a growth of roughly 5-7% per period since the trough in Period 4. Given the steady recovery and the absence of immediate major holiday spikes in this specific week, I project a continued slight upward trajectory from the Period 6 value of 502 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim SKU started high (avg ~672 in Periods 1-2) before shifting to a lower regime. The last five periods (Periods 3-7) show a stabilized demand ranging from 447 to 539 units, with the last three periods (502, 511, and the previous 468) showing a slight upward stabilizing trend around the 500-mark. The current date is April 1st; we are entering the Spring season where denim typically maintains steady demand. Given the recent climb from 447 back toward 500+ over the last three periods, a forecast aligned with the recent mean of the current regime (~493 for periods 3-7) is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1048.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 3/4, where demand dropped from the 670s to a lower baseline. However, the last three periods (6, 7, and 8) show a consistent upward trend (502 -> 511 -> 560), suggesting a recovery or a spring seasonal uplift. This aligns with the product being 'superstretch denim' as customers update wardrobes for spring. Period 8 (April 1st) saw a nearly 10% jump from Period 7. Given the current date is April 8th, we anticipate this momentum to continue or stabilize as spring shopping peaks. The forecast assumes a slight continuation of the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend recovery confirmed: Period 6-8 shows consistent growth from 502 to 560 (+11.5%), following the earlier regime drop.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial high demand (avg ~672) which dropped to a lower regime (avg ~485) between periods 3-8. While a recovery trend was noted in Carry-Over Insights, Period 9 (Apr 8) saw a sharp, unexpected decrease to 335 units. This drop likely relates to post-early-spring shifts or specific timing around the Easter season (which occurred Apr 21 in 2019). Given that Period 10 (Apr 15) is the week immediately preceding Easter, a partial recovery from the Period 9 low is expected as shoppers finalize spring holiday outfits, but demand is unlikely to return immediately to the previous 500+ level due to the momentum of the recent drop. I forecast a slight rebound towards the 400-450 range.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant shift in demand patterns for this product (Jade HW Skinny Denim). After an initial drop in Period 3, there was a recovery attempt between Periods 6-8 (growing from 502 to 560). However, the last two periods (9 and 10) have seen a sharp downturn to 335 and 269 units respectively. The current date (April 22, 2019) coincides with the week following Easter Monday, a period where retail demand often softens after holiday shopping. Given the product is a staple item ('Divided Collection' skinny jeans), the recent drop likely represents a new lower-demand regime or a seasonal lull. Period 10's 269 units represents a ~20% drop from Period 9, following a ~40% drop from Period 8. I will forecast a slight stabilization at a lower level, as the sharpest part of the decline usually levels off before a potential rebound.

Carry-over insight: New downward demand regime confirmed: Period 9-10 average dropped to ~302, a 46% decrease from the Period 8 peak (560), reversing the previous upward trend recovery.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial high demand (avg ~670) that dropped to a mid-level regime (avg ~485), recovered slightly, and then entered a significant downward regime starting Period 9. Specifically, demand plummeted from 560 (Period 8) to 335 (Period 9), and has since stabilized at a much lower level: 269 (Period 10) and 261 (Period 11). The current date is April 29, 2019. While late April/early May often sees slight spring retail activity, the recent 3-period trend for this specific SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a heavy contraction, likely reflecting a shift in consumer preference or the end of a specific promotion. Demand has stabilized in the 260s range over the last two weeks. I forecast a slight stabilization/minor recovery around the current average of the low regime, as the rate of decline has slowed significantly.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a distinct period of decline from an initial average of ~670 down to ~480, followed by a brief recovery peak at Period 8 (560). A significant downward regime shift occurred at Period 9, with demand dropping into the 200-300 range. Specifically, Periods 10 and 11 averaged 265 units. Period 12 (April 29) shows a slight uptick to 339 units (+30% from the previous week), likely due to early May seasonality/payday effects or a minor correction to the recent sharp drop. Given the current date (May 6), we are moving into late spring. Recent history (Periods 10-12) suggests a new stabilized range. I expect demand to remain relatively consistent with the most recent observation, potentially stabilizing slightly lower as the immediate end-of-month bump fades, but staying above the 260 floor.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has entered a significantly lower regime compared to the start of the year. Following the downward shift identified in Period 11, demand has fluctuated between 241 and 339 units. (1) Historical summary: Period 1-8 averaged ~550 units, but Period 9 saw a sharp drop. (2) Recent trend: The average for the last five periods (P9-P13) is approximately 289. Specifically, the last three periods show high volatility (261, 339, 241). (3) Seasonal context: As of mid-May, demand for 'washed superstretch denim' may be slightly softening as consumer interest shifts toward summer apparel. (4) Forecast logic: Given the drop in P13 to 241 (the series low), the forecast anticipates a slight mean reversion within the current lower regime, targeting the 250-280 range.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows multiple downward shifts. After a peak in Period 8 (560), the demand entered a lower regime. Most recently, from Period 12 to 14, demand has sharply declined from 339 to 241 to 189 units. Seasonally, late May (Period 15) in the Northern Hemisphere typically sees a reduction in demand for heavy denim 'superstretch' skinny jeans as consumers transition to summer-appropriate apparel. The recent trend shows a weekly decline of approximately 21% from Period 13 to 14. For Period 15, I expect the demand to continue this downward trajectory, though potentially stabilizing near a seasonal floor.

Carry-over insight: Continued demand deterioration: Periods 13-14 show a further significant drop from the Period 9-11 average of ~288 to an average of 215, marking a 25% decline as the product enters the summer season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a long-term downward trend, characterized by several regime shifts. The most recent 'Carry-over Insight' noted a drop to an average of ~215 for Periods 13-14. However, Period 15 saw a sharp, unexpected spike to 375 units (a 98% increase over Period 14). This spike occurs in late May, potentially corresponding to a pre-summer promotional event or a seasonal shift in purchasing behavior for denim basics. Given that Period 12 also showed a temporary spike (339) followed by a sharp drop (241), I expect high volatility. The forecast for Period 16 assumes that while the trend is generally downward, the recent momentum from Period 15 will lead to a moderate correction rather than an immediate return to sub-200 levels. I am forecasting a slight mean reversion while acknowledging the recent spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product has shown two major regime shifts, recently stabilizing at a lower base (avg ~215 in Periods 13-14) before a sudden, sharp spike in Periods 15 (375) and 16 (533). This recent spike (Period 16 saw 533 units) likely correlates with early June shopping trends or a promotional event for 'Divided' collection denim. As the current date is June 3rd, we are entering the peak early-summer shopping season. While the growth from 375 to 533 is aggressive, demand for skinny jeans often plateaus or slightly corrects after a massive 42% week-over-week jump. I expect demand to remain very high relative to the May lows but show a slight stabilization as the initial surge peaks.

Carry-over insight: Strong recovery trend confirmed (Periods 15-16): Demand surged from 189 to 533 (+182%), signaling a new high-demand regime for early June, reversing the previous downward trend noted in Period 15.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown high volatility. After a significant slump in May (P13-14), demand surged in late May and early June (P15-16), peaking at 533 units. Period 17 (June 3) shows a slight correction to 451 units. Given the product information (high-waisted jeans), this item often sees increased traction during transitional weather and early summer shopping periods. The recent trend (P15-17) establishes a new high-demand regime with an average of approximately 453 units. As we move further into June, I anticipate a minor stabilization or slight cooling from the peak, following the downward movement from P16 to P17. Based on the 3-period moving average and the recent downward step from the peak, the forecast for Period 18 is set slightly below the Period 17 level.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a highly volatile pattern with a recent strong recovery. After hitting a low of 189 in Period 14, demand surged to 533 (Period 16) and has since stabilized in the 450-465 range over the last two weeks (Period 17: 451, Period 18: 462). This suggests a stabilization in a higher demand regime compared to the April/May slump. The product is a staple item (High-waisted skinny jeans), which typically maintains consistent demand in early summer. Given the stability of the last two periods, I expect demand for Period 19 to remain close to the recent mean of 456, with a slight upward bias following the week-over-week increase from Period 17 to 18.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization in high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 17-18 show consistent demand averaging 456 units, maintaining the recovery gains from Period 16.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU has been volatile. After a strong recovery in late May/early June (Periods 16-18) where demand averaged ~482 units, the most recent observation (Period 19) shows a significant drop to 358 units (-22%). This decline coincides with the late June period (6/17-6/24), which historically can see reduced full-price demand before mid-summer sales or due to shifting seasonal preferences away from 'Skinny Denim' as temperatures peak. The 358 figure aligns more closely with the levels seen in late April (Period 9-12). Given the sharp drop in Period 19, the forecast anticipates a slight further softening or stabilization at this lower level as the product moves deeper into the summer lull.

Carry-over insight: End of high-demand plateau: Period 19 shows a 22% drop (from ~462 to 358) from the previous three-period average, ending the high-demand regime identified in Period 17/19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim SKU has shown high volatility with distinct regimes. After a significant recovery in June (averaging ~460 in Periods 16-18), demand has entered a sharp downward trajectory over the last two weeks (358 in Period 19, 265 in Period 20), representing a 42% decline from the June peak. This decline aligns with the 'End of high-demand plateau' noted in the Period 20 insight. Given the current date is July 1st, we are entering the peak summer season where demand for 'high-waisted superstretch denim' typically softens further in favor of lighter seasonal wear. The momentum is strongly downward, and the transition from June to July often sees a continued clearing of spring/early summer styles. I expect demand to continue its descent, likely stabilizing near the previous low-regime floor seen in Period 14 (~190-250 range).

Carry-over insight: New downward regime confirmed (Periods 19-20): Demand dropped from a high-demand plateau of ~460 to an average of 311 (-32%), signaling seasonal cooling as the product enters July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a downward seasonal trend following its late May/early June peak. Historically, demand for this product has shown significant volatility. After a high-demand plateau in Periods 17-18 averaging 456 units, demand dropped significantly. Period 19 was 358, Period 20 was 265, and Period 21 showed a slight corrective bounce to 353. The average of the last three periods (19-21) is 325 units. Given that we are now in early July (2019/7/8), a peak summer period, heavy denim products generally experience steady or declining demand as consumers shift to lighter clothing. The recent bounce to 353 appears to be a minor fluctuation within a broader downward regime compared to the June highs. I expect a slight normalization toward the 300-330 range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a sequence of regime shifts. After the Period 19-20 drop (averaging ~311), the last two periods (21-22) have shown a clear upward momentum from 353 to 393 (+11.3%). Calendar-wise, we are in mid-July (2019/7/15), a period often associated with 'Back to School' preparation or mid-summer promotions for staple denim products like high-waisted skinny jeans. Period 22 demand (393) is the highest since Period 18, suggesting a reversal of the early July cooling. The forecast logic anticipates this upward momentum to continue slightly or stabilize as demand recovers from the late-June/early-July lull.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward momentum (Period 21-22): Demand increased from the Period 20 low (265) back to an average of 373, an increase of 40%, potentially signaling the start of a late-summer/pre-fall recovery.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a recovery from the Period 20 low (265) to a new stabilization range in Periods 21-23. The average demand over the last three periods (353, 393, 369) is approximately 372 units. The product type (high-waisted skinny denim) typically sees stable demand during the transition from late summer to pre-fall collections in late July. Period 23 (369) shows a slight 6% cooling from Period 22 (393), suggesting the recent upward momentum is plateuing into a stable mid-range regime. Given the consistent performance between 350-400 over the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain within this range for Period 24.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product (SKU 706016001) shows significant volatility with periodic peaks and troughs. Recent analysis shows a recovery trend in early July (Periods 21-23) averaging 372 units. However, Period 24 (July 22nd) saw a sharp decline to 232 units. This late-July drop (Period 24) aligns with typical retail patterns where summer clearance ends and demand dips before the 'Back to School' peak in August. Given the current date (July 29th), we are at the tail end of July. While Period 24 was low, we expect a slight stabilization or very early precursors of August demand, though likely staying below the mid-July peak. The forecast weights the recent drop heavily but allows for a minor correction back toward the recent average as the month transitions.

Carry-over insight: End of late-summer recovery: Demand in Period 24 dropped 37% from the Period 21-23 average (372 to 232), signaling a temporary seasonal low before the August period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows high volatility with distinct regime shifts. Recent data shows a significant drop in Period 24 (232 units) from a previous average of ~370, followed by a slight recovery in Period 25 (298 units). Calendar analysis for Period 26 (August 5-11, 2019) suggests the start of the 'Back-to-School' shopping season, which typically drives demand for staple items like high-waisted skinny jeans. Historically, the product has shown strong recovery momentum after dips (e.g., Period 15, Period 21). Given the current upward movement from the Period 24 low and the seasonal timing, I expect a moderate increase as the market transitions into August demand patterns.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product shows high volatility with clear seasonal peaks. Previous carry-over insights identified a drop in late July (Period 24, 232 units), followed by a recovery phase. The recent demand (Periods 25-26) has increased from 298 to 381 (+27.8%), marking two consecutive periods of growth. Looking at the current date (August 12, 2019), we are in the peak 'Back-to-School' shopping window for denim. This specific product\u2014high-waisted skinny jeans from the Divided (youth) collection\u2014is highly sensitive to this season. The historical trend from Periods 21-23 (avg ~372) and the current climb to 381 suggest a sustained upward movement. I expect demand to continue increasing into mid-August as school sessions approach.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand recovery confirmed (Periods 25-26): Demand increased from a July low of 232 to 381 (+64% cumulative over two weeks), signaling the start of the autumn denim peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is currently experiencing a strong 'Back-to-School' (BTS) recovery trend. Historical demand shows a consistent upward trajectory over the last three periods: 298 (P25), 381 (P26), and 493 (P27), representing a 65% increase since late July. The current date (August 19) aligns with the peak of BTS shopping in many regions, where denim demand typically surges. Period 27's demand (493) has now surpassed the high-demand plateau seen in early June (~456), confirming a significant upward trend. Given the momentum (+29% in the most recent week), I expect a further increase as we reach the end of August, though the rate of growth may begin to moderate slightly as the initial BTS rush peaks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn denim peak confirmed: Demand has increased for 3 consecutive periods (P25-27), rising from 298 to 493 (+65%), confirming a sustained Back-to-School recovery and early autumn regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a confirmed autumn recovery period, traditionally driven by Back-to-School shopping in August. Historical demand shows a significant upward trajectory from Period 25 (298 units) to a peak in Period 27 (493 units). Period 28 (432 units) shows a slight cooling from the peak but remains significantly higher (+45%) than the late-July low (232). As we enter Period 29 (August 26th), we are in the final peak week of Back-to-School shopping in many regions. Given the established 'Autumn denim peak' confirmed in the carry-over insights and the slight week-over-week drop in Period 28, I expect demand to stabilize or slightly rebound as the final Labor Day/School start push occurs. I am forecasting a slight increase from P28 while remaining below the P27 peak, following the volatility seen in previous regime shifts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong Back-to-School/Early Autumn recovery starting in Period 25, peaking at Period 27 (493 units). Since then, demand has entered a slight cooling phase (432 in P28, 396 in P29), consistent with the transition from immediate Back-to-School shopping to steady early September consumption. For Period 30 (2019/09/02), which coincides with Labor Day in many markets, demand for staple items like 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' typically experiences a minor uptick or stabilizes compared to the late August dip, as customers finalize autumn wardrobes. The average demand of the last three periods is ~440. Given the slight downward trend over the last two weeks, I expect demand to stabilize around the 400-unit level as the seasonal peak plateaus.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge in Period 30 (740 units), which is a 87% increase from Period 29 (396 units). This spike coincides with the start of September, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' peaks and the seasonal transition to autumn denim. Recent movement shows high volatility: Periods 27-29 averaged ~440 units, but Period 30 suggests a breakout into a higher regime. Historically, the periods following a sharp peak often experience a slight correction/mean reversion or a plateau. Given that early September is a peak time for jeans, demand is expected to remain high but potentially lower than the immediate spike of P30 as the initial shopping rush settles.

Carry-over insight: September demand peak confirmed: Period 30 showed a record high demand of 740 (+87% vs previous week), far exceeding the Back-to-School recovery established in August (avg ~435), marking a new seasonal high-demand regime for the product category.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim SKU shows a significant seasonal peak in early September, identified in Carry-over insights as a record high regime. Period 30 (740) and Period 31 (708) represent the peak of the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn transition. The product is a 'High-waisted skinny denim TRS', which is a staple for autumn wardrobes. Analyzing the recent trend, there is a slight decrease from Period 30 to 31 (-4%), suggesting the absolute peak has likely passed, but demand remains in a high regime significantly above the August average (~435). As we move further into mid-September (Period 32), demand is expected to consolidate further but remain elevated before the next major seasonal shift. I forecast a slight normalization while staying within the high-demand band established in the last two weeks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift that began in Period 30 (September 2nd), with demand jumping from a previous average of ~435 to a record high plateau exceeding 700. For the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has been exceptionally stable at high levels: 740, 708, and 707 units. This indicates a sustained high-demand regime for skinny denim during the peak September autumn season, likely driven by transitional weather and continued seasonal shopping momentum. Given the minimal variance between P31 and P32 (708 vs 707), I expect demand to remain stabilized in this high-demand plateau for the current period (September 23rd) before entering the October cooling period.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized high-demand plateau confirmed: Period 30-32 show consistent demand averaging 718 units (\xb12%), maintaining the peak regime established at the start of September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a massive high-demand regime in September. While Periods 30-32 showed a stabilized high-demand plateau near ~718 units, Period 33 (2019/9/23) saw a dramatic spike to 1428 units, a 100% increase over the previous three-period average. This surge coincides with late September, often characterized by pay-day cycles and the peak transition into autumn wardrobes. For the current period (2019/9/30), we are at the intersection of the end of the month and the deepening of the fall season. While 1428 units might represent a peak/promotion spike, the overall trend is exceptionally strong. I expect a partial correction from the massive P33 outlier while maintaining a much higher level than the previous 700-unit plateau.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand breakout Period 33: Demand doubled from 707 to 1428 (+102%) compared to the previous plateau, signaling an extreme seasonal peak or promotional lift at the end of September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim has entered a high-demand autumn regime. Recent performance shows a stable baseline of approximately 710-740 units (P30-P32). Although Period 33 experienced a sharp spike to 1428 (likely a specific promotion), Period 34 demand (748) demonstrates a return to the established high-demand plateau. For early October (Period 35), I expect demand to remain stable within this established seasonal regime, mirroring the baseline observed over the last month excluding the outlier.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a high-demand regime throughout September, maintaining a plateau of ~725 units (P30-P32, P34), with a significant outlier in P33 (1428). However, Period 35 (606 units) reflects a 19% decrease from Period 34, signaling the cooling of the initial autumn/back-to-school peak as we move into mid-October. Given this downward shift from the September high, I anticipate demand will continue to soften slightly or stabilize at a lower autumn baseline. Based on the 606 level and the trajectory from the plateau, a forecast in the mid-500s reflects the current seasonal cooling.

Carry-over insight: End of September high-demand plateau: Period 35 demand (606) dropped 19% below the previous 700-750 unit regime, indicating a seasonal cooling following the autumn peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a clear transition from the exceptionally high September peak (averaging ~720-750 units, with a 1428 outlier) to a lower October regime. The demand in Period 35 (606) and Period 36 (581) indicates a stabilization following the end of the September high-demand plateau identified in the carry-over insights. Historically, this skinny denim product experiences cooling as it enters late October, moving away from the peak Back-to-School and early Autumn buying cycles. The 4% decline between Period 35 and 36 suggests a gradual tapering rather than a crash. Given the current date (Oct 21), I expect demand to follow this mild downward trajectory as the market moves toward November, settling slightly below the previous week's level.

Carry-over insight: New stabilized October regime confirmed: Periods 35-36 show demand settling at an average of 594, a ~20% decline from the September plateau (~740) excluding the outlier.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the product is in a stabilized October regime following its September peak. After the outlier in Period 33 (1428 units), demand normalized to an average of ~593 units in Periods 35-36. Period 37 (Oct 21) showed a moderate increase to 643 units (+10% vs P36). The current date is October 28, moving into the end of the month and approaching the November transition. High-waisted denim for the 'Divided' collection typically maintains steady demand in late autumn as consumers prep for colder weather but hasn't yet reached the holiday/Black Friday surge (usually late Nov). Given the slight uptick in the most recent period (643) against the 3-period average of 610, I expect demand to remain stable within the 600-650 range, mirroring the resilience seen in the previous week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a stabilized mid-autumn regime. Following the September peak (~718 avg) and the subsequent cooling in early October (Periods 35-36 avg ~594), the last two periods (37-38) show a steady upward trend from 643 to 663. As of the current date, November 4th, we are entering the pre-holiday shopping window. Historically, denim trousers see sustained interest as temperatures drop in early November, often acting as a daily staple before the peak holiday rush. Given the 3.1% increase in the most recent period and the transition into a typically higher-demand retail month (November), I expect a continued modest increase in demand following the current trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn recovery trend: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P36-P38) from 581 to 663 (+14%), establishing a new support level above the early October cooling phase.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant drop in Period 39 (485 units), down 27% from the Period 38 peak (663). This decline broke the 'Late Autumn recovery trend' identified in previous carry-over insights. However, the current period (Period 40) coincides with the week of November 11th (Singles' Day), a major retail event. In previous high-demand periods (e.g., September), we saw significant breakouts followed by corrections. The drop in Period 39 likely represents a pre-promotion lull where consumers defer purchases until sales start. I anticipate a rebound in Period 40 as demand recovers toward the established October/November support level of approximately 600-650 units, driven by promotional activity around the 11/11 date.

The average of the last two periods (533) is lower than the October plateau, indicating a cooling trend in early November. However, as the calendar moves into the week of November 18th (Period 41), demand is expected to see a slight uptick in anticipation of the pre-Black Friday shopping period, continuing the recovery seen from P39 to P40. The forecast builds on the P40 momentum while remaining conservative relative to the September peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the product settled into a November baseline of approximately 540-580 units (P40: 581, P41: 547) after cooling from its September peak. Period 42 (starting 2019/11/25) coincides with Black Friday week, which is typically the highest-volume retail event of the year. Looking at previous demand spikes for this SKU, major events like the September peak (P33) saw demand double compared to the immediate prior plateau. Given the current baseline of ~550, and the high seasonal relevance of denim during winter holiday sales, I anticipate a significant surge for Black Friday, though potentially tempered by the overall lower baseline in November compared to September. I am forecasting a nearly 75-80% increase from the previous week's volume.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 (Nov 25) reached an extraordinary peak of 3,100 units, which coincides with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. This spike represents a massive outlier (+466% vs the previous 3-period average) compared to the 'Late Autumn recovery' regime identified in Period 39 (avg ~537 units). Historical patterns show that such extreme peaks are immediately followed by a \u2018mean reversion\u2019 or a post-promotion dip as consumer demand is pulled forward. Given the date is Dec 2, we are entering the post-Cyber Monday cooling period. While holiday shopping remains active, demand is expected to drop significantly from the promotional high of 3,100 back towards the established November baseline (avg ~540). I will forecast a value slightly lower than the pre-promotion average to account for the typical post-Black Friday exhaustion before December holiday shopping picks up again.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak confirmed: Period 42 showed a nearly 6x increase in demand compared to the November baseline (537 to 3100), marking the highest observed peak in the product's history.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has settled following the extreme Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak of 3100 in Period 42. Period 43 demand (674) represents a return to a high-baseline regime, very similar to the late October levels (Periods 37-38 averaged ~653). Historically, the second week of December (Period 44) remains elevated compared to November baselines due to holiday shopping and shipping deadlines, but usually sees a slight cooling from the immediate post-Cyber Monday rush. I expect demand to stabilize around the high-600s mark, consistent with the pre-peak support levels observed in October.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization: Period 43 confirms a return to the late Autumn high-demand baseline (~650-700 units) rather than the lower November baseline (~540), indicating a sustained December holiday lift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand analysis shows that following the Black Friday peak (Period 42: 3100 units), demand stabilized in a high-demand holiday regime during Periods 43 and 44 with an average of 677 units (674 and 680 respectively). This confirms the 'Post-Black Friday stabilization' insight, placing current demand significantly higher than the November baseline (~540). Period 45 (2019/12/16) covers the final full week of shopping before Christmas. Given the product is a staple denim item, this period typically sees a surge due to 'Super Saturday' and final holiday preparations. Current momentum is slightly positive (increase from 674 to 680), and seasonal logic suggests a further uptick as we enter the peak of the December holiday lift before the anticipated post-holiday slowdown in late December.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak momentum confirmed: Demand in the two weeks following Black Friday (P43-P44) has stabilized at ~677 units, which is 25% higher than the early November baseline, establishing a clear December holiday support level.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a current stabilized holiday regime for Period 43-45 (average ~670 units), which follows the Black Friday peak and sits higher than the early November baseline (~540 units). The current period (Period 46) covers 2019/12/23, representing the week of Christmas. Looking at the product type (skinny denim), demand typically remains firm through the Christmas week but can begin a slight decline toward the end of the year as the peak gift-buying season concludes and inventory shifts towards post-holiday sales. Given the high stability of the last three periods (674, 680, 657), I expect demand to remain within this high-support range but show a minor seasonal tapering as shopping intensity slightly shifts past the pre-Christmas rush.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the Black Friday peak, demand stabilized at a holiday support level of ~670 units (Periods 43-45). Current Period 46 (Christmas week, Dec 23) showed a sharp 27% decline to 475 units, which is a common seasonal phenomenon for the retail holiday lull. Period 47 (New Year week starting Dec 30) typically experiences a partial recovery from the Christmas trough due to post-holiday sales and 'New Year, New Me' shopping behaviors, though demand generally remains below the peak December gift-giving levels. I expect demand to rebound from the Period 46 low but remain lower than the early December baseline of 670 units.
