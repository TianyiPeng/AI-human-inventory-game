The OR recommendation of 491 is based on a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage) and likely overestimates demand by including the high initial historical samples. 4.

This consists of P8 (630 units - Lost), and orders from P10-P13. Wait, P10-P13 orders were 0. The 1,412 units must be the sum of P8 (630) and something else. Checking history: P8=630, P9=500 (arrived), P10=0, P11=0, P12=0. The math indicates the 1,412 units in-transit is likely P8(630) + P3(782) = 1,412. Both of these are lost.

Wait, looking at the history: P8 order (630) is missing, P14 order (380) is pending, and P15 order (350) arrived in P16.

However, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is ~335. Lead Time: Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Although Period 16 and 17 showed a slight rebound (533 and 451), the overall trend remains lower than the start.

The OR recommendation is 0 because it counts all in-transit units as valid pipeline.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P16-P18) has recovered to an average of ~482 units, significantly higher than the P12-P15 trough (~236 units), though lower than the initial historical baseline (~690). Product context (High-waisted superstretch denim) suggests consistent year-round relevance, but the current date (mid-June) precedes the late summer back-to-school ramp-up. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 2,242 units (including the likely lost P3 order of 782 and potentially delayed P8 order of 630). Even if we treat the P3 and P8 orders as lost (total 1,412 units), the remaining pipeline (P14, P15, P18) totals 830 units. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because the total in-transit quantity (2,242) exceeds the base-stock level calculated from historical demand. However, with 0 on-hand and high uncertainty regarding the older in-transit shipments, there is a risk of stockouts if P14 or P18 are delayed.

While the 'In-transit' figure shows 5,642 units, a detailed audit of the history reveals that approximately 4,000 of those units are from orders placed between Period 3 and Period 22 (P3, P8, P14, P22) and are almost certainly lost given they are 10+ periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2.

The P32 order (800 units) is currently 3 periods old and overdue, potentially lost or significantly delayed. The OR recommendation of 0 is rejected because its 'base_stock' calculation is being misled by the 'In-transit' count of lost shipments, erroneously assuming we are overstocked.

Lost Orders: As confirmed in Carry-over Insights, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (approx. 4,842 units from P3, P8, P14, P22, P32, P34) is likely lost and should be discounted. 4. Effective Pipeline: The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P40 (400 units) and P41 (600 units). The P40 order is expected to arrive in P42 or P43. 5. Inventory Position: Current on-hand is 253. Total effective inventory (On-hand 253 + Reliable Pipeline 1000) = 1,253 units. Given an average demand of ~540, this covers approximately 2.3 periods. 6. Strategy: To maintain a safety buffer and cover the lead-time interval (L+1 = 3 periods), we need approximately 1,620 units (540 * 3). The current effective inventory is 1,253. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the nearly 5,000 'ghost' units in its pipeline calculation. I will override the OR and order 400 units to reach the target coverage.",

Current on-hand inventory is 0. The OR recommendation is 0, which is extremely dangerous given the recent stockout and the high demand regime. While the 'In-transit' figure is high (6,242 units), our historical analysis confirms that approximately 4,842 units of that pipeline are lost shipments (from Periods 3, 8, 14, 22, 32, and 34). The remaining 'live' pipeline consists of orders from P40 (400), P41 (600), and P42 (400), totaling 1,400 units. Given the high demand observed in the previous period and the likelihood of sustained elevated demand through the early December holiday shopping season, the current reliable pipeline is insufficient.

Demand Analysis: We are currently in the post-Black Friday (P42) period. Demand in P43 dropped from 3,100 to 674. Given the product is superstretch denim (a staple), demand is expected to remain relatively high but stable (~600-700 units) heading into the holiday season. Strategy: The OR baseline recommends 0 because it sees the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Since we expect ~650 demand per period and lead time is roughly 2-3 periods, we need a base stock of ~1,950-2,600 units to cover the lead time plus current period.

The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P42 (400 units) and P44 (600 units), totaling 1,000 units. Demand Analysis: We are currently in the pre-Christmas week (Dec 16). Following the Black Friday spike (3,100), demand has stabilized at ~680 units (P43-P44). Given the holiday season, I expect demand to remain at or slightly above this level for the next 1-2 weeks. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it factors in the massive 5,842 in-transit figure. However, accounting for lost shipments, the 'effective' total inventory (920 on-hand + 1,000 reliable pipeline) is 1,920 units. With an expected demand of ~700-750 units per period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, 1,920 units barely covers the next 2.5 periods.

Demand Analysis: We are currently in the Christmas/Holiday peak (Dec 23). Recent demand (P43-P45) has stabilized at ~670 units per period following the Black Friday spike. However, demand usually drops significantly immediately after Christmas. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it incorrectly perceives a massive pipeline (5,942 units).

The 'In-transit' figure of 5,842 units is heavily skewed by systemic pipeline losses (P3, P8, P14, P22, P32, P34) totaling 4,842 units, as established in the Period 40 insight. The reliable pipeline consists only of the P44 order (600 units) and the P46 order (400 units). Demand Analysis: We are currently in the post-holiday/end-of-year period. Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 3,100) and the early December stabilization (P43-P45: ~670), demand softened significantly in Period 46 (475 units). Given the date (Dec 30), we should expect demand to either stabilize at this lower level or decrease slightly as the holiday season ends. Lead-time Inference: Actual lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Strategy: The OR baseline recommends 0 units, likely because it sees the high on-hand (688) and doesn't account for the lost pipeline. However, with 688 on hand and expected demand around 450-500, we have sufficient stock for the immediate period. The P44 order (600 units) is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods.
