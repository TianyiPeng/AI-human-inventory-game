Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser (SKU 706016001), a staple item. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. The mean demand is approximately 688.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of 72.8. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the full history provided) to capture the current demand level. For L, I will use 'default' (2 periods). The mu_hat calculation by the backend for recent_N=5 will be (1+2) * 688.8 = 2066.4, and sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+2) * 72.8 = 126.1. This provides coverage for the review period plus the lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2 for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in Period 1) is still in transit, adhering to the promised lead time of 2 periods. The historical demand sequence [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671] shows a stable mean around 686. Since the product is a staple denim item in mid-February, there is no immediate seasonal spike expected before the spring transition. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) to capture the current stable regime. The lead time is set to default as we have no 'conclude' messages indicating a shift from the promised 2 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 2058 units) minus current pipeline inventory (808).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Current historical demands: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673]. The demand is relatively stable around a mean of ~670-700. In Period 2, we observed an arrival from Period 1 with a lead time of 1 period, which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand is 135 and there is a pipeline of 804 (ordered in P2, expected in P3 or P4). Since the actual lead time was observed as 1 in the most recent 'conclude' message, I will set L=1. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (774, 671, 673, and the two pre-history values 685, 715) show a consistent mean around 700. I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current stable regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 4, early March. The product is a staple denim item. Recent demand shows a slight downward trend (539 units in Period 3 vs. an average of ~680 earlier). Current on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we are currently stocked out at the start of the period. However, 1324 units are in transit. The Period 1 order (808 units) arrived in Period 2 (actual lead time = 1). The Period 2 order (804 units) did not arrive in Period 3, suggesting its actual lead time will be at least 2. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed LT=1 with the promised LT=2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the slight downward shift in demand (674 average over the last 5 periods) while still weighting the pre-game stability. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the 2nd period of lead time and the current stock-out situation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game) shows [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] and the game history shows [671, 673, 539, 447]. The mean demand is approximately 622 units/period. However, we see a downward trend in the last two periods (539 and 447), which might reflect a post-February lull or a shift in the 'Divided' collection demand. Inventory status: 357 on-hand + 648 in-transit (P3: 520, P4: 128). Regarding lead time: P1 order arrived in P2 (L=1), P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). The promised lead time is 2. The P3 order (520 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (L=2). To ensure we cover demand during the review + lead time (1+2=3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~600 units, which is safer than the long-term average given the recent dips. Sigma is set to default to handle variability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Historical demand for the last 10 periods (including pre-game) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447, 468]. There is a noticeable downward trend in demand starting around Period 3/4, dropping from a ~700 average to ~480. N=3 is selected for mu_hat to capture this recent regime shift (average of last 3 is 484.6). Observed lead times are: P1->P2 (1), P2->P4 (2), P4->P5 (1). The average observed lead time is 1.33 periods. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is consistently 1 or 2. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the average of observed lead times. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the volatility during this transition period. Current on-hand is low (17), but there are 1308 units in-transit (orders from P3 and P5), which should cover the pipeline. Setting mu_hat to recent_N will prevent over-ordering as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: average demand decreased from ~700 to ~485 (-30%); Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods (average 1.33).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Demand analysis: Initial demand (P1-P2) averaged ~672. Starting P3, demand shifted significantly lower, averaging ~489 (P3-P6). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime (approx 489 units/period). Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are 1, 2, and 1 periods (Avg = 1.33). The order from P3 (520 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and has not arrived; combined with the fact that the P4 order already arrived (P5), the P3 order is highly likely lost. Inventory status: On-hand is 0, and we have 1308 units in-transit (P5 order of 788 and P6 order of 520, which was actually 0 units, so just the P5 order + the potentially lost P3 order). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 'ghost' P3 inventory in-transit, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat based on the recent lower demand regime to avoid overstocking while we wait for the P5 shipment to arrive (expected in P7 or P8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~670 to ~490 starting Period 3. Shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is likely lost (overdue by 2 periods while later shipments arrived).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-2 averaged ~672 units, while Period 3-7 have averaged ~493 units (a ~27% decrease). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this lower demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2. Historically, we've seen LT=1 (P1, P4) and LT=2 (P2, P5). However, the shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is now 3 periods overdue (it should have arrived by P5 or P6), which strongly suggests it is lost. The shipment from Period 7 (218 units) is currently in-transit. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the historical average while I monitor the pipeline for further losses. The current on-hand of 277 units plus the 218 in-transit (excluding the likely lost 520) puts us in a reasonable position, but mu_hat must reflect the recent lower demand to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (520 units) confirmed lost: overdue by 3 periods (since Period 6) while Period 4 and Period 5 orders have already arrived.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 9 (2019/4/8). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Demand analysis: Initial demand (P1-P2) averaged ~670. A regime shift occurred from P3 onwards, with demand stabilizing at a lower mean of ~500 (P3-P8 average is 511). Most recent demand (P8) was 560. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 753 (consisting of P3: 520, P7: 218, P8: 15). Lead Time Analysis: Promised L=2. Observed actuals: P1 arrived in 1, P2 in 2, P4 in 1, P5 in 2. Crucially, the P3 order (520 units) is now 5 periods overdue (promised 2) while later orders (P4, P5) have arrived; this shipment is confirmed lost. Because the OR backend includes 'in-transit' in its base-stock calculation but doesn't know P3 is lost, it will under-order. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock by roughly the amount of the lost shipment (520 units) to force an order, while setting L to 2 to reflect the physical reality of successful shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 10 (April 15). Demand context: A significant drop was observed in Period 9 (335 units) compared to the Period 3-8 average (~505 units). This may signal a seasonal shift as spring progresses, though we remain cautious. Inventory Reconciliation: On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 1506 units; however, the shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is confirmed lost (overdue by 5 periods), and the shipment from Period 7 (218 units) is now at the limit of its promised lead time (L=2). Parameter Strategy: The OR backend is unaware of the 520-unit loss and includes it in 'pipeline_inventory'. To compensate for this 520-unit 'phantom' inventory and prevent under-ordering, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean (N=7, avg=480) for (1+L=3) periods (480 * 3 = 1440) and then add 520 units to offset the lost shipment (1440 + 520 = 1960). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect current volatility. L is kept at default (2) as recent deliveries (P4, P5) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand drop in P9 (335) suggests a potential seasonal regime shift from the previous average of ~505; Shipment from P3 (520 units) remains lost and must be offset in base stock calculations.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), we observe a significant demand drop over the last two periods (335 and 269), down from a previous average of ~505. This suggests a seasonal shift as we move further into spring. Additionally, the shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. The shipment from Period 8 (15 units) is also overdue (promised L=2, now at 3), though recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~1.8). Total pipeline inventory is 1852 (comprising P3: 520, P8: 15, P9: 753, P10: 564). Because the OR backend assumes the pipeline is valid, the 520 lost units from P3 create a 'phantom' inventory that prevents necessary ordering. To correct this, I am setting an explicit 'mu_hat' that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage (approx 3 * 300 = 900) plus the 520 unit deficit, totaling 1420. This forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom P3 units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the increasing variability in delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~505 to ~300 (-40%), likely seasonal. Lead time variability increasing (observed 1, 2, 1, 2, 3).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are managing SKU 706016001. A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 9, with average demand dropping from ~500 to ~288 (mean of last three periods: 335, 269, 261), likely due to post-Easter seasonality for denim trousers. The shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is now 9 periods overdue and must be considered lost; however, the pipeline inventory still includes it. Current on-hand is 492. In-transit is 1099 (520 from P3, 15 from P8, 564 from P10). Since the P3 units are lost, effective pipeline is only 579. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 'ghost' P3 inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Lead times have been volatile (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2), averaging 1.83. I will use L=2 (promised) and forecast demand for (L+1)=3 periods. Using the recent mean (~288) * 3 = 864. To account for the 520 lost units, I will set mu_hat to 864 + 520 = 1384. This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) correctly triggers an order despite the 520 units that will never arrive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 9 (averaging ~301 units, a ~40% drop from the previous ~546). Current on-hand is 717, which covers over two periods of the current demand. However, there is a critical inventory accounting issue: the pipeline inventory shows 535 units, of which 520 units (from Period 3) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' 535 from its base stock calculation, which would result in under-ordering. To compensate for this 535-unit deficit in the pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Current mean (recent_4) = 301. With L=2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+2)*301 = 903. To offset the lost 535 units, I set mu_hat to 903 + 535 = 1438. This ensures the base stock target is high enough to ignore the lost units. I use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of the new regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand (Period 9-13) has stabilized at a lower regime, averaging 289 units/period, down from the ~500 observed previously. This decline corresponds with the transition from early spring into mid-May for this 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU. Lead times have mostly stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (P9, P10 arrived in 2), although historical variance exists. The order from P3 (520 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 11 periods past the order date. Current inventory (On-hand: 476, In-transit: 247 from P13 + 520 lost = 767 total) must be managed carefully. Since the OR backend includes all 'In-transit' units in the pipeline inventory, and it cannot distinguish that 520 units are lost, I must adjust mu_hat or sigma_hat to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. By using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average ~289), the base stock will target (1+2)*289 = 867. However, with 767 in 'pipeline' (including the lost 520), the backend would only order ~100. To ensure the backend places orders that actually cover demand, I will use an explicit L of 2 and an explicit mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 867 + 520 = 1387 to effectively 'nullify' the 520 lost units in the backend's subtraction (base_stock - pipeline). This ensures the physical pipeline (247 units) and on-hand (476 units) are supplemented correctly to meet the ~289/period demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim TRS (skinny jeans). Analysis of historical demand shows two distinct regimes: Period 1-8 averaged ~545 units/period, whereas Period 9-14 has shifted to a lower average of ~272 units/period (a 50% decrease), likely due to seasonal change moving into late spring/early summer. The shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is definitively lost (overdue by 11 periods), while shipments from Period 7, 9, and 10 have arrived. The OR backend counts 'in-transit' units including this lost shipment, so my parameters must account for the fact that the actual usable pipeline is lower than the 977 units reported. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (~272 * (1+L)). I will set L to 'explicit' value 2.5 to account for the recent lead time volatility (1, 2, 3, 2, 2) and potential delays, and increase sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to maintain a buffer against this uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~272 units/period (Period 9-14), down from ~545. Lost shipment from P3 (520 units) persists in reported 'In-transit' but will never arrive.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim). Demand history shows a clear regime shift starting in Period 9; the average demand from P9 to P15 is approximately 287 units, significantly lower than the ~540 units seen in the initial periods. The product description (washed denim) and the date (late May) suggest a transition out of the peak spring season into a more stable or slightly lower summer demand phase. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 977 units in-transit. Crucially, 520 units from Period 3 are confirmed lost, meaning the 'true' pipeline inventory is 457 units (977 - 520). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the next (L+1) periods (approx 900 units) despite the lost shipment ghosting the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I will use a conservative forecast based on the recent regime average (~287) multiplied by (1+L). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 287 = 861. I will also use explicit L and sigma_hat to account for recent lead time variability and the lower volume.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has significantly spiked in the last two periods (P15: 375, P16: 533), suggesting the end of the seasonal low observed between Periods 9-14 (~272 units/period) and a return to the higher volumes seen in the spring (~500+ units/period). As of Period 17 (June 3), we are entering the summer season. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 730 units includes a confirmed lost shipment from Period 3 (520 units) and an overdue order from Period 8 (15 units). The only viable pipeline inventory is the order from Period 14 (195 units). To account for the lost stock that the OR backend still believes is coming, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the immediate demand surge, and using 'explicit' for L to force the backend to consider a 3-period lead time, which helps buffer against the 'phantom' in-transit units and recent delivery delays (P13 arrived in P16, L=3).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: The seasonal low (P9-P14 avg ~272) has ended; Period 16 demand (533) signals a return to higher volume (~500+). Total 'In-transit' includes 535 units from lost/severely overdue shipments (P3, P8) that will not arrive.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 18 (June 10). The product is superstretch denim skinny jeans. Demand has returned to a higher regime (~492 avg in P16-P17) after a seasonal low (P9-P15 avg ~287). The current stockout (On-hand: 0) and high demand signal a need for aggressive replenishment. Pipeline Reconciliation: Reported 'In-transit' is 1404. However, historical evidence (Carry-over insights) confirms Period 3 (520 units) and Period 8 (15 units) shipments are lost, totaling 535 units. Additionally, the Period 14 (195 units) order is now 4 periods old (past the max observed LT of 3) and likely lost. Effective Pipeline = 1404 - 535 - 195 = 674 units (which is only the Period 17 order). Parameters: L is set to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering based on the outlier LT of 3. mu_hat is set to 'explicit' at 1500 (calculated as (1+L) * 500) to match the restored demand regime. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture recent volatility during the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Shipment from Period 14 (195 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P3 and P8 as phantom inventory. Demand regime shift confirmed at ~500 units/period (P16-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context has shifted from a seasonal low (P9-P14 avg ~272) back to a higher regime (P16-P18 avg ~482). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Reconciling In-transit (1616 units): shipments from P3 (520), P8 (15), and P14 (195) are severely overdue (16, 11, and 5 periods respectively) and are considered lost. These 730 units act as 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's calculation (In-transit minus base stock). To compensate and ensure the backend actually places an order to cover the current demand spike, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) at a mean demand of 480 plus a safety buffer, then adding the 730 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct physical amount. L is set to explicit 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P13) confirm lead times are still averaging near the promised value despite some variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments: P3 (520), P8 (15), and P14 (195) totaling 730 units. Demand regime (P16-P18) stabilized at ~480 units/period after seasonal low.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are in a demand regime characterized by a return to moderate volume (~480 units/period) following a seasonal low. Current demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim (last 3 periods) averages 423 units, with a return to higher levels compared to the April-May dip. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' calculation: the reported 2,315 units includes 730 units from confirmed lost shipments (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195). These orders are 17, 12, and 6 periods old respectively, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the observed max of 3. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory' and ensure the OR backend orders enough units to meet demand, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1=3) at ~480 units/period is ~1,440. Currently, the OR engine sees 2,315 units in transit, meaning it would order 0 if I used 'default' methods. By using 'explicit' mu_hat, I set a value that forces the order logic to account for the ~730 unit shortfall in real inventory while projecting demand for the upcoming lead time periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments total 730 units: P3 (520), P8 (15), and P14 (195). These will remain in reported 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Demand regime (P16-P19) is approximately 450-500 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Periods 16-20) shows a return from the seasonal low, averaging 413.8 units/period, though the most recent period saw a dip to 265. Total 'In-transit' (1429 units) includes 730 units from confirmed lost shipments (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195) and the P19 order (699 units) which is still within its expected lead time. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat using 'explicit' at (1+L) * 415 = 1245. I set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility. By using 'explicit' for mu_hat, I ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the actual expected demand while the backend's logic for (inventory + in-transit) will still be partially misled by the 730 lost units, but my higher mu_hat provides a necessary buffer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 22 (July 2019). Demand for skinny denim trousers has stabilized at a moderate level after the seasonal low (P9-P15) and a subsequent peak (P16-P18). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 404 units/period. On-hand inventory is healthy at 967 units. However, there is a critical discrepancy in pipeline inventory: the reported 730 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195) and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts these 730 phantom units from the target base stock, leading to under-ordering. To correct this, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target. Calculation: Effective demand forecast = 400 units/period. Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods = 400 * 3 = 1200 units. To offset the 730 units of phantom inventory that the backend thinks we have, I set mu_hat = 1200 + 730 = 1930. This ensures the backend calculates (base_stock - 1697) relative to a realistic availability of only 967 units. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (explicit) to account for recent demand volatility (range 265-533) and lead time variability (2-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns; previously identified lost shipments (total 730 units) and demand regime (~400 units/period) remain the primary drivers.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/7/15. The product is skinny denim trousers, which typically show stable demand outside of major seasonal transitions. Analysis of recent demand (Period 16-22) shows a stable regime averaging approximately 402 units/period, following a seasonal low. Current on-hand inventory is 574 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1132 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 3, 8, and 14, totaling 730 units (520+15+195). These 730 units will never arrive and must be discounted. The effective pipeline consists only of the Period 22 order (402 units). Total effective inventory (on-hand 574 + effective in-transit 402) is 976 units. Observed lead times recently are 2-3 periods (Average ~2.5). I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=7, covering the stable post-low regime) to ensure the base stock covers demand through the lead time. Given the phantom inventory in the system, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would naturally under-order if it believes the 730 lost units are coming; however, since I cannot manually adjust the pipeline variable in the backend, I am providing accurate L and demand parameters to ensure the base stock target is high enough to satisfy customers while managing holding costs for the remaining ~500 on-hand units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1271.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 24. Demand analysis shows the previous high-volume regime (P16-P18 ~500 units) has cooled slightly to a more stable range of 350-400 units over the last four periods (P20-P23: 265, 353, 393, 369). We are in a summer period (late July) where demand for denim trousers remains moderate but stable. Regarding inventory, there is a significant discrepancy in the reported 'In-transit' figure of 1132. Based on history and Carry-over Insights, 730 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195). The true pipeline inventory consists of the P22 order (402 units). Since 'In-transit' includes 730 phantom units, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will significantly under-order unless we compensate. To bridge this gap, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Formula: mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Phantom_Inventory. With L=2, Forecast=380, and Phantom=730, mu_hat = (3 * 380) + 730 = 1870. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for the fact that 730 units of the reported pipeline will never arrive.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25, the demand for this denim SKU has entered a stable regime post-seasonal low (Periods 16-24), with an average of approximately 382 units per period. The critical challenge remains the high 'In-transit' figure of 1,736 units, which is heavily inflated by 730 units of confirmed lost/phantom shipments from Periods 3 (520), 8 (15), and 14 (195). These orders are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and observed lead times of 1-3. Additionally, orders from P22 (402 units) and P24 (604 units) have not yet arrived. The order from P22 is now 3 periods old (matching the maximum observed lead time); if it doesn't arrive next period, it may also be lost. To bridge the gap between the OR engine's visibility and reality, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to reflect recent delivery delays and 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1+L)*382 = 1528. This allows the backend to account for the longer pipeline. I am also using 'explicit' sigma_hat (200) based on recent demand volatility (std ~100 across review+lead time).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments (total 730 units) from P3, P8, and P14 persist in 'In-transit' but will never arrive; P22 order (402 units) is now at the upper limit of observed lead time (3 periods).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August, following a period of relatively lower demand (average ~340 units/period since Period 19). We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 1736 units is highly misleading: it includes 730 units from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P8, P14) and 402 units from P22 (which is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost). This leaves only the P24 order of 604 units as viable pipeline inventory. If we do not account for these lost units, the OR backend's base-stock logic will assume we are overstocked and stop ordering. To bridge this, I am setting L=3 (reflecting recent lead time trends) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. My mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Lost_Shipments = (1+3) * 350 + 1132 = 2532. This forces the base stock high enough to account for the phantom inventory and trigger a replenishment order. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment from Period 22 (402 units) as it is now 4 periods overdue (Promised L=2, observed max L=3); Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' now reaches 1132 units (P3, P8, P14, P22).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/12. We are facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand units and demand significantly exceeding supply due to delayed/lost shipments. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 2468 units, but based on historical analysis, 1132 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195, P22: 402). These phantom units mislead the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline). To correct for this, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3.0 to reflect recent delivery delays and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I am calculating mu_hat based on the current demand regime (approx. 350-400 units/period) and then manually adding the 1132 lost units to the base stock calculation to force the backend to place an order that covers the physical gap. Calculation: Forecast for L+1 (4 periods) = 380 * 4 = 1520. Adjusted mu_hat = 1520 + 1132 = 2652. This ensures the OR backend ignores the non-existent 1132 units when calculating the gap between base stock and pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' totals 1132 units (P3, P8, P14, P22) and will never arrive. Current demand regime is stabilized between 350-400 units/period (average ~375).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019/8/19), the SKU is entering the late summer/early fall season. Recent demand (P27: 493) shows an uptick from the previous regime (~375), suggesting a potential return to the ~450-500 level observed earlier. In-transit inventory is currently reported as 2026 units. However, I must account for significant 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are lost and will never arrive: P3 (520), P8 (15), P14 (195), and P22 (402), totaling 1,132 units. Additionally, the order from P24 (604 units) is now 4 periods overdue (Promised L=2, max observed L=3), which suggests it is also likely lost. Including P24, the total phantom inventory reaches 1,736 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 290 units (from P27) against the reported 2026. To bridge this 1,736-unit gap and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand for the (L+1) period PLUS the lost units (approx 375 * 3 + 1736 = 2861). Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value to account for the extreme lead-time uncertainty and the high risk of stockouts seen in the history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment from Period 24 (604 units) as it is 4 periods overdue; total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' now reaches 1736 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24). Demand is showing upward volatility (P27: 493).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 29: on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown upward volatility in the last two periods (493, 432), averaging 462.5, which is higher than the previous stabilization around 375. The In-transit total of 2917 units is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P3 (520), P8 (15), P14 (195), P22 (402), and P24 (604), totaling 1736 units. Subtracting these from the reported In-transit (2917 - 1736) reveals an effective pipeline of 1181 units. To account for this discrepancy and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to phantom stock, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (promised) and 'explicit' mu_hat. mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * Forecast. Using a forecast of 465 (recent mean) and adding a buffer to offset the 1736 phantom units over the lead time horizon is necessary. However, since the backend uses (base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline includes the 1736 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately that amount to ensure an order is triggered. Target mu_hat = (1+2)*465 + 1736 \u2248 3131. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' totals 1736 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24) and will not arrive. Demand regime shifted upwards to ~460 units/period starting Period 27.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (P27-P29) has stabilized at approximately 440 units/period (average of 493, 432, 396). The 'In-transit' figure of 2993 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory from lost shipments. Based on the history, we have confirmed lost orders from P3 (520), P8 (15), P14 (195), P22 (402), and P24 (604), totaling 1736 units. Subtracting these from the 2993 'In-transit' leaves an actual pipeline of 1257 units (P28 order of 891 + P29 order of 366). Since these 1257 units are within the promised lead time of 2 periods, the OR backend's capped policy might prevent an order if it believes the phantom inventory is real. To ensure the backend places a sufficient order to cover the current demand regime (~440/period) over the L+1 window, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1320 (3 periods * 440) and using a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for recent demand volatility and potential lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' totals 1736 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24) and will not arrive. Demand regime shifted upwards to ~440 units/period starting Period 27.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has surged significantly in Period 30 (740 units), following a moderate upward trend (avg ~440 since P27). This spike suggests a seasonal peak in early September, likely back-to-school demand. The current on-hand inventory is low (151). Total In-transit is 2102, but 1736 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24). The 'true' pipeline inventory is only 366 (ordered P29). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this new demand regime and replenish the stock-out risk, I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the current demand level (~500/period) over the look-ahead window (L+1=3). Setting sigma_hat to 150 (explicit) to account for the high volatility seen in P30. By using an explicit mu_hat of 1500 (500 * 3), I force the base stock high enough to offset the 1736 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available supply.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed in Period 30 (740 units), likely seasonal/back-to-school; demand regime adjusted to ~500 units/period. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 1736 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a significant demand spike (P30: 740, P31: 708), likely due to the 'Back to School' season or a transition into autumn. This is a major departure from the previous regime (~440 units). I am setting mu_hat to explicitly account for this higher demand (~720 units per period) across the (L+1) horizon. Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 1736 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24). Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to determine the order quantity, I must increase mu_hat significantly to 'offset' this phantom inventory. If I don't, the backend will assume we have 1736 units coming and order nothing, leading to a stockout. With a promised L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. Expected base stock for 720 units/period is roughly 2160. To force an order despite the 1736 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 3500 (approx 1736 + 1800) to ensure the physical order covers actual demand. I am using 'calculate' for L as the recent arrivals have been stable at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand spike confirmed: Demand increased to ~720 units/period (P30-P31) from ~440. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 1736 units and must be manually offset in mu_hat/sigma_hat to trigger orders.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (Back-to-School/Autumn spike) with Period 30-32 demands of 740, 708, and 707 respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 0. A critical challenge is the presence of 1,736 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P3, P8, P14, P22, and P24) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation (reported In-transit: 3753). To force the backend to place an order despite this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that exceeds (on-hand + reported pipeline). I am setting mu_hat to 6200, which covers the 1,736 phantom units plus roughly 6 periods of high demand (6 * 750) to ensure the capped policy triggers a sufficient order to replenish the stock-out. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, which has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 350 to account for the high volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand spike confirmed: Demand has plateaued at ~710 units/period (P30-P32). Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains at 1,736 units; base stock parameters must be aggressively inflated to overcome this pipeline bias.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 30, 2019. Demand has spiked dramatically, doubling from ~700 in P30-P32 to 1,428 in P33, confirming a major peak (likely Autumn/Back-to-school). Total phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' bucket has reached 1,736 units (orders from P3, P8, P14, P22, P24), which the OR backend incorrectly counts as available supply. To force the backend to place orders despite this 'ghost' stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate current demand at 1,200 units per period. With L=2, the base stock formula requires (1+L) * demand. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 5,336 (3 periods * 1,200 demand + 1,736 offset) to neutralize the phantom inventory and cover the spike. Sigma is set explicitly high (400) to account for the extreme volatility observed in P33.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike confirmed in Period 33 (1,428 units), significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~710. Total phantom inventory remains 1,736 units and continues to bias the pipeline inventory; mu_hat must be adjusted upward by this exact amount to ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) shows significant volatility and seasonal spikes. After an extreme peak in Period 33 (1,428 units), demand returned to a high plateau in Period 34 (748 units). Current on-hand inventory is 1,994 units. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 3,753 units is heavily biased by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 3, 8, 14, 22, and 24, totaling 1,736 phantom units. A recent order from Period 32 (2,017 units) is also overdue (3 periods), potentially adding to the phantom total, though not yet confirmed lost. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 1,736-unit pipeline bias, mu_hat must be manually inflated. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) of high-regime demand (~750/period) plus the 1,736 phantom units to 'neutralize' them in the base stock calculation (3 * 750 + 1736 = 3986). Sigma_hat is set to reflect the extreme volatility observed during this Autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 1,736 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24). Order from Period 32 (2,017 units) is now 3 periods overdue; if it does not arrive by Period 36, phantom inventory will increase to 3,753 units. Demand appears to have stabilized at a high plateau (~750) following the extreme P33 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1036.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 35 was 606 units, following a high plateau (P30-P34 avg ~860, though biased by the extreme P33 spike of 1,428). The current on-hand inventory is 1,388 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 3,753 is heavily compromised by phantom inventory. Specifically, orders from P3 (520), P8 (15), P14 (195), P22 (402), and P24 (604) totaling 1,736 units are confirmed lost. Additionally, the P32 order (2,017 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P32, current start of P36 decision phase), which historically signals a loss in this environment. If we treat P32 as lost, the total phantom inventory is 3,753 (1,736 + 2,017), which matches the reported In-transit exactly. This means there is actually ZERO real stock coming in the pipeline. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite this 'full' pipeline, I must set mu_hat (the target base stock level) to account for both the expected demand and the phantom units. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 4,800: approximately 1,000 units to cover demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods * ~330 units/period, being conservative as demand cooled slightly in P35) plus the 3,753 units to offset the phantom pipeline. This should trigger an order of roughly 400-600 units (Base stock 4,800 - Pipeline 3,753 - On-hand 1,388). L is set to explicit 2 to maintain the standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' now totals 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, and now P32 which is 4 periods overdue). No real units are currently in-transit. Demand is stabilizing at a high plateau, though P35 (606) suggests a slight cooling from the extreme P33 spike.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a high-volume autumn regime, stabilizing around ~600-750 units per period after a major spike in Period 33. Period 36 demand was 581. The reported 'In-transit' of 3,898 units is almost entirely 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments: P3 (520), P8 (15), P14 (195), P22 (402), P24 (604), and P32 (2,017). The total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 3,753 units. Only the order from P36 (145 units) is potentially real. To force the OR backend to order when it incorrectly believes the pipeline is full, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * expected_demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=2, expected demand ~600, and phantom=3753: mu_hat = (3 * 600) + 3753 = 1800 + 3753 = 5553. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7, covering the current regime) to capture recent volatility without being skewed by the extreme P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' now totals 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32). This pipeline bias must be manually offset in mu_hat. Demand has stabilized at ~600 units/period following the autumn spike.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we are managing a high-demand regime for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (approx. 600-650 units/period). The core challenge is the significant pipeline bias caused by 'phantom' in-transit inventory\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived. As of Period 37, the total phantom inventory has risen to 3,753 units (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195, P22: 402, P24: 604, and P32: 2,017). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes these 3,753 units) to determine order quantities, it will effectively stop ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset this ghost stock. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the next 3 periods (L+1=3) of real demand (~1,800 units), mu_hat must be set to the sum of the desired base stock plus the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 5,600 (approx. 3 * 615 + 3,753). Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (400) to account for the high demand volatility and provide a safety buffer against the unreliable lead times observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' now totals 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) and must be manually offset in mu_hat. Demand has stabilized at a plateau of ~600-650 units/period following the autumn spike.

Inventory & Lead Time: On-hand is 916. The reported 'In-transit' of 4,358 units is heavily biased by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P3 (520), P8 (15), P14 (195), P22 (402), P24 (604), and P32 (2,017), totaling 3,753 units. Subtracting these from 4,358 leaves 605 units (the P38 order) as the only legitimate pipeline inventory. 

Strategy: To force the OR engine to order despite the 3,753 phantom units in its pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Phantom units. With L=2 (standard) and a demand forecast of 650, the baseline mu_hat would be 1,950. Adding the 3,753 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 5,703. Sigma_hat is set to 300 to account for potential pre-holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns; phantom inventory remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) and demand is stable at ~650.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the product (706016001) shows a stabilized demand regime following the autumn spike, with recent demand around 485-663 units per period. The critical issue remains the massive pipeline bias caused by phantom inventory. Total confirmed lost shipments are 3,753 units (P3: 520, P8: 15, P14: 195, P22: 402, P24: 604, and P32: 2,017). The OR engine sees 'In-transit: 5040', but 3,753 of these are 'phantom' units that will never arrive. To force the engine to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately this phantom amount. Current 'real' in-transit is 1,287 units (P38: 605, P39: 682). Demand average for the last 4 periods is ~570. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 3,753 phantom units: (1+L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = 3 * 570 + 3753 \u2248 5463. Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' to capture the volatility of the recent high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) and must be manually offset in mu_hat. Demand has slightly cooled from the 600-700 range to ~485 in Period 39, but requires monitoring for further deceleration.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019/11/18), the inventory state shows 0 on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 5,134 units. However, based on historical analysis, 3,753 of these units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32). This leaves a real pipeline of 1,381 units (P38 order of 605, P39 order of 682, and P40 order of 94). Demand has stabilized at a post-peak plateau of approximately 575 units/period (average of P35-P40). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 3,753 phantom units in the 'pipeline inventory' (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this bias. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * expected_demand + phantom_units. With L=2, this is (3 * 575) + 3753 = 5478. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility (std dev ~75 over the last 6 periods), scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is approx 130.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) and must be manually offset in mu_hat. Demand regime following the autumn spike has settled at ~575 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Late Autumn). Demand for high-waisted skinny denim has stabilized at a post-spike plateau of approximately 575 units/period (mean of P34-P41). Inventory levels are critical: on-hand is only 58 units. The 'In-transit' report shows 4,983 units, but 3,753 of these are confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) that will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P39 (682 units) is now at Period 3 (L=3), which is the upper bound of recent successful arrivals; if it does not arrive in Period 42, it may also be lost. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be inflated by the total phantom inventory (3,753) to offset the pipeline bias. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Phantom_Inventory. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 575) + 3753 = 1725 + 3753 = 5478. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the volatility of the post-spike regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: No new significant patterns; demand regime remains stable at ~575 units/period post-autumn spike. Total phantom inventory remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) and must be manually offset in mu_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2960.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed an extreme demand surge of 3,100 units, significantly higher than the previous autumn plateau of ~600-700. This is likely a 'Black Friday' or major pre-holiday event given the date (Nov 25). The total 'In-transit' is reported as 4,854, but 3,753 of these are confirmed phantom/lost units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32). Real units in transit are only 1,101 (from P40, P41, P42). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the remaining holiday season and clear the pipeline bias, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and inflated. I am setting mu_hat to 5,500 (representing roughly 1,750 expected demand per period over L+1, plus the 3,753 phantom offset) to force a substantial order despite the false inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike in Period 42 (3,100 units) confirmed as a seasonal event (Black Friday). Phantom inventory remains at 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32), requiring manual inflation of mu_hat to trigger necessary orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/9), we are in the post-Black Friday period. Period 42 saw a massive spike (3,100 units), while Period 43 returned to a more typical high-season level (674 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 6,416 units is heavily distorted by 3,753 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, and P32 that will never arrive). After subtracting these phantom units, the real pipeline consists of orders from P41 (454), P42 (553), and P43 (1,656), totaling 2,663 units. With on-hand inventory at 0, these 2,663 units must cover demand for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 3 periods). The demand regime has stabilized around 600-700 units post-autumn spike, excluding the Black Friday outlier. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' tally, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate (L+1) demand to be roughly 2,100 (700 units * 3 periods) but I must add the 3,753 phantom units to the base stock calculation to offset the pipeline bias, resulting in a mu_hat of ~5,850. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 600 to account for the high volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32). Black Friday (P42) demand peaked at 3,100. Post-peak demand is stabilizing at approximately 650-700 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). The Black Friday demand spike (P42: 3,100 units) has passed, and demand has stabilized at ~680 units/period (P43-P44). On-hand inventory is 1,430 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 4,306 units is highly misleading due to 3,753 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, and P32 that will never arrive). Real units in transit are: P42 order (553 units). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be biased by these 3,753 phantom units, preventing it from ordering despite a potential stockout. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the current demand regime (L=2, so 3 periods of demand: 3 * 680 = 2,040) and add the phantom inventory (3,753) to it, totaling 5,793. This ensures the backend calculates (5,793 - 4,306) = ~1,487 as the target position, prompting an order that covers future demand without being suppressed by the lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (250) to account for recent high volatility (Black Friday and autumn spikes).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the post-Black Friday holiday season. Demand has stabilized at a plateau of ~650-680 units per period (P43: 674, P44: 680, P45: 657) following the extreme spike in P42. The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the reported In-transit pipeline. Analysis shows a total of 3,753 units from orders (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) that are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost. The current reported In-transit is 4,021 units, which includes these 3,753 lost units plus the order from P45 (268 units). To ensure the OR backend (which uses 'base_stock - pipeline') actually places an order, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset this 3,753 unit bias. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With L=2 and Expected_Demand=670, this is (3 * 670) + 3753 = 5763. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the current stable volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand plateau confirmed at ~670 units/period. Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32) and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent stockouts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019/12/30), we are in the post-holiday season. Demand has stabilized following the Black Friday spike (P42) and subsequent December plateau, with the most recent demand (P46) at 475 units. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 4,187 units, which contains 3,753 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, and P32 that are long overdue and will never arrive). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce orders; to counteract this bias, mu_hat must be inflated. The current demand regime (P43-P46) averages ~621 units. To trigger a replenishment order that covers the next 3 periods (L=2 + 1 review period), the base stock needs to be approximately 1,863 units. However, because the backend sees 3,753 units already in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at a value that forces the backend to recognize a higher requirement than the phantom inventory. I estimate the necessary mu_hat to be ~1,850 units for the (1+L) period, but I must offset the 3,753 phantom units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1850 + 3753 = 5603 units to ensure the capped policy allows for actual replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 3,753 units (P3, P8, P14, P22, P24, P32). Post-holiday demand (late Dec) has settled at ~475-500 units, indicating a return to the standard ~600 units/period regime for early Q1.
