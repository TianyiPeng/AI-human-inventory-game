Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). This is a core 'Divided Collection' staple product. Past demands are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], showing a relatively stable demand with a slight upward trend in the last few periods (mean \u2248 689). The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for sale in the same period. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to set parameters that trigger an immediate replenishment to cover Period 1 demand. I will use the mean of the available 5 historical samples (~689) as the base for mu_hat and calculate the standard deviation (~72) for sigma_hat. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand parameters captures the current regime while we await fresh observations.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a core high-waisted skinny denim item. Historical demand over the last 6 samples (694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671) shows a stable mean of approximately 686. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirm this with the order arriving immediately. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 0.80. Ending on-hand is low at 79 units, meaning we need a full replenishment for the current demand period. I will use the recent N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean, while keeping L at default (0) as verified by the Period 1 arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is high-waisted skinny denim (706016001). We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). Past 5 demands were [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. Periods 1 and 2 showed demands of 671 and 673, respectively, which are consistent with the historical mean (~688). The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time for Periods 1 and 2 was confirmed as 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (5 historical + 2 game periods) to capture the stable demand mean. Given the high sales volume and relatively low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), maintaining a precise base stock is important to avoid excessive holding costs while preventing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1961.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny denim trouser from the Divided collection. We are in Period 4 (Early March). History shows high demand in the first two periods (671, 673) followed by a significant drop in Period 3 (539). The past demands provided in the prompt [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] suggest a generally higher baseline (mean ~688) than the recent Period 3 observation. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the recent volatility and the demand drop, while the OR backend's base-stock calculation (profit $4, holding $1) will maintain an ~80% service level. This balances the risk of a continued demand dip against the potential for a rebound as spring fashion shopping typically picks up in March.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim trouser item. Analysis of the historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] provided in the context alongside the game history [671, 673, 539, 447] shows a clear downward trend in the most recent periods (starting from Period 3). The demand dropped from ~670 to ~450. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot toward the lower demand levels observed in Periods 3 and 4, while still accounting for the slightly higher Period 2 demand to avoid under-ordering if the drop was temporary. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: Average demand decreased from ~680 to ~490 (-28%) over the last two periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. We are entering Period 6 (March 18, 2019). The historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] provided in the prompt appears to be pre-game data, while in-game observations for Periods 1-5 show a distinct downward shift: P1-2 averaged ~672, while P3-5 averaged ~485. This suggests a transition out of a high-demand period (possibly early spring/back-to-school) into a lower baseline. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 game periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new lower-demand regime (avg ~485) while ignoring the initial high-demand spikes. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand reduction confirmed: Periods 3-5 average demand is 485 units, compared to Period 1-2 average of 672 units (-27.8% change).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. We are currently at Period 7 (March 25, 2019). Analyzing the history, demand has clearly shifted into a lower regime since Period 3. Average demand for Periods 1-2 was ~672, whereas average demand for Periods 3-6 (the last 4 periods) is 489. Standard deviation since Period 3 is approximately 40.5. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent historical data confirms arrivals occur in the same period they are ordered (actual lead time = 0). There are currently only 24 units on hand and 0 in transit, so a replenishment order is necessary. To avoid overstocking while demand is in this stabilized lower regime, I will use a recent_N window of 4 to capture the current mean (~489) and volatility (~40.5).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Demand regime fully stabilized at a lower mean of ~490 (Periods 3-6) compared to the initial Period 1-2 mean of ~672.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (Divided Collection), typically a staple item. Since Period 3 (late February), demand has shifted from an initial high of ~670 to a stable lower mean of ~490 units. The last four periods (P4-P7) show demands of 447, 468, 502, and 511, indicating a slight upward trend within this lower regime as spring begins in April. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this stabilized demand regime (avg 485.4) while allowing for the recent slight increase. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same N=5 window to reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is low (12 units), so a full order for the upcoming period is required to meet demand and maintain the target service level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-2 averaged ~672 units, while Periods 3-8 have settled into a lower mean of approximately 504 units (539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560). However, the last period (Period 8) showed a demand of 560, exceeding the available inventory of 524, indicating a possible slight upward trend as spring progresses. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 observed cycles. To account for the stabilized lower demand while being responsive to the recent slight increase and stockout, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (covering the post-shift regime from Period 3 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the lower average against recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed since Period 3: Average stabilized at ~504 units (Periods 3-8) from initial ~672. Period 8 exhibited a stockout (demand 560 vs 524 stock), suggesting a potential seasonal uptick in early April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), we observe that lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Historical demand shows two distinct regimes: an initial high demand (Periods 1-2, avg ~672) and a stabilized lower demand (Periods 3-9, avg ~480). Although Period 8 showed a spike to 560 (stockout), Period 9 dropped significantly to 335. This drop in Period 9 might be a normalization after the Period 8 spike or a temporary fluctuation. Given the product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', it's a staple item (High-waisted jeans) where demand should remain relatively steady. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the entire second regime (Periods 3-9), resulting in a mean of approximately 481. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to capture the volatility of this stabilized period, which includes both the stockout spike and the recent dip. This approach ensures we are responsive to the lower demand level while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand volatility observed within the second regime (Periods 3-9); while the average is ~481, recent weeks fluctuated between 335 and 560, necessitating a wider sigma to prevent stockouts like the one in Period 8.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' shows a significant downward trend in demand over the last two periods (335 and 269 units) following a brief peak in early April (Period 8). This suggests the post-Easter/mid-Spring demand for this specific denim item is tapering off. The second regime (starting Period 3) initially stabilized around 480-500 units, but the most recent four periods (Post-April 1st) average approximately 420 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower demand average using the last 4 periods (N=4) to avoid overstocking and high holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 275 units. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=8) to capture the higher volatility seen throughout the entire second stable regime, ensuring the service level protects against spikes like the one seen in Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand softening observed post-early April peak. Average demand dropped to 302 units over the last two weeks (Periods 9-10), compared to the prior regime average of ~500.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) has shown a clear downward demand shift since early April. Historically, the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Recent demand in Periods 9, 10, and 11 was 335, 269, and 261 respectively, indicating the regime has stabilized at a lower mean. The average demand of the last three periods (N=3) is approximately 288 units. This represents a significant softening from the earlier spring peak (which reached 560 units in Period 8). Using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to quickly adjust to this lower demand level, reducing the risk of excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current trend. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as all 11 previous orders arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~500 to ~288 (-42%) over the last three periods (Periods 9-11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a third demand regime starting from Period 9 (2019/4/08). Observed demand for the last four weeks (Period 9-12) has been [335, 269, 261, 339], with an average of 301 units. This represents a significant drop from the prior regime (Periods 3-8 avg ~504). Period 12 resulted in a stockout (sold 323 vs demand 339) due to a very conservative order in Period 11 and 12 when inventory was still high. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 0 (consistently observed as 0), I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower local average and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility (range 261-339). This approach balances the need to replenish immediately while acknowledging the sustained lower demand pattern.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) has settled into a lower demand regime starting around Period 9. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 289 units (335, 269, 261, 339, 241). The date is May 13th, transitioning further into late spring where high-waisted denim interest typically remains stable but lower than early spring peaks. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 96 units, and there are currently 0 units in transit following the arrival of the P13 order. To maintain a responsive but cost-efficient stock for Period 14, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this current regime (~289 units/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (std approx 44), ensuring we cover the immediate demand while managing the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' shows a clear downward trend across three distinct regimes. Regime 1 (P1-P2) averaged ~672 units. Regime 2 (P3-P8) averaged ~500 units. Regime 3 started around Period 9 and has seen even lower demand. Looking at the most recent data (Periods 9-14), demands were: 335, 269, 261, 339, 241, 189. The average over these last 6 periods is 272 units, with a noticeable secondary drop in the last two weeks (avg 215). This suggests a seasonal decline in denim interest as summer approaches in late May. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this lower volume accurately while providing enough safety stock to handle the moderate variance seen in this regime (range 189-339).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 9: Average demand has stabilized at ~272 units (Periods 9-14), a significant decrease from the previous regime's ~500 units (-45%). Demand continues to show a downward trend into late May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), the demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers shows high volatility within the current low-demand regime. While the average since Period 9 is approximately 282 units, we have seen significant fluctuations, most recently a surge to 375 units in Period 15 which caused a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This suggests a possible seasonal shift or late-May peak. Given that the promised lead time remains 0, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, Periods 9-15) to capture the current regime's average (~281) but using an explicit sigma_hat set to 100 to provide a wider safety buffer against the observed high volatility and prevent recurring stockouts. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as all historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a unexpected significant demand spike as we enter June. Despite a previous stabilization around 272 units (Periods 9-14), demand surged to 375 in Period 15 and 533 in Period 16, leading to back-to-back stockouts. This surge aligns with early June seasonal shopping. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent further lost sales, I am shifting focus to the most recent high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the current upward trend while increasing sigma to account for the high volatility observed during these spikes (375 to 533). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the immediate demand environment to replenish stock quickly.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge starting Period 15: Demand increased from a mean of ~272 to an average of 454 (+67%) over the last two periods, coinciding with the start of June. Stockouts occurred in both P15 and P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1706.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant upward shift starting in Period 15 (late May/early June), coinciding with seasonal demand for denim. Periods 15-17 demand values are [375, 533, 451], averaging ~453 units per period. This is a sharp increase from the previous regime average of ~272 units. Stockouts occurred in Periods 15 and 16 due to this sudden surge. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this June peak and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new higher-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility (375 to 533) associated with this growth phase. The OR backend will use these values to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed for June: Average demand has increased to ~453 units (Periods 15-17), up 66% from the prior regime average of ~272. This shift aligns with early summer seasonality for denim trousers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers, currently in mid-June. A significant demand shift occurred at Period 15, coinciding with the start of June, where demand increased from ~272 to ~455 units. Recent demands are 375, 533, 451, and 462. The average for this new regime (Periods 15-18) is 455.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 64 units. Given the seasonality of denim in early summer and the consistency of the last four weeks, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this 'June jump' while maintaining a higher sigma_hat (recent_N=4) to account for the volatility seen in Period 16 (demand 533) and prevent stockouts. Lead time remains 0 based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrived same-period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1280.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in June (Period 15). Demand over the last five periods (P15-P19) has been 375, 533, 451, 462, and 358, averaging ~436 units. The most recent period (P19) showed a slight dip to 358, but the overall June trend remains significantly higher than the May average of ~272. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. Given the criticality of avoiding stockouts during this high-demand summer period (June stockouts occurred in P15 and P16), I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current June regime while accounting for the recent volatility seen in the last week. The backend calculates the base stock using a q-ratio of 0.8 ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding)), which ensures a high service level appropriate for this SKU's profitability.

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime continues: Average demand for Periods 15-19 is 435.8 units, compared to the May (P11-14) average of 257.5 units (+69% increase).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) shows a strong performance in June (Periods 15-19 mean: 435.8), but a significant drop in Period 20 (demand: 265). This drop corresponds to the transition from late June into July (7/1). Given that this is a 'Divided Collection' skinny denim trouser, we likely saw a seasonal peak in June which may be cooling off as summer heat intensifies, making heavy denim less preferred. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy (231). To avoid overstocking while demand appears to be softening, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (Periods 15-20), which captures the entire high-demand June window plus the recent drop. This average (~407) is safer than the full history but more responsive to the recent slowdown than using only the June peak. I will use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat as well to account for the high volatility seen during this regime (range 265 to 533). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed entering July: Period 20 demand (265) is significantly lower than the June (P15-19) average of 435.8, suggesting a potential end to the summer denim peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (skinny jeans) shows clear evidence of seasonal transitions. After a high-demand period in June (avg ~435), July demand has moderated. Period 20 recorded 265 units and Period 21 recorded 353 units. The average of the last two periods is 309, which is significantly lower than the June peak but higher than the May trough (~257). This suggests a post-summer-peak stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward transition from the June peak (captures 358, 265, and 353), providing a mean of 325.3 per period. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the current volatility between the cooling periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed following June peak (P15-19 avg: 435.8). Distribution for early July (P20-21) has shifted to an average of 309 units (-29% from June peak).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the SKU 706016001 (high-waisted denim trousers) is in a post-peak summer regime. After a high-demand period in June (avg ~436), July demand has shifted. Although the Carry-over Insight for Period 22 suggested a cooling to ~309 units, the actual demands for P21 (353) and P22 (393) indicate that the cooling is less severe than initially thought or that there is mid-July volatility. The stockout in P22 (sold 370 on demand 393) confirms that current stock levels are insufficient for these fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P20-P22: 265, 353, 393) to capture this stabilized but slightly volatile July level (avg ~337). Given the recent stockout and the product's super-skinny denim nature (potential for lingering summer demand), I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: July demand has stabilized higher than late June anticipated; average for P20-P22 is 337 units, which is a -23% reduction from the June peak (as opposed to the -29% previously estimated).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim trousers) is currently transitions through late July. After a peak in June (avg ~435 units), demand cooled in early July but has since stabilized at a higher level than initially predicted. The last three periods (P21-P23) show demands of 353, 393, and 369, creating an average of 371.7 units. This indicates a sustained July plateau higher than the late June lull (265 units). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized July demand, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 370-unit average while maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the volatility seen in P22 (demand 393), avoiding the stockouts experienced earlier in the month.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July (P21-P23) at an average of ~372 units, which is a -15% reduction from the June peak (avg 435) but significantly higher than the late June dip (265).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' in late July (Period 24) dropped to 232 units, following a stabilized July average of approximately 372 units (Periods 21-23). This late July drop aligns with the transition away from the peak summer denim season observed in June. Given the volatility within this regime (fluctuating between 232 and 393 in July), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4, Periods 21-24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the broader July average while incorporating the most recent downturn. The lead time remains consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), so L=0 is maintained via the 'calculate' method. On-hand inventory is 157, and the backend will use the provided mu and sigma to cover the expected demand for Period 25.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed at the end of July (Period 24 demand: 232) vs. the earlier July average (Periods 21-23 avg: 372), representing a ~38% week-over-week decline as the summer peak fades.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is entering a new phase. Following the June peak (avg ~435) and a volatile July (avg ~327), the most recent two periods (P24: 232, P25: 298) show a stabilization at a lower level of approximately 265 units. This aligns with late summer seasonality where demand for denim typically softens before a potential late-August 'back-to-school' uptick. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand is cooling, mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated based on the last 5 periods (P21-P25), which captures the transition from the mid-July levels to the current late-July/early-August cooling. This provides a mean demand estimate of ~309 units, which is conservative but sufficient to cover recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed entering August: Average demand for the last five periods (P21-P25) has decreased to 309 units, a 29% reduction from the June peak (avg 435).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical analysis shows we've moved through several regimes: a high-demand initial phase, a mid-spring dip, a significant June peak (avg ~435), and most recently, an August cooling. The demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has been: 353, 393, 369, 232, 298, 381. This averages to approximately 337 units, but with high volatility (observed stockout in P22 and very low on-hand in P26). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent August bounce (381 units) and the volatility of the July/August transition, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the post-June-peak average of 337 units. I will use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to maintain higher safety stock given the recent high variability and the low inventory levels at start of period (on-hand: 3).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: August demand remains volatile but stabilized higher than late July anticipated; average for P21-P26 is ~337 units, maintaining a moderate sales level after the June summer peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is entering late August. Demand in Period 27 (493) spiked significantly above the August baseline observed so far (~337), leading to a stockout. This suggest a potential 'Back to School' or late-summer surge for denim trousers. The current average demand for the August period (P25-P27) is approximately 390 units. Given the recent stockout and the clear trend towards higher demand in mid-August, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this upward movement. While lead time remains consistently 0 periods, I will maintain the 'default' method as it successfully matches the promised 0-period arrival. sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three weeks (demand: 298, 381, 493).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed in mid-August (Back-to-School period): Average demand for P25-P27 increased to 390 units from the early August average of ~300. Stockout occurred in Period 27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (superstretch skinny denim) is currently in a 'Back-to-School' high-demand regime. Analysis of the last four periods (P25-P28) shows demand levels of 298, 381, 493, and 432 units, resulting in a mean of 401 units. This is a significant jump from the early August mean of ~300. We stabilized the inventory after a stockout in Period 27, but Period 28 ending on-hand is low (42 units). Given the current date (August 26), we expect this elevated demand to persist or slightly level off as school starts. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this specific seasonal surge (mean ~401), and a recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen throughout August. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed (mid-to-late August): Average demand for P25-P28 is 401 units, representing a 33% increase over the early August (P21-P24) average of 301 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, marks the transition from the Back-to-School season into early autumn. Recent demand history shows a clear 'Back-to-School' surge beginning in mid-August (Period 27 demand of 493 followed by 432 and 396). The average demand for the most recent regime (P27-P29) is approximately 440 units, which is significantly higher than the early August average (~320). However, the demand of 396 in Period 29 suggests the peak intensity is beginning to taper off as the school season starts. For Period 30, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this elevated demand regime while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) seen during season shifts (stockout in P27). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by daily arrivals equal to orders in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Back-to-School peak observed from P27-P29 (avg ~440 units) shows early signs of tapering as of P29 (396 units) as the calendar moves into September.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1872.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) exhibited a massive, unexpected spike in Period 30, reaching 740 units (compared to the previous few weeks' average of ~440). This resulted in a stockout. September typically marks the transition into cooler weather and the heart of the autumn fashion season, which can drive demand for denim trousers. While Period 29 showed a slight tapering from the mid-August peak, Period 30 clearly signals a new high-demand regime or a second peak within the back-to-school/autumn window. To capture this surge and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 600 (a balanced buffer above the recent 440 average but recognizing the 740 peak may be semi-outlier or the start of a very high plateau). I have also increased sigma_hat explicitly to 150 to account for the significantly increased volatility seen over the last four periods (range 396 to 740). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Significant autumn demand surge observed in Period 30 (740 units), nearly double the early September average (~400). This suggests a strong autumn peak for skinny jeans following the back-to-school period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) has entered a significant autumn demand peak. After the Back-to-School surge (P27-P29, avg ~440), demand spiked to 740 in Period 30 and remained very high at 708 in Period 31. This confirms a new high-demand regime, likely driven by the transition into cooler weather in mid-September. The current on-hand inventory is critically low at 19 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I must set parameters to satisfy this elevated demand immediately. I will use a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific two-period autumn surge (~724 units average) while maintaining a high safety stock to avoid further stockouts during this peak. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed starting Period 30: Average demand increased to 724 units (P30-P31), representing a ~65% increase over the Back-to-School average (~440).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (High-waisted skinny jeans) has entered a significant autumn demand peak starting in September (Period 30). Demand has jumped from a 'Back-to-School' average of ~440 units to an 'Autumn Peak' average of 718.3 units (P30: 740, P31: 708, P32: 707). This shift is sustained and mirrors typical retail patterns for denim in late September/early October. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime precisely. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. Setting mu_hat using the 3-period average (~718) ensures the base stock reflects the immediate autumn trend, while a tight sigma based on the low variance of these three weeks prevents excessive holding costs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim trousers) has entered a massive autumn peak. Period 33 demand spiked to 1428 units, a 100% increase from the already high average of ~718 observed in Periods 30-32. This peak aligns with late September/early October fashion cycles. Because lead time is consistently 0, I must order enough to cover this new extreme demand level to avoid further stockouts, as the 'on-hand' inventory is currently 0. I will use 'explicit' values to capture this surge, setting mu_hat based on the most recent demand spike (1428) and increasing sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed at the peak of this seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak intensification: Demand doubled from ~718 (P30-P32) to 1428 in Period 33. This confirms a super-peak in late September for skinny jeans, significantly exceeding the earlier autumn surge.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) enters Period 35 (early October) with a history of a massive demand spike in late September (Period 33 demand: 1428 units). While Period 34 demand normalized slightly to 748 units, the previous two periods (P33-P34) averaged ~1088 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier autumn baseline (P30-P32 avg: ~718). The on-hand inventory is currently 933 units, which is slightly above the most recent demand of 748 but potentially insufficient if the super-peak persists. Given the seasonality of skinny jeans and the historical shift from P32 to P33, I will set mu_hat using the last two periods (N=2) to capture the current high-demand level (~1088 units) while using a wide sigma (N=5) to account for the extreme volatility observed during this transition (707 to 1428 to 748). This strategy aims to ensure availability for a potential sustained super-peak while protecting against obsolescence if demand continues to stabilize at the lower ~750 level.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak observed late Sept (P33: 1428 units); demand recently stabilized in early Oct at ~748 (P34). Current high-demand regime (P33-P34) average is 1088 units compared to the early autumn (P30-P32) average of 718 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019) occurs as the high-demand autumn peak for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' appears to be easing from its late-September 'super-peak'. The demand shifted from an average of ~718 (P30-P32) to a massive 1428 (P33), followed by 748 (P34) and 606 (P35). Average demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) is 927 units. However, the most recent two periods (P34-P35) average 677 units, which is closer to the early autumn baseline. Given current on-hand inventory of 747 units, a base stock targeting this ~677-700 range is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs as the peak subsides. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the high-volume autumn regime while reflecting the recent downward trend from the super-peak. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=3) to account for the extreme volatility observed during this transition (3-period std is ~440, ensuring a strong safety stock buffer against potential late-October spikes).

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn peak tapering: Following the late-September super-peak (P33: 1428), demand has trended downward in early October (P34-P35 avg: 677), returning toward the early autumn baseline (~718) but remaining highly volatile.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 34-36) confirms a significant tapering following the late-September peak (P33). Demand has stabilized around an average of 645 units (P34-P36: 748, 606, 581), which is a clear shift from the super-peak period but remains within the high-demand autumn season for denim trousers. The current on-hand inventory is 717 units. With a lead time of 0, the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the current period's demand. Given the downward trend from the peak, I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the most current stabilization level (avg ~645). A higher sigma_hat is manually set via recent_N to account for the high volatility observed during these seasonal transitions (from 1428 to 581 in three weeks), ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts while demand finds its late-October floor.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Autumn peak tapering confirmed; demand stabilized at a lower mean of 645 units (Periods 34-36) following the late-September super-peak (1428 units).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is moving past its late-September super-peak (1428 units) into a stabilized autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has focused around a mean of 644.5 units (748, 606, 581, 643), which is lower than the initial autumn peak (~720) but markedly higher than the summer baseline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Inventory is currently lean (78 on hand) following a minimal order in Period 37 designed to clear excess safety stock from the peak period. To maintain a high service level while the mean is stable, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak mean and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current variance. This approach ensures we keep enough stock to meet the ~645 average demand without overstocking as the season potentially matures into November.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime has stabilized at a mean of ~645 units for the second half of October (Periods 34-37), following the late-September peak. Volatility has also decreased compared to the super-peak period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has stabilized following the late-September peak (1428 units). Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 648.2 units (748, 606, 581, 643, 663), showing significantly lower volatility compared to the earlier autumn surge. As of Period 39 (Nov 4), we are moving deeper into the autumn/winter season where demand for high-waisted jeans typically remains steady but potentially faces a slight downward trend before holiday spikes. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for P1-P38. Starting on-hand is low (44), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to meet the base stock level calculated from the recent 648-unit mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-autumn peak (P34-P38) at a mean of ~648 units with lower volatility compared to the late-September surge.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has stabilized following the extreme late-September/early-October peaks. Since Period 34, demand has consistently ranged between 485 and 748 units, with the most recent sample (P39) at 485. This suggests a tapering of the autumn peak as we enter mid-November. The current regime (P34-P39) has a mean of approximately 622 units and a standard deviation of 94. We will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient responsiveness to the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The transition from October to November often sees a slight cooling in denim demand before potential holiday-related activity, so the 'recent_N' approach balances the higher October demand with the lower most recent observation (485).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-autumn peak (Periods 34-39) with a mean of ~622 units, showing a gradual decline from the late-September high as the season progresses into November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has stabilized since mid-October (Period 34). Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the average demand is 615 units. The most recent demand (P40) was 581 units, following 485 in P39, indicating a gradual cooling as we move further into November, but still maintaining a significant volume. The current on-hand inventory is 115 units. Given that the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods, I will set L to 0 (default). To capture the stable but slightly declining post-peak demand, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the post-peak stability since P34) to average the 615 units per period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the current volatility in this stabilized regime, ensuring a safe base stock level to prevent stockouts while considering the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit (targeting an 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-autumn peak (Periods 34-40) at a mean of ~615 units, indicating a consistent but slightly lower volume than the late September super-peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period 42 (late November) shows a sustained stabilization following the autumn peak. Since Period 34, demand has moved from a high of 1428 units back down to a more consistent range between 485 and 663 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 583.8 units, while the last 8 periods (P34-P41) average is 606.75. Given the proximity to the holiday season and the product being high-waisted denim skinny jeans, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly decrease as the peak season concludes. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 captures this post-peak stabilization. I will use N=8 for sigma_hat as well to provide a robust buffer against the lingering volatility observed since the September super-peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25, leading into Black Friday week), demand surged to 3100 units, far exceeding the recent stable mean of ~615. This is a clear seasonal super-peak associated with late November retail events. Because on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending 0), we must anticipate that demand in early December (Period 43) may remain highly elevated or experience a 'halo effect' from the holiday shopping season. Given the promised lead time of 0, I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover a significant potential demand of 2500 units to avoid further stockouts, while using a high sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to account for the extreme volatility observed at this seasonal peak. A lead time of 0 allows us to fulfill this demand immediately if the OR engine places the order.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak observed late November (P42: 3100 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. This follows the previous autumn peak and suggests a new, high-volatility holiday demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a massive demand spike in Period 42 (3,100 units), likely corresponding to a major holiday event like Black Friday/Cyber Monday, as the product is skinny denim trousers. Period 43 demand returned to a more normalized level (674 units), consistent with the pre-holiday mean of approximately 615-620 units (Periods 34-41 average). As we are now in early December (2019/12/9), we must distinguish between the single-period super-peak and the sustained seasonal demand. The Period 42 spike is an outlier for regular replenishment but suggests a high-volatility regime. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the elevated autumn/holiday baseline while smoothing the massive Period 42 spike, and an explicit sigma_hat of 800 to account for the extreme volatility observed recently, preventing excessive stockouts if another December spike occurs. Current on-hand is high (2781) due to a large order placed after the P42 stockout, which should cover several periods if demand stays at the 600-700 level.

Carry-over insight: Holiday super-peak confirmed late Nov (P42: 3100 units); demand returned to seasonal baseline in early Dec (P43: 674 units). Pre-holiday mean (P34-P41) was ~615 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The session is approaching its end (Period 45 of 47). Current date is Dec 16. Demand for the last two periods after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday super-peak (P42) has stabilized at 674 and 680 units, which is slightly higher but consistent with the pre-holiday mean of ~615 (P34-P41). We currently have 2101 units on-hand. With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), and an expected demand of ~680 units per period, our total future need is approximately 2040 units. Since on-hand (2101) already covers the remaining lifetime demand, the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline - OnHand) will naturally result in zero or minimal orders if we provide accurate parameters. I will use a recent_N of 2 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the post-peak stability (Avg: 677, Std: 4). This will ensure we don't over-order during the final periods and minimize holding costs for the large existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (early Dec) has stabilized at ~677 units (P43-P44), returning to the seasonal baseline observed prior to the late-November super-peak.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a seasonal baseline after the late November Black Friday super-peak. For Periods 43-45, demand values were 674, 680, and 657, yielding a mean of 670 units with very low volatility (std \u2248 12). Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 1444 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately two periods of demand at the current rate. Given that we are entering the final week of December, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this post-holiday stabilization. This will set a base stock level that aligns with current demand while managing the existing high on-hand inventory, likely resulting in a zero or small order to minimize holding costs for the final project periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (Dec) has stabilized at ~670 units (P43-P45) with significantly lower volatility compared to the autumn and holiday peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in a post-holiday demand regime (late December). Historically, demand for skinny jeans typically softens after the autumn and Black Friday/Cyber Monday peaks, which we are observing: Period 46 demand was 475, down from the early December average of ~677. On-hand inventory is currently high (969 units) because of a large order placed during the Black Friday peak (Period 43). With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the current on-hand inventory should comfortably cover the expected demand for Period 47. Based on the recent three periods (P44-P46), the average demand is 604 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this cooling trend while maintaining enough coverage, and default sigma_hat to account for historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening confirmed: Period 46 demand (475) dropped significantly from the early-December average (~677), indicating the end of the year-end peak regime.
