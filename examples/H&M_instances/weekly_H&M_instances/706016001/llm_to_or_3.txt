Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is an HM Skinny Denim TRS (High-waisted jeans), which generally has stable but fashion-susceptible demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observation history yet, I will use the baseline settings. I have five past demand samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. The mean of these samples is 688.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 72.8. Given the lead time (L=4), the inventory needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using these defaults to satisfy the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, no arrivals were expected yet. Therefore, 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is normal. Demand in Period 1 was 671, which aligns with the historical average (approx. 689). The current on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals haven't started. The OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline that covers L+1 periods of demand. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Given the stability of the early demand samples (694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671), the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat is currently appropriate as there is no evidence of a regime shift or seasonal spike yet (February).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Evaluation of history: Demand is stable (P1: 671, P2: 673, past demands: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]). Mean demand is approx 686. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Orders placed in P1 (808) and P2 (793) are in-transit (total 1601). Note: inventory is currently 0 with lost sales occurring because lead time of 4 means the first arrival (P1 order) won't occur until P1+4=P5 resolution (visible at P6). We must set parameters to bridge the gap until then. mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for demand statistics to capture the most recent stability.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. History shows demands [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] prior to the start and [671, 673, 539] during the first three periods. The mean demand is approximately 666 units per period. Promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (P1+4), and will be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at P6 start). Since we have no completed lead time data yet, I will use L=4. My primary concern is the current zero on-hand inventory; however, there are 2376 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). mu_hat should reflect the demand over (L+1) periods. Using the mean of all available 8 samples (~666), mu_hat should be around 3330 for explicit setting or simply use the default calculation across all samples. Given the consistent demand pattern, I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical context while we wait for the first arrival.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU 706016001 (high-waisted denim) has a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. No units have arrived yet, which is expected as the first order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 and will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 3166 units. Historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447] averages around 642 units per period, but recent demand (last 2 periods) has shown a dip (539 and 447). Given the early stage and the fact that we are awaiting the first promised arrival, I will stick to the default lead time. For demand forecasting, the full history average is stable, but as we are entering mid-March (spring/transitional fashion), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture more recent fluctuations while the OR backend manages safety stock to cover the review+lead period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 for a high-waisted skinny denim SKU. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming actual lead time (L) is 4. Currently, we have 340 units on hand and 2,538 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Historical demand data shows [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] prior to the game, and [671, 673, 539, 447, 468] during the game. There is a visible downward shift in demand starting around Period 3/4, likely seasonal as we move further into March. The mean demand of the last 3 periods (P3, P4, P5) is approximately 485, compared to the earlier average of ~680. I will prioritize recent demand (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this lower demand regime to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: average demand decreased from ~680 to ~485 (-29%). Observed lead time confirmed at 4 periods in Period 5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a distinct demand shift starting around Period 3. Initial demand samples (including pre-game history) averaged ~680, but the last four samples (P3-P6) are [539, 447, 468, 502], averaging ~489. This represents a ~28% drop. Regarding lead time, we have confirmed L=4 through two consecutive arrivals (P5 and P6). The system currently has 631 units on-hand and 1745 in pipeline. To calibrate for the new demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods, I will set L to 'default' (4), and use 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime observed since Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1149.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we are managing SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) in early April. We have stabilized after the initial stocking phase (first 4 periods had 0 sales due to lead time). Significant findings: 1) Actual lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (matches promised). 2) A demand regime shift occurred around Period 3; initial demand averaged ~680 (P1-P2), but has since dropped and remained stable at an average of 493.4 units (P3-P7). Currently, on-hand inventory (895) plus in-transit (1115) equals 2010 units. With an expected demand of ~500/period and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) is roughly 2500 units. To reach this, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for L. The OR backend's service level (75-80%) will balance against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) shows a stabilized demand regime following a shift in Period 3. Since P3, demand has averaged approximately 508 units ([539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560] / 6), a significant decrease from the early pre-launch/launch peaks (~680). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). With 1125 units on-hand and 851 in-transit, current pipeline inventory is 1976 units. Based on a 5-period horizon (L+1), expected demand is ~2540. However, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the actual order size. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand stability and 'calculate' for L as the 4-period lead time is now well-established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $370.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) shows a demand regime that shifted around Period 3/4. The initial demand (Periods 1-2) averaged ~672, while the most recent 7 periods (Periods 3-9) averaged 483, though Period 9 showed a notably lower demand of 335. The carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by 5 consecutive arrivals (Periods 5-9). Currently, on-hand inventory is 970 and in-transit is 1246 (total pipeline 2216). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Assuming an average demand of ~480, required coverage is ~2400 units. The pipeline is slightly below this. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand levels accurately, and use calculate for lead time as it has been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) shows a significant downward trend in demand. Starting around Period 3/4, mean demand dropped from ~680 to ~485, and in the most recent two periods (P9-P10), demand has dropped further to 335 and 269 respectively. This suggests a secondary shift or a fading seasonal trend as we move further into spring. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9. No arrival was recorded in Period 10 because the order from Period 6 was 0 units. On-hand inventory (701) and in-transit (1573) are currently high relative to the recent demand levels. To prevent overstocking during this decline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend while staying responsive, and L=4 based on historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: average demand slowed further from ~490 to ~300 (-38%) over the last two periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has shown a clear declining trend. After an initial drop at Period 3 (avg ~485), demand further decelerated at Period 9 to an average of ~288 over the last three periods (335, 269, 261). As we are in late April (Spring/Summer transition), this specific denim weight or style may be losing seasonal momentum. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 1510 units is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) given the current mean (~288 * 5 = 1440). We have 585 on-hand. We need to set parameters to prevent over-ordering while maintaining safety stock for the current lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent local mean of ~288 and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~490 to ~288 (-41%) based on the last 3 periods (P9-P11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. We are in early May. Analysis of the historical demand shows a significant downward shift starting around Period 9. The demand from P1-P5 averaged ~550, decreased to ~500 in P6-P8, and has since fallen further. Recent demand (P9-P12) is 335, 269, 261, and 339, averaging approximately 301 units. This decline is confirmed and sustained. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the arrival data for P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11, and P12. The current inventory position is high: On-hand = 772, In-transit = 984 (total 1756). Based on the current demand rate of ~300, 1756 units covers nearly 6 periods of supply, which is more than the (L+1) = 5 period target. We should use recent_N with N=4 to capture the localized lower demand regime (P9-P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L remains default at 4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a lower-demand regime starting from Period 9, coinciding with the transition from early spring into mid-May. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 289 units (335, 269, 261, 339, 241), which is a significant drop from the 450-550 range seen in early spring. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed arrivals (P9 order arrived in P13). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 1106 units, and the pipeline contains 409 units (ordered in P10 and P11). Given the current demand rate and lead time (L=4), the total inventory coverage needed for (L+1) periods (5 periods) at the current mean is approximately 1445 units. The existing inventory (1106 on-hand + 409 in-transit = 1515) already covers this, so the OR backend will likely order zero or minimal units to keep costs low. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-demand regime and prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: sustained lower demand average of 289 units (+/- 40 units) observed over last 5 periods (P9-P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand as we move into late May. The average demand has shifted twice: first around P3 (decreasing from ~680 to ~490) and more significantly around P9. For the last 6 periods (P9-P14), the average demand is 272 units, with the most recent sample (P14) dropping further to 189 units. This decline is likely seasonal as we move away from typical spring denim peaks. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P11, P12, P13, and P14). Current on-hand inventory is 1244 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (sufficient for over 4 weeks of stock at current mean demand). Pipeline inventory is 97 units (orders from P11 and P14). To avoid escalating holding costs while respecting the service level target, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the lower late-spring demand regime (mean of P9-P14 is 272). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: sustained lower demand average of 272 units observed over last 6 periods (P9-P14), with a potential further deceleration noted in Period 14 (189 units).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P9-P15) has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 283 units per period. The most recent demand (P15) was 375, which is higher than the previous few weeks but still fits the overall recent regime compared to the early periods (600+). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 951 units, which covers over 3 periods of demand at the current rate (283 * 3.36 = 951), and there are 144 units remaining in-transit (orders from P14 and P15). Given the holding cost is $1/unit and profit is $4/unit, the backend should targeting a base stock level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (P9 onwards). This will allow the OR backend to realize that current inventory + pipeline is sufficient, thus minimizing further orders and holding costs while maintaining a safe buffer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lower demand regime (P9-P15) average confirmed at 283 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17 (2019/6/3). The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown significant volatility recently. After a prolonged lower regime (avg ~283), Period 16 saw a sharp spike to 533 units. Looking at the June date, this likely represents a summer seasonal shift or promotional event. The on-hand inventory is currently 418, with 539 in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp increase in Period 16, I am adjusting the demand forecast upward using a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture this momentum while balancing it against the previous lower average. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to meet this rising demand without over-ordering excessively if it's a short spike. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/Seasonal spike: Period 16 demand (533) is nearly double the previous 7-period average (283), suggesting a summer seasonal increase starting June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is entering a high-demand summer phase. Period 16 (demand: 533) and Period 17 (demand: 451) show a significant increase compared to the previous regime (avg ~280). We are currently stocked out (Ending On-hand: 0) with demand exceeding supply in Period 17. The actual lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods across historical arrivals. Because we are at a seasonal turning point (June), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to focus on this new higher-demand trend, while using a slightly broader N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this transition. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well established in the history.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: Demand jumped from ~280 avg (P9-P15) to ~492 avg (P16-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is currently experiencing a summer seasonal peak that began around Period 16 (late May/early June). Current demand has shifted from a previous low-regime average of ~283 to a significantly higher average of ~482 over the last three periods (P16: 533, P17: 451, P18: 462). This seasonal spike has led to a complete stockout (ending inventory 0 for two consecutive periods) because previous orders were based on the lower demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have a clear, sustained upward regime shift coinciding with the summer calendar, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the current high-demand period while accounting for the inventory delay (L=4).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: Demand jumped from ~280 avg (P9-P15) to ~482 avg (P16-P18). Stockouts occurring due to regime transition.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer seasonal peak that began around Period 16 (late May). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 451 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime (~280). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods) because orders placed before the surge were too small. The 'In-transit' balance of 2222 units includes orders from P16 (395), P17 (649), P18 (622), and P19 (556). The lead time is stable at 4 periods, meaning the P16 order (395 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (P20), which should alleviate the stockout. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the next (L+1=5) periods during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime, and L using the established lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak established (P16-P19): demand average increased to 451 units/period (+60% vs. P9-P15 average of 283). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) enters Period 21 (July 1st). The summer seasonal peak observed from P16-P19 (avg ~450) saw a significant drop in P20 (265 units). July often marks the end of peak spring/summer fashion retail and the beginning of clearance cycles, which may explain the softening demand. I am setting N=5 for mu_hat (P16-P20) to capture the seasonal regime while weighting the recent drop (mean of last 5 is ~414). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have very high pipeline inventory (1996 units), setting L=4, mu_hat with N=5, and sigma_hat with N=5 will allow the OR backend's capped base-stock policy to prevent excessive over-ordering while maintaining service levels if demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in Period 20 (265 units) following the early summer peak (P16-P19 avg 451). Transition from peak summer demand to late summer/early fall regime may be occurring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (706016001) is currently in a state of fluctuation following a summer peak (P16-P19 avg: 451). Period 20 showed a significant drop to 265, but Period 21 rebounded to 353. The average of the last two periods (P20-P21) is 309, which is a marked deceleration from the peak but remains higher than the spring regime (avg: 283). Given the current date (July 8), we are likely entering a mid-to-late summer phase where demand stabilizes at a level slightly below the initial June peak. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 426 units on-hand and 1,486 units in-transit (covering orders from P18-P21), we are well-stocked for the near term. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the full summer profile (P16-P21), which averages approximately 404 units/period, providing a buffer against stockouts while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand stabilization: Following the early summer peak (P16-P19), demand in P20-P21 has averaged 309 units/period, a -31% decrease from the peak but higher than previous regimes.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waisted denim trouser (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Analysis of recent periods indicates a transition from the early summer peak (P16-P19, avg ~451) to a mid-summer stabilization phase. Demand in P20-P22 has been 265, 353, and 393, averaging approximately 337 units. This is lower than the June peak but significantly higher than the spring low of 272 (P9-P14). The current date (July 15) suggests we are in the heart of the summer season where demand is likely to remain relatively stable before any late-summer clearance or fall transition. Pipeline inventory is high (1152 units), including orders placed during the peak-demand panic. However, arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (consistent W=4 in recent concludes). To avoid overstocking as demand cools from its peak, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) which capture the current 'stabilized' summer demand level (avg ~337). This reflects the most recent trend while acknowledging the jump from the spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P22) stabilized at approximately 337 units/period, down from the June peak (451) but up from the spring average (272). Lead time remains reliably 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is currently in a stabilized mid-summer demand regime (Period 20-23). After a significant early summer peak (P16-P19) where demand averaged ~451 units, the last four periods have shown a lower, consistent demand average of 345 units (265, 353, 393, 369). The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods based on a long history of consistent arrivals. Given the current on-hand inventory of 842 and in-transit units of 598 (Total pipeline = 1440), and an expected demand over the (L+1=5) period horizon of approximately 1725 units, maintaining a base stock level that reflects this recent stabilization is appropriate. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak regime (P20-P23), ensuring we don't over-order based on the June spike while still maintaining enough safety stock for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P23) consolidated at an average of 345 units/period, following the June peak (avg 451). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has transitioned from its June summer peak (~450 units/period) into a mid-summer demand regime. For the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has stabilized at an average of 322 units (265, 353, 393, 369, 232). The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. With current on-hand inventory at 779 units and 820 units in-transit (total 1599), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent mid-summer regime, while maintaining L at the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P24) consolidated at an average of 322 units/period, down from the June peak (451). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Jade HW Skinny Denim (Period 20-25) indicates a stable mid-summer regime following the early summer peak. The demand values are [265, 353, 393, 369, 232, 298], resulting in an average of approximately 318 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 64 units. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P20 and P21 orders arriving at P24 and P25 respectively). I am using recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-peak stabilization. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current rate (~1590 units), effectively balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P25) stabilized at an average of 318 units/period, down from the June peak (451) but showing consistent behavior over 6 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a mid-summer demand regime following a June peak. Since Period 20 (7 periods), demand has averaged 327 units per period (P20: 265, P21: 353, P22: 393, P23: 369, P24: 232, P25: 298, P26: 381), which is slightly higher than the spring average but significantly lower than the June peak (451). This regime appears stable. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P21-P26 from orders placed in P17-P22). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed stable lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand mean within this specific post-peak regime (avg ~327). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the variance of this current period accurately. This strategy ensures the base stock stays aligned with recent sales speed while maintaining a buffer against the moderate volatility observed in the last 7 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P20-P26) stabilized at an average of 327 units/period. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1936.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 27 (493) spiked significantly above the recent 'mid-summer' average (P20-P26 avg: ~327). This suggests a possible 'Back to School' late-August surge, fitting for denim trousers. In Period 28, we observe 36 units on-hand with a large pipeline (1226). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the spike in P27, I will use a shorter window (recent_N where N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this upward movement proactively while relying on the OR backend's inventory balancing. This allows the system to adjust for the higher demand signal (avg of P25-P27 is ~390) compared to the previous regime.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand spike detected: Period 27 demand (493) is ~50% higher than the P20-P26 average (327).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1708.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is entering a high-demand period likely driven by back-to-school shopping (late August). Period 27 demand (493) and Period 28 demand (432) show a significant increase compared to the previous mid-summer average of ~327. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and relied on an arrival of 391 units in P28 to satisfy demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and stockout risk, I am forecasting a higher mu_hat to account for this new regime. I'll use the average of the last 2 periods (~462) as the baseline for the forecast. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*forecast = 5*462.5 = 2312.5. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime confirmed (P27-P28): average demand increased to ~463 units/period (+41% vs. P20-P26 average of 327).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data (P27-P29) confirms a 'Back-to-School' demand regime shift. Demand has spiked from a mid-summer average of 327 to an average of 440 units/period over the last 3 weeks (493, 432, 396). The product (High-waisted skinny denim) is highly relevant for the fall transition. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P28 and P29, though significant in-transit stock (1797) is expected to arrive starting next period (P30). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this elevated demand regime accurately and ensure the base stock calculation reflects the higher throughput needed to satisfy the fall spike while avoiding excessive stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime confirmed (P27-P29): average demand increased to 440 units/period (+35% vs. P20-P26 average of 327).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a high-demand late summer/back-to-school phase. Period 30 demand (740) was a massive spike, significantly exceeding the already elevated back-to-school average (periods 27-29 avg: 440). This indicates either a peak week or a shift to a higher-velocity regime (September demand). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but total in-transit is high (2029 units). The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival history (P26 order arrived P30). Given the stockout and the accelerating demand trend, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the back-to-school regime (P27-P30 avg: 515), which will significantly lift the order quantity to ensure future demand is met while accounting for the current stockout. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in the recent period.

Carry-over insight: High-velocity back-to-school demand regime confirmed (P27-P30): average demand increased to 515 units/period, with a significant peak of 740 units observed in Period 30.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a high-demand regime, which transitioned during late August (Period 27), likely driven by back-to-school and fall fashion trends. The last five periods (P27-P31) show a sharp increase in demand, averaging 553.8 units/period (493, 432, 396, 740, 708), compared to the mid-summer average of ~327. The most recent two periods (P30-P31) specifically show very high velocity (>700 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline is being utilized to keep up with this surge. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime. This provides a mean of ~554 units/period across the lead time + review period (L+1=5), ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current 2019/9/16 demand context.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall demand regime (starting P27) has further intensified. The average demand for P27-P31 is 554 units/period (+69% vs. P20-P26 average of 327), with the most recent two periods (P30-P31) exceeding 700 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a high-velocity 'Back-to-School/Fall' regime that started around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand has intensified significantly, with the last three periods (P30-P32) recorded at 740, 708, and 707 units respectively. The average for this regime (P27-P32) is approximately 580 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, although a large pipeline of 2518 units exists. Given the current date (Sept 23), this high demand is likely sustained through the fall season. To prevent further stockouts while inventory is in transit, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full extent of this higher demand regime (P27-P32), which averages 579 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to reflect the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 152) seen during this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Fall demand regime (P27-P32) confirmed with a high sustained average of 579 units/period, roughly double the mid-summer average.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has exploded in Period 33, reaching 1,428 units\u2014nearly triple the average of the already high-velocity 'back-to-school' regime (avg ~579). This massive spike on Sept 23rd suggests the transition into a peak fall/winter retail season or a major promotional event. We are currently experiencing severe stockouts (ending on-hand is 0) despite large in-transit volumes. The current demand is a clear outlier compared to the previous regime (P27-P32), so a very narrow recent_N window is needed to capture this momentum while acknowledging that 1,428 might be an extreme peak. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent 700+ and 1400+ observations heavily. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak fall demand detected: Period 33 demand reached 1,428 units, a 146% increase over the P27-P32 average (579). Regime is now characterized by extreme volatility and high volume.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has entered a super-peak fall demand regime. Demand in Period 33 reached 1,428 followed by 748 in Period 34. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 866 units, which is a massive jump from the previous back-to-school average. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and the pipeline needs to be aggressive to catch up to this new level, even with the internal order cap. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this high-volume regime while acknowledging the extreme spike in P33. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 will force the base stock level up to account for the current high-velocity demand and the increased volatility observed in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak fall demand regime confirmed (P30-P34): average demand jumped to 866 units/period, driven by a massive spike of 1,428 units in P33. Ongoing stockouts since P28 indicate persistent under-forecasting relative to this seasonal surge.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering mid-October (Period 36), historically a high-velocity period for 'High-waisted jeans' as cooler weather sets in. Recent history (P30-P35) confirms a 'Super-peak' regime with demand averaging 773 units/period (740, 708, 707, 1428, 748, 606). While P33 was an extreme outlier (1428), the floor of this regime is established around 600-750 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My priority is to maintain 5 periods of cover (L+1) to prevent the recurring stockouts observed between P28 and P34. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume, high-volatility regime (P30-P35), which correctly reflects the current fall demand levels while smoothing the massive P33 outlier's effect on safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Super-peak fall demand regime (starting P30) average confirmed at 773 units/period. Period 33 (1428) is a significant high-side outlier in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 is currently in a high-velocity Fall/Post-Back-to-School regime that began around Period 30. While Period 33 was an extreme outlier (1,428 units), the most recent two periods (P35-P36) have stabilized at a lower but still elevated level (avg 594 units) compared to historical averages. The transition from the massive spike back to a more consistent high-demand state suggests using a recent window that captures this stabilization. I will use recent_N=7 to cover the entire post-spike regime (P30-P36), which averages approximately 773 units/period, providing a conservative buffer against the recurring stockouts seen throughout September. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (e.g., P32 order arriving in P36).

Carry-over insight: Super-peak fall demand regime (starting P30) average stabilized at ~773 units/period, following the P33 outlier. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 is currently in a high-velocity Fall/Back-to-school regime that began around Period 27. While Period 33 was an extreme outlier (1,428 units), the demand has since stabilized over the last four periods (P34-P37) at an average of 644.5 units (748, 606, 581, 643). The in-transit pipeline is very large (3,536 units) following high orders placed in P34 and P35 to recover from stockouts. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P34-P37) to capture the stabilized high-demand level while moving past the P33 spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to account for the volatility inherent in this high-demand season without being overly skewed by the single P33 outlier. This approach manages the high service level requirements of the current regime while respecting the large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-school demand regime (starting P27) has stabilized at approximately 645 units/period over the last 4 periods (P34-P37), moving past the outlier spike of P33.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has entered a stable fall regime following the extreme volatility seen in September (P30-P33). Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 648 units/period, significantly lower than the P33 spike (1428) but much higher than the summer average. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P34 order in P38. Currently, there is a healthy on-hand inventory of 1,125 units and a large pipeline of 2,056 units (primarily from P35-P37 orders). Since the pipeline plus on-hand already exceeds (L+1) * current_mean (5 * 648 = 3240), the system correctly placed a zero order in P38. To maintain this stability and avoid overstocking as we move into November, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5), which captures the post-spike fall average (approx. 648) while ignoring the extreme outlier of Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-school demand regime (starting P27) has stabilized at approximately 648 units/period over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), confirming a move past the P33 outlier spike.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has transitioned from the 'super-peak' fall period into a late-fall stabilization phase. Over the last five periods (P35-P39), demand has averaged 596 units, with the most recent observation at 485 units, suggesting a cooling trend from the mid-autumn highs. We have successfully replenished inventory following a period of stockouts, with 1,946 units on hand and 931 in-transit. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of P35 orders in P39). To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the stabilized demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering P34-P39) to capture the post-outlier average (~612 units/period). This provides a balanced forecast for the next (L+1) periods (5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current period's lower volatility compared to the P33 outlier phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak fall stabilization confirmed: Demand (P35-P39) has stabilized at an average of 596 units/period, down from the P30-P34 average of 866 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized post-peak-fall. Over the last six periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged 593 units. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) show a slight cooling with an average of 576 units. We are currently in mid-November (2019/11/18). Looking at on-hand inventory (1728) and in-transit units (962), our total pipeline inventory is 2690. Given the expected demand of ~600 units per period and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1), which is approximately 3000 units. My current pipeline (2690) is slightly below this, but given the recent deceleration, a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 will capture the post-peak stabilization. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak fall demand stabilization (P35-P40) confirmed at an average of 593 units per period, consistently lower than the P30-P34 super-peak avg of 866 units.

The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has transitioned into a post-peak fall stabilization phase. After the extreme volatility and spikes reaching 1,428 units in September (Period 33), the demand over the last 7 periods (P35-P41) has averaged ~586 units/period (606, 581, 643, 663, 485, 581, 547). The standard deviation in this specific regime is relatively low compared to the super-peak period. Current On-hand inventory (1,568) plus In-transit (969) totals 2,537 units. With a promised and confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At an average of 586 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 2,930 units. We are currently slightly below this target. Setting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 captures this current stable regime while excluding the high-side outlier of Period 33. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the stabilized volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (4), as arrivals continue to be consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak fall demand regime (P35-P41) confirmed at an average of 586 units/period, showing significant stability after the P33 outlier spike.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a massive demand spike of 3,100 units, significantly exceeding all previous levels, including the P33 spike of 1,428. This aligns with Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak retail demand for denim. My previous forecasting for Period 43 (Dec 2) failed to account for this magnitude, resulting in a stockout. While 3,100 might be a peak outlier, demand in early December usually remains high until Christmas. On-hand is currently 0, with 1,478 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the large orders from P38-P41 (combined ~969 units) are still arriving. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect a sustained 'Holiday/Peak' average of 850 units per period (acknowledging the 3,100 spike but tempering it to avoid massive overstocks if it was a single-day event). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 500 to account for extreme volatility seen in P33 and P42. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday super-peak detected: Period 42 demand reached 3,100 units, a 420% increase over the P35-P41 average (586). The regime is now defined by extreme seasonal volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $724.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 (3,100) and Period 43 (674) represents the Black Friday/Cyber Monday super-peak cycle. Historically, this SKU (high-waisted skinny denim) sees massive spikes followed by a secondary stabilization or 'Holiday gift' regime leading into late December. Period 42's demand was a 420% increase over the previous 7-period average (586). While demand dropped in Period 43 to 674, it remains significantly higher than the pre-peak fall average. Based on the 2019 calendar (current date Dec 9), we are entering the peak holiday shopping weeks. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand volatility (sigma) and the need to prevent further stockouts during this critical sales window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-Black Friday elevated level (avg ~1,440) and sigmat_hat using recent_N=9 to encompass the massive variance of the holiday spike. This should bias the OR engine toward holding sufficient stock for the December peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday super-peak confirmed (P42-43): Extremes reached 3,100 units; average during this 2-period window is ~1,887, significantly higher than the fall average of 586 (+220%).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Period 45). Demand has shown extreme seasonal volatility with a massive 'Black Friday' spike of 3,100 units in Period 42. While demand in Periods 43 and 44 (674 and 680 units) appears lower, these figures were constrained by stockouts (sold = on-hand), meaning true latent demand is significantly higher. Given the date (Dec 16), we must prepare for the final holiday surge and potential post-holiday returns/sales. The 'Black Friday' period (P42-P44) average demand is approximately 1,484 units. I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting this high-velocity regime to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both current stockouts and upcoming demand, while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday super-peak regime (starting P42) latent demand estimated at ~1,500 units/period, significantly exceeding on-hand supply. Actual sales in P43-P44 (674, 680) are supply-constrained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1576.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday/Christmas season (Date: 2019/12/23). In Period 42 (Black Friday), demand spiked to 3,100 units. Demand since then (P43-P45) has been supply-constrained, with sales capped by the small arrivals of old orders (394 units). Total latent demand is estimated to be significantly higher than current sales, likely between 1,500 and 2,500 units given the 'Holiday super-peak' context and previous year's trends for skinny denim during cold months. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is high (7,602 units) due to massive orders placed in P43-P45 to catch the holiday surge. These large orders (1,673, 2,816, 2,604) are expected to arrive in P47, P48, and P49 respectively. For Period 46, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 7,500 to reflect the 5-period (L+1) requirement during this high-volume window (averaging 1,500/period). Sigma_hat is set to 2,000 to account for extreme holiday volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Holiday super-peak latent demand estimated at ~1,500-2,000 units/period (P43-P45 sales were supply-constrained at ~670 units). Massive replenishment pipeline (7.6k units) created to cover year-end volume.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday/end-of-year period (Dec 30). Demand had spiked significantly around late November/early December (P42 demand 3,100), and while recent sales (P43-P45) were supply-constrained, P46 actual demand (475) suggests the hyper-peak is subsiding towards a post-holiday level. However, given the extreme volatility of the last regime and the product's high-waisted skinny denim nature, we must maintain a robust stock position for potential New Year's sales or early spring transitions. A massive in-transit pipeline of 8,675 units is already arriving, stemming from aggressive orders in P43-P46. Lead time has been remarkably stable at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P42-P46) to capture the elevated but declining holiday average (approx 1,117 units/period) while the OR backend's cap mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering as the pipeline arrives. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' to account for the massive variance observed during the Black Friday peak (3,100 vs 475).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration: P46 demand (475) confirms a shift away from the 1,500+ unit latent demand estimated during the Dec peak, though demand remains higher than early autumn levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
