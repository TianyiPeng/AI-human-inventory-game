Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser (Divided Collection). Given historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], the mean demand is approximately 688.8 units and the standard deviation is approximately 72.8. No lead-time history is available yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 4 periods. The goal is to cover demand for the review period plus the lead time (1+4=5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent level of demand while ensuring the OR backend has enough data to calculate base stock levels. The promised lead time is 4, which is the baseline until observations suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 808 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected for L=4, nothing arrived in Period 1 (visible at start of Period 2). The demand in Period 1 was 671, which fits the historical range [576-774]. The current on-hand is 0, and we have one shipment of 808 in transit. Since this is only the second period and we have no observed deliveries yet to challenge the promised lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 5 pre-game samples plus the Period 1 observation) to capture the most relevant recent demand behavior without overreacting to a single point. The product is skinny denim, which typically has stable demand, and there are no immediate major holidays in mid-February to suggest a drastic shift yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple item. Initial inventory was 0, and we have placed two orders (808 in P1, 804 in P2) for a total of 1612 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in P1 with L=4 arrives during the arrival resolution phase of P5 and is visible at the start of P6. Consequently, no arrivals are expected yet. Demand for the last 5 periods (including historical data provided) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673]. The mean of all 7 available samples is approximately 684. The demand is relatively stable with no clear seasonal spike or regime shift detected in the first two periods of the live simulation. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), 'default' for mu_hat (using all available history), and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a balanced service level as we wait for the initial pipe-fill to arrive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a staple item. Initial observed demand (past 5 samples plus game history) is consistently high (mean approx 670). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a pipeline of 2,394 units. Looking at the history, shipments from Period 1 (808 units), Period 2 (804 units), and Period 3 (782 units) are still in transit. Given the promised lead time L=4, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, current zero visibility of arrivals is expected and does not yet signal a delay or loss. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and recent demand history (N=5 including the 3 game periods and the 2 most recent pre-game samples [715, 774]) to set parameters. This N captures the most recent demand levels (approx 680/period).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard fashion item. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 (placed in P1's decision phase) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Therefore, we expect the first arrival to be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which we will read at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units ordered are in-transit (808+804+782+817 = 3211). Demand has shown a slight downward trend over the last 4 periods (671, 673, 539, 447) following historical demand (694, 576, 685, 715, 774). However, with only 4 periods of game history, we should be cautious about assuming a permanent shift. Since no orders have reached their promised lead time yet, we stick to the promised 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, we use the average of the game history data (4 periods) to capture the recent trend while acknowledging the early stage of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1532.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is accurate (Order from P1 arrived in P5 resolution phase, $5-1=4$). Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' started high (~670-700) but has dropped significantly in the last three weeks (539, 447, 468), averaging 484.6. This looks like a regime shift or a post-launch stabilization. Pipeline inventory is currently very high (2403 units), consisting of orders from P2 (804), P3 (782), and P4 (817). Given the current demand trend (~485 units/period) and lead time (L=4), the desired base stock (for L+1=5 periods) should be around 2425 units. We already have 340 on-hand plus 2403 in-transit, totaling 2743, which well exceeds the needed pipeline coverage. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the lower demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent lower volatility. For L, I will use the established calculated lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: average weekly demand decreased from ~680 to ~485 (-28%) across the last 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. History confirms a significant demand drop starting around Period 3. Prior to Period 3, demand was ~671-673; since Period 3, demand has averaged ~489 (447, 468, 502, 539). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 and 6. Currently, we have 642 units on-hand and 1599 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and potentially P5/P6 if any were placed). Given the inventory buildup from recent arrivals (P1 and P2 orders) and the lower demand regime, we need to adjust mu_hat to reflect the recent average to avoid excessive overstocking. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stable, lower demand regime (Avg ~489).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1131.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Historical demand data shows two distinct phases: Periods 1-2 averaged ~680, followed by a significant drop starting in Period 3. For the last 5 periods (P3-P7), demand has stabilized at an average of 493.4 (539, 447, 468, 502, 511). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume regime while ignoring the initial high-demand spikes. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, and P3, so I will use the 'calculate' method for L. Current On-hand (913) and In-transit (1097, originating from P4 and P7) provide sufficient coverage for the next few periods, but the OR backend needs these parameters to maintain the base stock level under the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 3-7 average demand is 493, confirming a ~27% decrease from the initial period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1070.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 3-8) shows a stabilized regime with an average of approximately 505 units per period. The initial high demand seen in Periods 1-2 (~672) has not repeated. Lead time appears stable at the promised 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently high (1170) plus in-transit (806 from P7 and P8), totaling 1976 units. This is significantly higher than the expected (L+1) demand of ~2525 (505 * 5), providing safety but approaching the cap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (Periods 3-8) and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $505.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation period is P10. Product is skinny denim trousers. Expected lead time is 4. Historical analysis: Orders from P1 through P4 have arrived exactly with lead time L=4. The P5 and P6 orders (zero orders) had no arrival to track. The P7 order (placed P7) is expected to arrive in P11 resolution. The demand profile shows a shift starting P3. Initial demands (P-4 to P2) were high (approx 680). From P3 onwards, demand dropped: [539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560, 335]. The average of these last 7 periods is approx 480. Period 9 specifically saw a sharp drop to 335, which might be a fluctuation or a further downward trend, but for setting parameters, the recent_N (N=7) captures the post-shift regime well. Given the stable observed lead time of 4 periods, I will stick with L=4. \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 will use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current lower-demand regime while filtering out the noise of the high-demand periods at the start.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on P5-P8 arrivals (Orders from P1-P4 arrived exactly in L=4). Demand regime remains stable around avg 480 since P3 (7 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (706016001) has shown a further decline over the last two periods (P9: 335, P10: 269), significantly lower than the P3-P8 average of ~480. This suggests a potential new regime shift or seasonal cooling post-Easter (April 21 was Easter 2019, and P10 was the week ending April 21). The average demand over the last 8 periods (since P3) is roughly 454, but the last 3 periods average 388. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on history, though P9 and P10 saw 0 arrivals because 0 units were ordered in P5 and P6. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to account for the sustained lower demand since Period 3, and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this lower regime. Setting L to calculate matches the observed stable lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased further from ~480 to ~388 (-19%) over the last 3 periods (P8-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant and sustained downward trend. After an initial drop at Period 3 (averaging ~480), demand has fallen further since Period 9. The last three periods (P9-P11) have seen demands of 335, 269, and 261, respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 288.33. This represents a further ~40% decrease from the previous regime. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Currently, on-hand inventory (585) plus in-transit stock (1616) is very high (2201 units) relative to this new demand level. With approximately 7-8 periods of supply already in the pipeline (at current demand rates), the goal is to lower the base stock level to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to quickly adjust the OR engine to this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from ~480 to ~288 (-40%) across the last 3 periods (P9-P11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim trousers) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand. After an initial drop at P3, a second significant drop occurred at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The average demand for the most recent regime (P9-P12) is approximately 301 units, compared to the previous regime's ~480. We are now in May, and the demand for washed superstretch denim appears to be stabilizing at this lower level. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (L=4). Inventory levels are currently high (772 on-hand) due to previous orders arriving while demand was dropping. My parameters are set to reflect this new lower demand regime using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the shift and avoid overstocking while maintaining a 4-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: average weekly demand decreased from ~480 to ~301 (-37%) over the last 4 periods (P9-P12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand. The latest demand regime shift began at Period 9 (early April), with weekly demand dropping from an average of ~480 to ~289 over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). This aligns with a potential seasonal exit for this specific denim wash or style as temperatures rise in May. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P11-P13 arrivals all confirmed L=4). On-hand inventory is high (1106 units) relative to the current lower demand (avg ~289), covering nearly 4 weeks of demand. With 515 units still in-transit from orders placed in P10-P11, the total pipeline is approximately 1621 units. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the $4 profit, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (Period 9 onwards).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: average weekly demand decreased from ~480 to ~289 (-40%) over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-488.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim TRS (trousers), and we are in mid-May (Period 15). Demand has shown two distinct downward shifts: first at Period 3 (averaging ~480) and a more significant one starting at Period 9. The last 6 periods (P9-P14) show demands of [335, 269, 261, 339, 241, 189], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 272. lead_time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 1244 units, which is quite high (it would cover over 4 weeks of the current demand rate). There is 188 units in-transit from Period 11, which will arrive in next period's resolution phase. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low demand regime (approx 272/period), I will use the recent N=6 method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand state and prevent over-ordering while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: average weekly demand decreased to ~272 (-43% from P3-P8 avg) over the last 6 periods (P9-P14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a sustained lower demand regime that began around Period 9. The most recent demand (P15) was 375, which is higher than the previous few weeks but still fits within the volatile downward trend observed since spring. Demand across P9-P15 averages approximately 287 units/period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals from P7 through P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 1057 units, which covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the current average rate (1057/287). Pipeline inventory is very low (38 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the demand regime since Period 9. sigma_hat is set to default to ensure the OR backend captures the true historical volatility of this SKU, which has seen significant shifts. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently realized.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is showing a significant reversal in demand trend. After a steady decline from Period 9 (averaging ~272), demand surged in Period 15 (375) and spiked to 533 in Period 16 (June 3rd). This likely corresponds to the beginning of the summer retail season for denim trousers or a specific promotion. The 'Period 9-14' low-demand regime is no longer relevant. I am shifting the forecasting focus to the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) to capture this upward momentum while acknowledging historical volatility. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the full game history. The on-hand inventory (524) and in-transit (620) are relatively low compared to the renewed demand level (533 per period), so I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat upwards to prevent stockouts during this potential summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Demand increased significantly from a low-base avg of ~272 to 533 (+95%) over the last 2 periods, signaling a seasonal or trend reversal.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P15-P17) shows a significant rebound, shifting from a low of ~272 to an average of 453 units per period (+66%). This aligns with late spring/early summer seasonality for 'High-waisted jeans' which can see renewed interest as people update their summer wardrobes. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P11-P15 arrivals). Inventory is currently very low (on-hand 73) relative to recent demand (451), though pipeline inventory is quite high (1269 units). To avoid stockouts while catching the new upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current demand level (~453 per period), ensuring the base stock level (1+L=5 periods) reflects this new regime while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive ordering against the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: demand increased from ~272 to ~453 over the last 3 periods (P15-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) as of the end of Period 18, with a stock-out occurring where only 73 units were sold against a demand of 462. A clear demand regime shift started at Period 15, changing the average weekly demand from ~272 to ~455 over the last 4 periods (P15-P18: 375, 533, 451, 462). This increase corresponds with the transition into June (summer season for denim jeans). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed up to Period 15 arrival). However, there are no arrivals scheduled until Period 19 or 20 (from the P15 order). The pipeline (In-transit: 1852) includes orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18. To account for the recent demand surge and prevent further stock-outs once arrivals resume, I will use recent_N with N=4 (capturing the P15-P18 regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current higher demand level of ~455 per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~272 to ~455 (+67%) over the last 4 periods (P15-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) is currently experiencing a demand regime shift that began around Period 15, moving from a low of ~272 units to a higher average of ~455 units (+67%) over the last 5 periods (P15-P19). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods (P18 and P19). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). To account for the recent demand surge and restore stock levels, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean (~435 across P15-P19), and sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to reflect current volatility. This will increase the base stock level to satisfy the current demand trend while factoring in the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: Average demand stabilized at ~435 units (+60% from previous low regime) over the last 5 periods (P15-P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $743.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has transitioned into a higher regime starting around Period 15, likely tied to summer seasonality or a fashion trend reversal. Over the last 6 periods (P15-P20), the average demand is approximately 407 units (375, 533, 451, 462, 358, 265). Although Period 20 saw a dip to 265, the preceding five periods were significantly higher. I am setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and higher average demand compared to the spring lows. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P19 and P20). Pipeline inventory is currently bolstered by significant orders placed between P17 and P19 (approx 1778 units in transit), which should start arriving in P21 and P22 to resolve the current stockout/low-stock situation seen in P18-P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: Average demand over P15-P20 is ~407 units, representing a sustained increase from the ~272 average of the previous low-demand regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a demand regime that stabilized around Period 15. Over the last 7 periods (P15-P21), the average demand is approximately 400 units, which is a significant recovery from the mid-spring low of ~270 units but lower than the initial ~680 units seen in February. We are now in July (summer season), and the demand has shown some volatility recently with a drop to 265 in P20 followed by 353 in P21. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 613 with a robust pipeline of 1249 units. The goal is to set parameters that maintain a high service level for this current demand level (avg ~400) while preventing overstocking as we exit the peak summer weeks. I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P15-P21) to capture this most recent stable regime for both mean and variance calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 stabilized: average demand for P15-P21 is 399.7 (~400) units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has stabilized after a significant recovery starting around Period 15. Analysis of the current demand regime (P15 to P22) shows an average demand of approximately 400 units, significantly higher than the low-period average of ~272, though slightly lower than the initial launch peak. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple delivery cycles (P1-P4, P7-P11, and P15-P18). Given the game date of July 15 (Summer), demand for denim trousers remains steady. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the period since the demand shift at P15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical evidence of 4 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a stable demand regime after a rebound that started around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 23 is approximately 394 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the demand behavior of this current regime (Periods 15-23), which balances the initial spike with the subsequent stabilization. This approach targets a service level of 0.80 (calculated from profit $4 and holding cost $1), while the backend's base-stock and cap logic will prevent excessive ordering given the current healthy on-hand inventory of 980 units and pipeline of 799 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P15-P24) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial seasonality, but remains higher than the mid-regime slump. Over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), the average demand is approximately 379 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since demand has been relatively stable with no clear trend up or down in the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24 avg: ~322), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current regime's central tendency while acknowledging the volatility. This balances the risk of over-ordering during a potential minor decline in July with the need to maintain stock for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which is a year-round staple. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for the same 10-period window to capture recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: average demand for P15-P24 is ~379 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a stabilized demand regime that began around Period 15. The recent average demand (P15-P25) is approximately 379 units, although the last two periods (P24-P25) have shown a slight dip (232 and 298 units respectively). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P21 order in P25. Current on-hand inventory is 570, with 1196 units in transit (orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25). To ensure we maintain the optimal base stock for a lead time of 4 (covering 5 periods of demand), I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the current regime from P15 to P25). This allows the OR backend to calculate the appropriate order based on the most relevant demand history while accounting for the established lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1032.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is in a stable demand regime that began around Period 15. The average demand from P15 to P26 is approximately 385 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 334 units, showing some volatility but no clear structural shift downward. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P21 and P22 orders arrived exactly at L=4 in P25 and P26). On-hand inventory is 492, and the pipeline is healthy at 1152 units, totaling 1644 units. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat (covering the P15-P26 regime) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~1925 units) while accounting for the current inventory position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1597.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending P27 was 493, which is significantly higher than the average of the stable regime observed between P15-P24 (~379). This reflects a potential seasonal uptick as we move into late August (back-to-school season for denim trousers). Over the last 3 periods (P25-P27), demand has averaged 390.6 (298, 381, 493). Given the current on-hand inventory of 375 and a lead time of 4, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the next 5 periods of demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P21, P22, and P23 at L=4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime since the last major shift (P15), which averages approximately 382 units per period, while allowing the OR backend to account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Recent 3-period demand (P25-P27) has increased to an average of ~391 from the previous 10-period average of ~379, likely reflecting early late-summer/autumn seasonality for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is entering late August (2019/8/26). Historically, denim demand in the 'Divided' collection often sees a seasonal uptick during the back-to-school transition and late summer/autumn period. Recent data confirms a demand regime shift starting around Period 26: the last 3 periods (P26-P28) show an average demand of 435 units, which is a significant increase from the previous 10-period average of ~379 (+15%). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of P28, where the P24 order arrived). I will use N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and ensure sufficient stock for the expected autumn demand. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the stable historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Average demand increased from ~379 to 435 (+15%) over the last 3 periods (P26-P28), likely reflecting seasonal back-to-school demand for denim.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the HW Skinny Denim TRS is showing a clear upward trend corresponding with late summer and the transition into autumn seasonality (Back-to-School period). Current demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has averaged approximately 426 units, significantly higher than the previous 10-period average of ~379. Given this is denim, a staple item, we anticipate demand to remain elevated or continue increasing throughout September. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods. With only 64 units on-hand and a pipeline that needs to cover the next 5 periods (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher seasonal average (~426 * 5 = 2130). Sigma_hat is also updated using the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand increased from ~379 to ~426 (+12%) over the last 4 periods (P26-P29), reflecting seasonal autumn demand for denim.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1292.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent 5-period demand (P26-P30) shows a significant seasonal increase, with an average of 488 units, peaking at 740 units in P30. This reflects the transition into the autumn denim season. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P30 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and stockouts, I need to adjust mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime to ensure the base stock level (target pipeline) is sufficient. I will use recent_N with N=5 to focus on this new higher-demand period and set sigma_hat to the same period to account for the increased volatility observed in P30.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand increased from ~379 to 488 (+29%) over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), driven by seasonal autumn demand for denim. Period 30 saw a significant single-period spike to 740 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1388.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn demand phase for denim (mid-September). Recent demand has jumped significantly: P30 (740) and P31 (708), following an upward trend starting around P26. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 554, but given the specific product (high-waisted denim) and the date (mid-September), these spikes represent a sustained seasonal shift rather than outliers. Currently, there is zero on-hand inventory due to stockouts in P30 and P31, and persistent lost sales. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand window, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture this higher mean (approx. 550) and setting sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the increased volatility (std dev approx 160). This will raise the base stock level to better handle the seasonal peak and the backlog of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Average weekly demand surged to ~724 (+66% from previous regime) over the last 2 periods, signaling the peak autumn denim season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in its peak autumn demand season. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has surged and stabilized at a significantly higher average of ~718 units (740, 708, 707), compared to the previous regime of ~400. While the promised lead time remains 4 periods, recent deliveries (ordered P24-P28) have consistently arrived in exactly 4 periods, confirming L=4. Currently, the system is stock-constrained with zero on-hand inventory, as demand is outstripping previous lower-volume orders. To maximize reward, we must align our base stock with the current seasonal peak (avg ~718). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this specific peak regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the reduced volatility within this high-demand cluster. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: Average demand has surged to ~718 units (+68% from P26-P29 avg) over the last 3 periods (P30-P32), representing the peak autumn denim season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in its peak autumn seasonal demand regime. Demand has surged following Period 30, with a massive spike to 1428 units in Period 33, while the prior three-period average (P30-P32) was approximately 718. The current date (Sept 30) suggests we are at or near the seasonal summit. On-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent extreme spike, I am using recent_N=4 for demand estimation (P30-P33) to capture the current high-velocity environment without over-reacting to a single extreme outlier (1428) which might be an isolated peak. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 entered a hyper-peak phase in Period 33, with demand reaching 1428. Average demand for the P30-P33 window is 895.7 units (+110% from the P26-P29 regime).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn demand season for high-waisted denim. Demand has shifted into a hyper-peak phase; although Period 34 demand (748) dropped from the Period 33 extreme (1428), the overall trend from Period 30 onwards remains exceptionally high compared to the previous regime. The current average demand for the P30-P34 window is approximately 866 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. We are currently facing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals (ordered in P30) were insufficient to meet the surging demand. To recover and maintain service levels during this seasonal high, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the 866 average and increase safety stock by using recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat, as volatility has increased significantly since Period 30. The OR backend will use these values to generate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak demand phase confirmed (P30-P34): Current demand average is ~866 units, a significant increase driven by autumn seasonality.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a hyper-peak seasonal demand phase. Over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), demand has surged to an average of 822 units, peaking at 1428. The most recent demand (P35) was 606, which is lower than the hyper-peak average but still significantly elevated compared to the pre-September regime (~400). On-hand inventory is currently low (125), and there have been multiple periods of stockouts (P30-P34). Pipeline inventory is very high (4193), with large orders from P32-P35 (787, 750, 1480, 1176) expected to arrive starting next period (P36). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are in the middle of October, which typically represents the tail end or peak of autumn denim sales, I will use a recent_N (N=6) to capture the seasonal surge for mu_hat while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (1428 peak vs 606 recent). This ensures the base stock level remains high enough to capture remaining seasonal demand without excessively over-ordering given the massive incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak demand phase (P30-P35) confirmed: Average demand surged to ~822 units (high of 1428) driven by autumn seasonality, compared to the previous ~400 average.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a hyper-peak phase driven by autumn seasonality, though it has slightly cooled from the extreme spike in Period 33 (1428 units). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 788 units, compared to the ~426 units seen just prior. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With only 331 units on-hand and a massive in-transit pipeline of 3769 units (mostly resulting from large orders in P34 and P35 aiming to catch the peak), we risk overstocking if demand begins to mean-revert as the autumn peak passes. However, to ensure coverage of the current elevated demand regime across the (L+1) window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this peak average (~788 * 5 = 3940). Given the high volatility observed (standard deviation is significant due to the 1428 spike), I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to provide a sufficient safety buffer while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak demand phase (P30-P36) stabilized: average demand is ~788 units, characterized by high volatility (range 581-1428).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in its autumn peak season (October). We observed a 'hyper-peak' phase starting around Period 30, which peaked at 1428 units (P33) and has since stabilized at a slightly lower but still volatile level. Specifically, the last four periods (P34-P37) show demands of 748, 606, 581, and 643, averaging approximately 645 units per period. This suggests the extreme surge has passed, but demand remains significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~400. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the P33 order in P37). Given the current on-hand inventory of 438 and a very high in-transit pipeline (3406 units), we must be cautious about over-ordering as we approach the end of the peak season. Since denim demand often begins to taper slightly as winter approaches (November/December), using a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat will capture the stabilized post-peak demand level (~645) while sigma_hat will reflect the ongoing seasonal volatility. L is set to calculated as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-peak stabilization (P34-P37): Average demand has settled to ~645 units, down from the P30-P33 peak average of ~896, but remaining 60% above the pre-autumn baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a post-peak stabilization phase following the autumn hyper-peak. Demand has leveled off from the spike of 1428 (P33) to a fairly consistent range of 581-663 over the last four periods (P35-P38), with a current 4-period average of 623 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 1255 and in-transit at 1926 (total pipeline of 3181), and expected demand over the (L+1=5) period horizon being approximately 3115 units (5 * 623), the current stock position is well-balanced. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this localized stabilization around ~623 units, as using a longer window would either include the hyper-peak (over-ordering) or the pre-peak low (under-ordering). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the hyper-peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-peak demand stabilization (P35-P38): Average demand has settled to ~623 units with lower volatility (range 581-663) compared to the P30-P34 peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a post-hyper-peak stabilization phase following the autumn surge. Period 39 demand was 485, continuing a downward trend from the 600-700 range observed in periods 34-38. The current on-hand inventory of 1946 units is very high relative to the recent demand of ~485-660, and an additional 755 units are in-transit (orders from P36 and P37). To avoid excessive holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 4 (P36-P39) to capture the cooling demand profile, which averages approximately 593 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=6 captures the high volatility of the peak season to ensure a safe buffer while demand settles.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-peak demand cooling confirmed (P36-P39): Average demand decreased to ~593 units from the P30-P34 peak average of ~866. On-hand inventory is currently significantly above demand requirements.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has transitioned out of its autumn hyper-peak (P30-P34 avg ~866) and has settled into a post-peak cooling phase (P35-P40 avg ~593). Significant overstocking occurred due to large orders placed during the hyper-peak (P34 order of 1480, P35 order of 1176), resulting in a current on-hand inventory of 1728 units, which is approximately 3 periods of recent demand. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the cooling demand trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering P35-P40) to reflect the current post-peak regime. This will allow the OR backend to naturally suppress new ordering while the excess inventory is depleted, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the stabilized demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-peak demand cooling (P36-P40) confirmed: Average demand stabilized at ~593 units (range 485-663), down from the autumn peak of ~866 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has clearly transitioned from its autumn hyper-peak (P30-P34, avg ~866) into a stable post-peak cooling phase (P36-P41). Over the last six periods, the demand average has settled to approximately 583 units (581, 643, 663, 485, 581, 547), with significantly lower volatility. With current on-hand inventory at 1568 units and 969 units in-transit, the pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the next several periods, especially as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 47). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this cooled demand regime and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the earlier massive spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-hyper-peak demand cooling (P36-P41) stabilized: Average demand for the last 6 periods is ~583 units, down ~33% from the autumn peak. Volatility has also decreased significantly compared to the P30-P34 window.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike of 3,100 units, which coincides with the week of Black Friday (Nov 25 - Dec 2). This is a clear seasonal anomaly for denim and high-waisted jeans. This spike depleted all 1,568 units of on-hand inventory. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern from P30-P37. Given we are now in the post-Black Friday week (Dec 2), demand is expected to revert from the 3,100 peak but likely remain higher than the pre-peak cooling average of ~583 as the holiday shopping season continues. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 (P36-P42) to capture the cooling phase and the recent spike, which averages ~1,000 units per period. This approach balances the extreme outlier with the preceding regime to prevent excessive over-ordering while ensuring we replenish the now-empty shelves for December demand.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 (Nov 25) saw demand reach 3,100 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'post-peak' average of ~583.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the post-Black Friday (P42) period. Demand in P42 surged to 3,100 units, exhausting all on-hand inventory. Period 43 demand was 674 units, which is a significant drop from the Black Friday peak but slightly higher than the pre-peak 'cooling' average of ~583. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 3,977 units in-transit. The most recent arrival (P43) confirmed the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the product (skinny denim), we expect demand to remain higher than the mid-year lows but lower than the autumn/Black Friday peaks as we approach the end of the year. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the post-autumn baseline (excluding the Black Friday outlier) while accounting for the high volatility seen in recent weeks. Sigma_hat will be set to explicit to account for the extreme variance introduced by the Black Friday event, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer without over-reacting to the 3,100 spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43) settled at 674 units, indicating a return to post-peak levels (~600) rather than a sustained hyper-spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim) has transitioned from the ultra-peak Black Friday event (P42: 3,100 units) back to a post-peak stabilization phase. Period 43 and 44 demand (674 and 680 units) suggests a current regime mean of approximately 677, which is slightly higher than the pre-Black Friday 'cooling' phase (avg ~583) due to late-season holiday sales. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 4,846 units, including the large Period 43 order (2,511 units) expected to arrive in Period 47. For Period 45, I will utilize a recent_N (N=2) window for mu_hat to capture the immediate post-spike demand level (~677 units) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand level without overreacting to the singular P42 extreme.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) has stabilized at an average of ~677 units, approximately 15% higher than the pre-spike cooling average (~583), indicating late-holiday seasonal sustained demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. We are in the immediate post-Black Friday and Christmas peak for denim. Historical demand shows a return to a sustained late-holiday level around 670 units (P43-P45 avg: 670.3), which is slightly higher than the pre-Black Friday 'post-peak' cooling average of ~583. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. In-transit inventory is very high (4312 units) due to the massive catch-up order placed in P43 (2511 units) to recover from the stockout caused by the Black Friday spike (3100 units). As on-hand inventory is currently 0, the backend needs to evaluate the total pipeline. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-Black Friday demand level (~670 units) while ignoring the extreme P42 outlier. This will prevent over-ordering while ensuring arriving stock covers the high volume remaining in the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) has stabilized at ~670 units, approximately 15% higher than the pre-spike cooling average, reflecting sustained late-December demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical demand analysis shows a post-Black Friday stabilization around 670 units (P43-P46). However, we must anticipate the post-holiday January 'slump' typical for retail denim. The 'hyper-peak' and 'post-peak' cooling periods previously observed (P30-P42) provide a reference for regime shifts. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current On-hand is low (27), but In-transit is very high (3810), largely due to the massive order in P43 (2511 units) expected to arrive in P47 and the P44 order (1299) expected in P48. These two arrivals alone total 3810 units, which is ~5.7 weeks of supply at the current 670 demand rate. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand naturally cools in January, I will set mu_hat using a 4-period average (P43-P46) of 621.5 units to capture the most recent stabilized level, while allowing the OR backend to naturally cap new orders due to the massive pipeline inventory.
