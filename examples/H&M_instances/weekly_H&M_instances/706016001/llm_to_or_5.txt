Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand across the last 5 samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows an average of 688.8 units per period. The product is a staple item (high-waisted skinny denim), and the date is February 11, 2019. Since we are starting with 0 inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the lead time (L) plus the current review period (1+L=3 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level while ignoring any potential long-term drift that doesn't exist in the provided window. L is set to 'default' (2 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a basic fashion item. Historical demand (694, 576, 685, 715, 774) plus Period 1 demand (671) shows a stable mean around 686. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (808 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluded in Period 4). Current inventory is 0, and we have a stockout in Period 1. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=5 (including historical and P1 data) to capture the stable recent regime. Sigma will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand, helping to recover from the initial stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Looking at the history, the actual lead time for the first order was 1 period (Ordered P1, arrived P2), which is faster than the promised 2 periods. Demand has been stable: historical [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] and recent observed [671, 673]. The mean of these 7 data points is approximately 684. Since the actual lead time observed was 1, I will set L to 'explicit' value 1 to reflect reality and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the promised L=2. I will use the last 5 samples (3 historical + 2 observed) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation as there's no evidence of a regime shift yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019/3/4), the system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand = 0) because the P2 order (804 units) has not yet arrived. Based on the promised lead time of L=2, the P2 order is expected to arrive during Period 4, and the P3 order (520 units) during Period 5. Historical lead time for P1 was 1, but the absence of an arrival in Period 3 confirms that lead time is at least 2 for subsequent orders. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~666 units, though Period 3 saw a dip to 539. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P3, P2, P1, and 2 pre-game samples) to capture the current demand mean (~674) while accounting for recent volatility. Setting L to 'default' (2) ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx. 2022 units). With a pipeline inventory of 1324 units, the OR backend should trigger an order to bridge the gap toward the target base stock, helping recover from the current stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (March 11, 2019), the product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (High-waisted jeans). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows relative stability with a slight upward trend, though the concluding demand values in the game history [671, 673, 539, 447] suggest a recent dip. Lead time performance: Period 1 order arrived in 1 period; Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (the promised lead time). Current on-hand is 357 with 1337 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). With L=2, mu_hat needs to cover 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to account for the most recent demand levels observed in the 'conclude' messages (averaging ~582 per period) and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against variability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (Trousers). Historical demands are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447, 468]. There is a noticeable demand shift starting Period 3 (Late Feb/Early March), where demand dropped from an average of ~680 to ~480. This may be seasonal as we move further into spring. Regarding lead times, we have seen actual lead times of 1, 2, and 1 periods (Promised L=2). The order from Period 3 (520 units) is currently missing/overdue (placed P3, promised arrival P5, currently P6 start). Total in-transit is 722 (Period 3: 520 + Period 5: 202). Given the recent demand drop, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~482). I will set L to 'calculate' to account for the variability in arrival times (averaging 1 and 2).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 3: average demand decreased from ~690 to ~480 (-30%) likely due to post-winter seasonality for this denim SKU.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim) has shown a demand shift starting around Period 3/4. Historical demands are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] for the initialization, and recent observed demands are [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502]. There is a clear drop from the ~680-700 range to a ~470-500 range, likely reflecting the transition from peak winter to spring. Lead times have been volatile: P1 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2 periods, P3 is missing (ordered P3, currently P7, should have arrived by P5/P6), and P4 arrived in 1 period. The 'In-transit' of 722 likely comprises the missing P3 order (520 units) and the P5 order (202 units). Since P3 is significantly overdue (2 periods past promised L=2), it might be lost or severely delayed. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the lower spring demand regime (avg ~489) and set L to 3 to account for the pipeline instability and the missing shipment, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to cover potential delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-winter demand (since Period 4) stabilized around 470-500 units, down from 650+. Shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is overdue by 2 periods, suggesting potential loss or supply chain disruption.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a high-waisted skinny denim SKU. Demand has shifted from a high-initial phase (~680) to a more stable 'post-winter' regime (~480). Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times have been 1, 2, 1, and 2 periods. However, the order from Period 3 (520 units) is now 3 periods overdue (it should have arrived by Period 5 if L=2). Since Period 6 and 7 saw no arrival from that specific order, it is likely lost. This explains why on-hand is currently 0 despite recent arrivals. Inventory/Backlog: We are currently stock-out (on-hand=0) with 1076 units in-transit (the 520 potentially lost units + 556 ordered last period). Methods: I will use L=2 (default) as the physical arrival process still oscillates between 1-2. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 4 (avg ~482). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture current volatility. By using the 'default' L (2) and recent demand, the OR engine will calculate a base stock covering 3 periods of demand, helping to recover from the stock-out caused by the missing Period 3 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is now 3 periods past promised lead time and 5 periods since order date; confirmed as a lost shipment. Demand remains stable in the 450-510 range for 4 consecutive periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The SKU is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. Historical demand shows a clear shift from the initial high-demand phase (~690 units) to a stabilized lower-demand phase (~500 units) starting around Period 4. The last 5 demands were [447, 468, 502, 511, 560], averaging 497.6. The shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 5 periods past the order date with no arrival. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) due to this loss and the lead time of the Period 7 order. The Period 7 order (556 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 9) as the average lead time is roughly 1.5 periods (observed: 1, 2, 1, 2). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (1.5). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the stabilized lower-demand regime (avg ~500) while ignoring the initial high-demand outliers. For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will help the OR engine place orders that cover the current demand regime while accounting for lead time variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are managing a high-waisted skinny denim SKU. Historical demand analysis shows a clear shift: Period 1-3 averaged ~627 units, while Period 4-9 averaged ~470 units, though the most recent demand (P9) dipped to 335. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1490 units in-transit. Crucially, the order from Period 3 (520 units) is now 7 periods old and confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights. Orders from P7 (556) and P8 (414) are within the lead time window (L=2). The lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (Avg ~1.5). Given the current stockout (On-hand: 0) and the recent lower demand observation (335), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime (avg ~475) while ignoring the pre-March highs. I will use an explicit L of 2 to ensure the OR engine covers the promised lead time plus the current period, especially given the stockout state and the risk of lost shipments.

Demand has shown a significant downward trend over the last three periods (560, 335, 269), likely indicating a shift from early spring demand to late spring for this skinny denim SKU. The shipment from Period 3 (520 units) is confirmed lost. The shipment from Period 7 arrived in Period 10 (LT=3). There are currently 994 units in transit (ordered in Periods 8 and 10). Because the current on-hand (287) plus the large pipeline (994) significantly exceeds expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 300 = 900), the backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero or near-zero order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent sharp decline and 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the observed variability (LTs of 1, 2, 1, 2, 3).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~500 to ~300 (-40%) as spring progresses. Lead time variability confirmed: Observed LT range [1, 3], with the most recent arrival (P7 order) taking 3 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we observe that demand has shifted from a mid-spring average of ~500 to a lower late-spring regime of ~288 over the last three periods (P9: 335, P10: 269, P11: 261). This align with the 'Divided Collection' denim product cycle as warmer weather approaches. The shipment from Period 3 is confirmed lost. Regarding lead times, recent arrivals (P7 order) show a drift to 3 periods, though the promised lead time is 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (26 units) following Period 11 sales. We have 994 units in-transit (P8: 414, P10: 60). We expect the P8 order (414 units) to arrive during Period 12 (LT=4) or Period 13 (LT=5) given recent volatility. To stabilize the inventory position against the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the current ~288 demand rate, and using 'calculate' for lead time to account for the observed increase in actual lead times (averaging 2.0+ across history) which will help the OR backend adjust the base stock level correctly for the L+1 period coverage requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: late-spring demand stabilized at ~288 units (-42% from previous regime), likely due to seasonal transition for heavy denim.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/6. We are in a lower demand regime for this skinny denim SKU as spring ends and summer approaches. Demand over the last 4 periods has averaged ~301 units (335, 269, 261, 339), confirming the shift from the ~500 unit regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 934 units in-transit. The 934 units in-transit includes a stale shipment from Period 8 (414 units) which is now 5 periods since ordering (3 periods past promised LT), and a more recent order from Period 7 (556 units) has already arrived, suggesting the P8 order is likely lost. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Since observed lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods, and there is a suspected lost shipment, I will use 'calculate' for L to use the historical average. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current ~300 unit regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: late-spring demand stabilized at ~301 units (Periods 9-12), down from ~500. Shipment from Period 8 (414 units) is now 3 periods past promised lead time; highly likely lost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/13. The SKU is high-waisted skinny denim. Demand has shifted from a winter peak (~690) to a spring baseline (~500) and now to a late-spring low (~297 avg for Periods 9-13). Period 13 demand was 241, confirming the sustained lower regime (N=5). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory (934) is misleading due to lost shipments. Specifically: Order P3 (520) and Order P8 (414) are long overdue (11 and 6 periods since ordering respectively) and are confirmed lost. Only the pipeline from P10-P13 is reliable (currently 0 units since P11-P13 orders were 0). Lead times have varied (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2). I set L=2 (promised) as it remains the central tendency. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~297/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will see 'In-transit' as 934, which is significantly higher than the calculated base stock for this regime, likely resulting in a 0 order. This is appropriate as the system must clear the phantom pipeline or await manual adjustment, but the parameters reflect the true current demand state.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime for late spring (May): demand stabilized at ~297 units (Periods 9-13). Cumulative lost inventory reached 934 units (Orders from P3 and P8).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waisted denim trouser. Historically, demand has declined significantly as the season transitions into late May (Regime 3, Periods 9-14), with an average demand of approximately 272 units, and the most recent observation hitting a low of 189 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 934 units is composed of orders from Period 3 (520 units) and Period 8 (414 units), both of which are confirmed as lost based on multiple periods of non-arrival well past the promised lead time. The actual lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2. To account for the recent downward demand trend and current stockout, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (Periods 9-14) to capture the late-spring demand regime (approx 272 units/period). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand at the current lower volume while ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late spring (May) continues to decline: average demand for Periods 9-14 is ~272 units, with P14 showing a seasonal low of 189 units. Pipeline inventory of 934 units remains confirmed as lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 16 (late May). The product is a heavyweight skinny denim trouser, which is experiencing a seasonal decline as spring moves into summer. Demand for the last 7 periods (P9-P15) has averaged 287 units, despite a slight spike to 375 in Period 15. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (934 units) consists of orders from P3 (520) and P8 (414), which are 13 and 8 periods old respectively; these are confirmed lost shipments and will never arrive to satisfy demand. Lead time: Observed arrivals show LTs of 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and 2. The average remains close to the promised 2. Strategy: We must place a new order to replenish stock, as the system currently thinks the 934 units in-transit will arrive. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of 'ghost' inventory prevents it from ordering. To force an order, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the (L+1) demand coverage (approx 3 periods * 287 = 861) PLUS the lost units (934) to offset the pipeline deduction, while using 'recent_N' for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected. Previous insights regarding lost shipments (P3, P8) and the demand regime shift to ~290 units remain valid.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/06/03), demand is showing a significant recovery trend (P15: 375, P16: 533) from the previous late-spring low (avg ~290). This likely marks the start of a summer demand regime for denim. The primary challenge is the pipeline inventory: the OR backend observes 1642 units in-transit, but 934 units (from P3 and P8) are confirmed lost shipments. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate current demand mean at ~450 units. For a lead time of L=2, the required coverage is (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 450 = 1350. To offset the 934 lost units, I set mu_hat to 1350 + 934 = 2284. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the seasonal transition. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (range 1-3 periods, avg ~1.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 15: demand is rebounding from the late-spring low (~297) to an average of ~454 units (P15-16), indicating the start of summer seasonality.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10th), we are seeing a clear rebound in demand for this denim SKU, likely corresponding to summer shopping patterns after the late-spring dip. The average demand for the last three periods (P15-P17) is approximately 453 units, compared to the May low of ~272 units. Consequently, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 2443 includes the confirmed lost shipments from Period 3 (520 units) and Period 8 (414 units), totaling 934 units that will never arrive. To account for this 934-unit gap that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Specifically, a standard base stock calculation for 3 periods (L=2) at a mean demand of 453 would be ~1359; however, to offset the 934 units of 'ghost' inventory, I am increasing mu_hat by that amount to 2293. This ensures the backend places a physical order rather than assuming the lost stock is coming. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical average lead time of ~2 periods (ignoring lost shipments). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand rebound confirmed: average demand increased from ~297 (May) to ~453 (June) (+52%). Total lost inventory remains 934 units (P3 and P8 orders).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The demand regime has transitioned from a late-spring low (approx. 300 units) to a summer rebound. Since Period 15, demand has been 375, 533, 451, and 462, averaging 455 units. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this higher summer demand level. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, historical lead times have varied from 1 to 3 periods (P16 order arrived in P18, L=2; P7 order arrived in P10, L=3). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average these observations. The sigma_hat will use recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this new regime. Note: The pipeline inventory (1735 units) contains 934 units from confirmed lost shipments (P3 and P8 orders). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher demand, I ensure the OR backend attempts to reach a sufficient base stock despite the inflated in-transit figure, as the cap logic will allow for necessary replenishment orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has entered a summer regime (P15-P19), averaging ~436 units per period, a significant rebound from the May low (~297). The OR backend sees a pipeline of 1735 units, but 934 of these (orders from P3 and P8) are confirmed lost shipments. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods) using the recent mean (~436) and add the lost 934 units to the total. This ensures the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation results in a target inventory level that ignores the lost units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer demand regime (P15-P19) averaging ~436 units (+47% vs May). Shipment from Period 17 (801 units) is now 1 period past the promised lead time (should have arrived in P19), suggesting a current actual lead time of 3 periods or a delay.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We are in a summer demand regime that began around Period 15. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 15-20) is 407 units. However, demand dropped to 265 in Period 20, which may be a weekly fluctuation or the start of a mid-summer dip. The most recent arrival (P17 order) took 3 periods (arrived P20), confirming the observation in Period 20 that lead times are currently 3 periods rather than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR engine covers enough periods of demand. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 15-20) to capture the current summer regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. Note: 934 units (P3 and P8 orders) are confirmed lost and remain in 'In-transit', so the pipeline inventory is effectively 611 units (P20 order).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P17 order arrived P20). Summer demand regime (P15-P20) averages 407 units, though P20 showed a significant drop to 265.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we are in a summer demand regime. Recent demand (P15-P21) shows high volatility: [375, 533, 451, 462, 358, 265, 353], averaging approximately 400 units. The previous period (P21) had a demand of 353. The actual lead time has stabilized between 1 and 3 periods, with the P20 order arriving in just 1 period (P21). However, to be safe against the variability seen in P17 (3 periods) and the fact that 934 units in the 'In-transit' figure are confirmed lost (from P3 and P8), I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will monitor for more delays. I'll use a recent window (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current summer regime (~400/period) and sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std ~86). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 794 units, but because the pipeline is 'cluttered' with lost units (934), the OR engine needs to know that the pipeline is effectively empty of valid units. Since I cannot manually zero the pipeline in the backend, I rely on the OR engine's logic where base_stock - pipeline_inventory determines the order. If the engine sees 934 in transit, it may not order; however, the carry-over insights inform my choice to keep mu_hat aligned with the recent mean to trigger appropriate replenishment if on-hand drops.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer demand regime (P15-P21) average is ~400 units with high volatility (range 265-533). Lead time remains variable between 1 and 3 periods. Total lost inventory of 934 units (P3 and P8) remains in the system 'In-transit' count.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 23 (July 15) shows on-hand inventory of 401 units. In-transit inventory remains at 934, which consists of the lost shipments from Period 3 (520 units) and Period 8 (414 units). Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Recent observed: 3, 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (approx 2 periods), which provides a stable buffer for the OR backend. Demand analysis shows a summer regime (P15-P22) with a mean of ~396 units. Although there's high volatility (range 265-533), the recent demands (353, 393) suggest relative stability around the 400-mark. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the full summer regime mean, and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the seasonal volatility. The OR backend will see (on-hand 401 + pipeline 934), but because 934 units are lost, it will significantly under-order if it counts them. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the actual demand and using an average L, I ensure the target base stock is high enough to eventually trigger replenishment once the 'In-transit' phantom inventory doesn't arrive.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 24 (July 22). Analysis of demand from Period 15 to 23 shows a stable summer regime with an average demand of approximately 400 units (mean: 399.8). The recent four periods (P20-P23) show demand of 265, 353, 393, and 369, maintaining this level. On-hand inventory is low (32 units) after satisfying demand in Period 23. The 'In-transit' count of 934 units is confirmed as lost shipments from Period 3 (520) and Period 8 (414) based on historical carry-over insights. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use mu_hat to offset these 'phantom' units to trigger a new order. For Period 24, I set L=2 (promised). To ensure the backend places an order to replenish the 32 units on-hand against a ~400 unit demand and 934 units of 'ghost' pipeline, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Base stock is roughly (L+1)*demand. (2+1)*400 = 1200. To order ~1200 units while the system thinks 934 are in transit, mu_hat needs to be around 2134. However, the backend cap limits orders to roughly mu_hat/(1+L) + safety stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus the lost units to force a replenishment.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25 (late July). The demand regime for the summer (P15-P24) is averaging 379 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1778 units, but 934 units (from P3 and P8 orders) are confirmed lost based on previous carry-over insights. Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (including lost units) from the base stock to determine the order quantity, I must adjust mu_hat upward by exactly 934 units to offset this phantom inventory. Without this adjustment, the backend will under-order, leading to stockouts. For the underlying demand forecast, I use the recent 10-period average (~379) and a lead time (L) of 2. Calculation: mu_hat = (1+L)*379 + 934 = (3*379) + 934 = 1137 + 934 = 2071. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N to capture the summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns detected. Phantom pipeline inventory remains 934 units (P3: 520, P8: 414), requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass the OR pipeline subtraction.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5th), the SKU is entering the late-summer phase. Recent demand (Periods 21-25) has cooled from the June peak, averaging 329 units compared to the ~400 units seen in June. We have zero on-hand inventory and a large 'In-transit' figure of 2202 units. This pipeline is composed of: 934 units of confirmed lost shipments (P3 and P8), 844 units from P24 (expected P26/P27), and 424 units from P25 (expected P27/P28). Since the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (including the 934 lost units) from the base stock, we must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target. If L=2, the backend calculates base_stock - 2202. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover future demand, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Forecasted demand for the next 3 periods is ~330/period. Calculation: (330 * 3) + 934 = 1924. I will set mu_hat to 1950 to ensure we maintain availability as on-hand is currently zero.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (late summer/August transition) averaging ~329 units. Total phantom pipeline (lost shipments) remains 934 units (P3: 520, P8: 414), which requires deliberate mu_hat inflation until these 'In-transit' units are manually cleared or balanced.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the SKU (High-waisted skinny denim) is in a late-summer demand regime. Recent demand (P24-P26) has averaged ~304 units, down from the June/July average of ~400 units. The 'In-transit' inventory is 2202 units, but this includes 934 units from confirmed lost shipments (P3 and P8). Additionally, recent orders from P24 (844 units) and P25 (424 units) have not yet arrived. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and observed variability (L range 1-3), the P24 order is expected to arrive during P27. The critical issue is the 'phantom' 934 units in the pipeline that the OR backend will subtract from its order calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these non-existent units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for (L+1) periods (3 periods * 304 avg demand = 912) and add the 934 lost units to 'trick' the backend into placing an order that covers real demand. I am setting L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat based on the recent 5 periods to account for volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns detected. Phantom pipeline inventory remains 934 units (P3: 520, P8: 414), continuing to necessitate mu_hat inflation for the OR engine to place orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 28 (Aug 19, 2019). The SKU is high-waisted skinny denim. Historically, we see demand fluctuations tied to seasons. Recent demand (P24-P27) has been [232, 298, 381, 493], indicating a significant late-summer/back-to-school upturn. The 'In-transit' count of 2202 is heavily inflated by 934 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in P3 (520) and P8 (414) which the OR engine still subtracts from the base stock. Additionally, orders from P24 (844) and P25 (424) are still in transit but within a plausible lead time range (observed 1-3 periods). To force the backend to place an order despite the 934-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds (Pipeline + Demand Forecast). I am using an explicit mu_hat to ensure we cover the current demand surge (~400/period) plus the 934 units being erroneously held in the backend's logic, effectively 'clearing' the blockage.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge detected: demand increased from 232 (P24) to 493 (P27), averaging ~350 units over the last 4 periods with a clear upward trend. Phantom pipeline remains 934 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is experiencing a significant back-to-school demand surge. Demand in P27 (493) and P28 (432) is well above the previous summer average (~330). The current 'In-transit' figure of 1893 is comprised of: 520 (P3, lost), 414 (P8, lost), 844 (P24, overdue), and 115 (P28, new). The 934 units from P3 and P8 are confirmed phantom inventory. The order from P24 (844 units) is now 2 periods past promised lead time (P24 + 2 = P26 arrival), suggesting either a severe delay or a third lost shipment. With on-hand inventory at 0 and demand trending towards 500 units/period, there is an urgent need to restock. To bypass the 934 units of phantom pipeline inventory and the potentially lost 844 units from P24 (total 1778 units), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 4 periods total) will be 500 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 2000 (demand) + 1778 (phantom offset) = 3778. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school surge confirmed: Demand increased from ~330 to ~460 avg (P27-P28). Potential third lost shipment: Order from P24 (844 units) is now 4 periods old (2 past promised LT). Total probable phantom inventory: 1778 units (P3, P8, P24).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 30 (Sept 2) marks the start of the Autumn season. Recent demand (P27-P29) has averaged ~440 units, indicating a post-summer/back-to-school surge. The inventory system shows 3,902 units in-transit, but 1,778 of these are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P3: 520, P8: 414, P24: 844). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (3,902) from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force an order. To cover demand for L+1 periods (estimated actual L=3, so 4 periods) while accounting for the 3,902 pipeline deduction, I calculate: Target Base Stock = (4 periods * 450 units) + (Z * sigma). With a 0.8 service level (4/5), Z is approx 0.84. Estimated Sigma is ~80. Target Base Stock \u2248 1800 + 130 = 1930. However, the pipeline is 3,902. To bypass the subtraction and ensure we stay stocked for upcoming high Autumn demand, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1450. (1+L)*1450 = 4350. 4350 - 3902 = 448 units ordered. This allows us to replenish on-hand inventory which is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: Third lost shipment confirmed: Order from P24 (844 units) is now 6 periods old (4 past promised LT). Total phantom pipeline inventory is 1,778 units (P3, P8, P24). Autumn demand regime starting Sept: current average ~440 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is early September (2019/9/9), corresponding to the back-to-school and autumn transition. Demand has spiked significantly, reaching 740 in Period 30. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is approximately 515 units, indicating a clear upward trend from the summer average (~400). In-transit inventory is listed as 3787 units, but 1778 of these are confirmed lost (P3, P8, P24). The remaining 2009 units (ordered P29) are within the promised lead time (L=2). To force the OR engine to order despite the phantom 1778 units in-transit, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base demand at 550 units/period for the autumn regime. Calculation: (1+L) * 550 = 3 * 550 = 1650. To bypass the phantom pipeline of 1778 units, I must inflate mu_hat significantly beyond the pipeline count. I will set mu_hat to 4000 to ensure the engine generates a replenishing order for the current demand spike while keeping L at the promised 2 periods to maintain a tight order cycle.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand in P30 reached 740 units, with a 4-period average (P27-P30) of ~515 (+28% vs summer). Total phantom (lost) pipeline inventory remains 1778 units (P3, P8, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is experiencing a significant autumn/back-to-school demand surge. Recent demands for Period 30 (740) and Period 31 (708) are more than double the summer average (~320). The 3-period average (P29-P31) is 614 units. We must account for the 1,778 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (Orders from P3, P8, and P24) which the OR engine incorrectly believes are still coming. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, we must inflate mu_hat to bypass this. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, we need 3 periods of coverage. Forecasted demand is ~700/period, so required inventory is ~2100. Adding the 1,778 phantom units, we set mu_hat (explicitly) to 3878. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - 2218 In-transit) results in a meaningful order or maintains sufficient safety stock levels given the current on-hand of 1301. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: P30-P31 demand averaged 724 units, a 120% increase over the summer baseline. Total phantom pipeline (lost shipments) remains 1,778 units (P3, P8, P24).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/back-to-school season (September). Recent demand (P30-P32) has stabilized at a significantly higher level, averaging 718 units per period (740, 708, 707), compared to the summer average of ~400. This is a clear demand regime shift. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' count of 2348 includes the P32 order (570) and a substantial 'phantom' pipeline of 1778 units from lost shipments (P3: 520, P8: 414, P24: 844). Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target and force orders. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the current 718 rate plus the 1778 phantom units, the target base stock must be around 3932 (718 * 3 + 1778). I will set mu_hat to 3932/3 = 1311 to achieve this. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the current high-demand volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P29, P31) have been 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime confirmed: demand has stabilized at ~718 units (P30-P32), a ~120% increase over the summer baseline. Total phantom pipeline (lost shipments) remains 1,778 units (P3, P8, P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4136.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 34 (Sep 30). Demand has surged significantly due to the autumn/back-to-school season. Period 33 demand spiked to 1,428 units, effectively doubling the previous stabilization point (~718). Lead time (L) remains variable (recent observations: 2, 1, 3 periods), but since the OR engine is capped, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance. 

Inventory Situation: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 2,348. However, 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 1,778 units are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P3, P8, and P24) but still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory. 

Parameter Strategy: To trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline (2,348 - 1,778 = 570 real units in transit), I must inflate mu_hat. Demand for P33 was 1,428. Over (L+1)=3 periods, we need ~4,200 units. To bypass the 1,778 phantom units, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired stock and the phantom units (approx 4,200 + 1,800 = 6,000). This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to generate a replenishment order. sigma_hat is set to 500 to account for the high volatility seen in P33.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: extreme spike to 1,428 units detected, likely representing the peak of the autumn season. Previous phantom pipeline of 1,778 units (P3, P8, P24) persists.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/winter season (October). Demand in P33 reached a significant spike of 1,428 units, and although P34 settled back to 748, the trend is strongly upward compared to the summer baseline of ~400. We are currently facing a critical stockout (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure (5,930) is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments: P3 (520), P8 (414), and P24 (844), totaling 1,778 units. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation; to force an order despite this phantom 1,778 units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the phantom inventory. I am using an explicit mu_hat calculated as follows: Expected demand for P35-P37 is ~900 units/period (given October seasonality and recent volatility). Total requirement = (3 periods * 900) + 1,778 phantom units = 4,478. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods). Sigma is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in the autumn surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand volatility increased significantly in late Sept/early Oct (Range: 707-1428). Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1,778 units (P3, P8, P24), requiring continued mu_hat inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the SKU is in a high-demand autumn regime. Recent demand (P30-P35) averages 821 units, with a peak of 1,428 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' quantity (5,930 units) from the base stock. However, 1,778 of these units (from P3, P8, and P24) are confirmed lost shipments. To ensure the backend places an order despite this phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the subtraction. With L=2, the backend calculates base stock as approximately (1+2)*forecast. To clear the 5,930 in-transit plus satisfy current demand of ~821 per period, I set mu_hat explicitly to 8,500. This compensates for the lost 1,778 units and the pending P32/P34 orders (570 + 3,582 = 4,152), ensuring we maintain stock for the seasonal peak. Sigma_hat is set to 600 to account for high recent volatility (707 to 1,428).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand regime (P30-P35) average is 821 units, showing high volatility (Range: 606-1,428). Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1,778 units (P3, P8, P24), necessitating continued mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October period (P37). Demand has stabilized in an 'Autumn' regime following the September peak. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is approximately 796 units, though volatility is high. The primary operational challenge remains the massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The In-transit count is 9,005 units, but our history confirms that at least 1,778 units (from P3, P8, and P24) are definitely lost. Additionally, the large orders placed in P34 (3,582 units) and P36 (3,075 units) have not arrived yet. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL In-transit units from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless we set mu_hat high enough to exceed the In-transit count. Given the current demand (avg ~800) and L=2, a normal mu_hat would be ~2,400. To force an order and maintain availability for the upcoming late-autumn/winter season, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 12,000 to bypass the 9,005 units in transit and target a net arrival of roughly 2,000-3,000 units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Autumn demand regime (P31-P36) averaging ~796 units with high volatility (606-1428). Phantom pipeline inventory (lost/severely delayed) is significantly hindering the OR backend's ability to order; mu_hat must remain heavily inflated to ensure stock availability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Late October, approaching peak Autumn/Winter demand. Recent demand (P34-P37) shows high volatility and a stabilized level around 600-750 units after the extreme spike in P33 (1428). Lead time remains variable, averaging around 2 periods, but with some instances of 3. Crucially, 'In-transit' inventory has ballooned to 12,377 units, while 'On-hand' is 0. Most of this pipeline is 'phantom' (lost or severely delayed shipments from P3, P8, P24, and potentially P32/P34). The OR backend subtracts this 12,377 from the base stock calculation, preventing any new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the current pipeline to force the OR engine to place an order. Given the demand average (~700) and the massive pipeline (12,377), I am setting mu_hat to 16,000 to ensure the engine covers the actual forecasted demand while clearing the 'phantom' hurdle. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current high volatility (606-1428 range).

Carry-over insight: Massive 'phantom' pipeline detected: In-transit inventory reached 12,377 units in P38, while actual demand averages ~700-800. This confirms multiple lost shipments (P3, P8, P24) and likely systemic delays or losses of larger P34/P36 orders, requiring heavy mu_hat inflation for the OR controller to function.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU has entered a stable autumn/winter demand regime following the September/October 'Back-to-School' and 'Autumn' spikes. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 648 units (range 581-748), significantly lower than the extreme peak of 1,428 units seen in P33. A major correction occurred in Period 38: 6,447 units arrived (from P36 and P37 orders), leaving 5,784 units on-hand. This on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 8-9 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' count is still 9,977, which includes a massive 'phantom pipeline' of confirmed lost shipments (P3: 520, P8: 414, P24: 844, and likely P34: 3,582). Total confirmed/likely lost units = 5,360. Because the OR backend subtracts this 9,977 from its target base stock, it will not place any new orders. Given the high on-hand stock, no new orders are currently needed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current 650-unit demand level, and L=2. No inflation is required this period as we are intentionally overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in a late-autumn regime (P34-P38) at ~648 units/period. Massive pipeline correction in P38 (6,447 arrived) resolved immediate stockouts, but 'In-transit' remains inflated by ~5,360 phantom units from lost shipments (P3, P8, P24, P34).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 40 (Nov 11, 2019). We have a high on-hand inventory of 5,299 units following massive arrivals in Period 38. The current demand regime (Periods 34-39) has stabilized at an average of approximately 621 units per period, showing a slight seasonal decline as we move further into late autumn. The 'In-transit' balance of 9,977 units is highly problematic; it contains 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P8, P24, P34 total ~5,360 units) and potentially delayed large orders from P38 (4,047 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (9,977) from the base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed the sum of on-hand (5,299) and in-transit (9,977) inventory (~15,276 units). Given the current high stock level and stable demand, no new order is needed this period, but mu_hat must be set to reflect the actual demand regime for future calculations. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak autumn stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late autumn (Nov) stabilized at ~620 units (P34-P39). Total phantom pipeline (lost/stale orders) is estimated at 5,360 units, but with 5,299 units on-hand, immediate stockout risk is low.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18. Demand for the late autumn regime (P34-P40) is stable at an average of 618 units. On-hand inventory is high (4,718 units) due to massive arrivals in P38. However, 'In-transit' remains severely inflated at 9,977 units. This 'In-transit' count includes significant phantom inventory from lost/stale shipments (P3: 520, P8: 414, P24: 844, and likely P34: 3582), totaling approximately 5,360 units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the base stock calculation. Furthermore, the order from P38 (4,047 units) is currently in-transit and likely to arrive soon. Given the high on-hand stock relative to current demand (~7.6 periods of cover), the priority is to avoid further excessive accumulation while ensuring the OR engine doesn't stop ordering permanently due to phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N (N=7) to capture the late-autumn average and sigma_hat to account for volatility. L is set to default as recent arrivals (P36, P37) showed 1-2 period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline inventory (lost/stale orders) is estimated at 5,360 units (Orders from P3, P8, P24, and P34). Demand regime for Nov/Late Autumn is stable at ~618 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6030.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the system has an on-hand inventory of 8,218 units, which is extremely high relative to the current late-autumn demand regime (averaging ~580 units/period over P38-P41). The large arrival in P41 (4,047 units ordered in P38) has resolved previous stockout risks but created a significant holding cost burden. The 'In-transit' figure of 5,930 units remains heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P3, P8, P24, and likely P34). Given the high on-hand balance and the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), the objective is to prevent any further ordering until inventory levels normalize. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the stable late-autumn demand (avg ~580), and 'default' for L and sigma_hat. This will result in a base stock significantly lower than the current (On-hand + Phantom In-transit) total, effectively suppressing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (Nov) is stable at ~580 units. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost/stale orders) is confirmed at approximately 5,360 units (P3, P8, P24, P34). On-hand inventory is now excessive (8,218 units), requiring no new orders for the near term.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7282.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), we saw a significant demand spike to 3,100 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales. This reduced our high on-hand inventory from 8,218 to 5,118 units. While demand is expected to remain elevated during the December holiday season, the current on-hand inventory (5,118) plus the 'true' pipeline is substantial. We must account for 'phantom' in-transit units (estimated at ~5,360 units from lost orders P3, P8, P24, P34) which total 5,930 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom stock and stopping all orders, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat based on a forecast of ~800 units/period (post-spike baseline) over (1+L) periods, then inflating it by the phantom amount (5,360) to neutralize the pipeline subtraction. This ensures that if the system needs to order to maintain the ~800 unit safety level, it can. However, with 5,118 units on hand and 3 periods of coverage needed, no immediate order will likely be triggered, which is appropriate given the current stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand reached 3,100 units (Black Friday). Expect elevated December demand (~800/week baseline). Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at ~5,360 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1748.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), following a major demand spike in Period 42 (Black Friday, 3100 units). Demand for Period 43 settled at 674 units. Historically, December demand for 'superstretch denim' remains elevated compared to the autumn baseline but lower than the Black Friday peak. The on-hand inventory is currently 4,444 units, which is ample to cover several periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 5,930 units consists almost entirely of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (lost orders from P3, P8, P24, and P34 totaling 5,360 units plus the 570 units from P32 which are now 12 periods overdue). Since on-hand inventory is high and the backend policy would subtract the phantom pipeline from any calculated base stock, I will continue to refrain from ordering by using a 'default' L and 'recent_N' for mu_hat. This allows the high on-hand stock to be utilized while avoiding further over-ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-Black Friday demand (P43) confirmed at 674 units. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost/stale orders) is confirmed at 5,930 units (P3, P8, P24, P32, P34). On-hand inventory (4,444) is sufficient for the remainder of the holiday season without new orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), the SKU 706016001 has 3,764 units on-hand. Following the Black Friday spike (3,100 units in P42), demand has stabilized around ~677 units (average of P43-P44). Given the 'In-transit' figure of 5,930 units consists almost entirely of phantom inventory from lost or stale shipments (confirmed P3, P8, P24, P32, P34), the OR backend is effectively paralyzed from ordering as it subtracts this pipeline from the base stock. However, with 3,764 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~700-800 per period, we have over 4 periods of supply. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47), the current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand without risking stockouts. Therefore, I will set parameters that reflect the current stable demand but result in no new orders, avoiding further holding costs on an already high inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Demand has returned to a baseline of ~677 units/period following the December peak. On-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), nearing the end of the simulation (Period 47). Current on-hand inventory is 3,107 units. Recent demand has stabilized post-Black Friday (P42: 3100) at an average of approximately 670 units (P43-P45: 674, 680, 657). Even with the most conservative demand estimate, the current stock of 3,107 units is more than sufficient to cover the final two periods of the game (46 and 47) without any additional orders. In-transit inventory remains significantly inflated at 5,930 units due to historical lost shipments (P3, P8, P24, P32, P34), but this does not impact our decision as we aim to minimize holding costs on our already ample stock. No new orders are needed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47, the final decision phase. Current on-hand inventory is 2,632 units. Historically, the post-holiday demand (late December/early January) for this denim SKU has shown a downward trend, with Period 46 demand at 475 units and a post-peak average of ~620 units. Given that the 'In-transit' count of 5,930 units is comprised entirely of phantom/lost inventory (from Periods 3, 8, 24, 32, and 34) and on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand without incurring further holding costs from new orders, the goal is to prevent the OR backend from placing an order. However, since this is the final period, the order decision made now would only arrive after the game ends. I will maintain the current parameters but, with such high on-hand stock and the game concluding, no replenishment is needed. Lead time is set to default (2). Demand (mu_hat) is set to a recent 5-period average (P42-P46) to reflect the post-peak stabilization, which the OR engine will compare against the high on-hand inventory, resulting in a zero order.
