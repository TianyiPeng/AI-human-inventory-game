Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is/are 'High-waisted skinny denim trousers' in the Divided collection (targeting a younger/trendier demographic). The date is Feb 11, 2019. Historically, the last 5 periods of demand were [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. Demand appears relatively stable with a slight upward trend. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period of the simulation, I will use all available historical data (N=5) to set the initial OR parameters. My goal is to establish a base stock levels that covers the review period plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods of demand) to ensure high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is High-waisted skinny denim trousers. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 808 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (Arrival Resolution). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 as demand (671) exceeded supply (0). Historical demand samples are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671], which are relatively stable. Given the lead time of 4 and the 1-period review cycle, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Since we just placed a large order in Period 1 and we have no confirmed lead-time deviations yet, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stable trend while accounting for the lost sales event in Period 1 as a data point.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. This product (High-waisted skinny denim) is a staple item. Initial stock started at 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 because the initial order hasn't arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively (based on L=4). Therefore, total pipeline inventory is 1612 units (808 + 804). The historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] and the recent realized demand [671, 673] show a very stable mean of approximately 684 per period. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, which is roughly 3420 units. With 1612 in transit and 0 on hand, we are significantly under-stocked for the lead-time window. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (the historical window) to stabilize the base stock target and ensure we continue ordering until the pipeline is full.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple item. We are currently in Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet, which is expected given the promised lead time of 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (ready for Period 6 decision). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. Game history demands are [671, 673, 539]. The average demand is approximately 665. Since on-hand is 0 and we have 'sold=0' due to no stock, we are currently experiencing lost sales. The pipeline (2387) covers roughly 3.6 periods of demand. I will use the default lead time (4) and recent_N for demand to capture the slight downward trend across the game history (N=3) to avoid over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient base stock to resume sales once stock arrives.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 3141 units in-transit). Following the lead-time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations so far are expected and do not yet indicate a delay or lost shipments. Demand in the first 5 historical periods was [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], but the most recent 4 periods during the game shows a slight downward trend [671, 673, 539, 447]. Given the recent decline, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overreacting to the older higher demand while still maintaining a safe base stock. L is set to default as we haven't reached the 4-period window to confirm actual lead time yet.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18, 2019). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a 'Divided Collection' high-waisted skinny jeans. This is a staple fashion item. Historically, we saw a demand peak in early periods (approx. 680 units/period) which has recently cooled to approx. 450 units/period. The promised lead time is 4. Period 5 concluded with the arrival of the Period 1 order (arrived=808), confirming the actual lead time L=4. We currently have 340 on-hand and a large pipeline of 2333 units (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since average demand has shifted from the initial historical samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] to recent observed demands [671, 673, 539, 447, 468], I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend and stabilize inventory levels, avoiding over-ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand decreased from ~680 to ~560 over the last 5 periods compared to historical data. Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Reviewing the demand history: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502]. There is a visible downward shift starting around Period 3/4. The last 4 periods average 489 units, compared to the initial historical average of ~680. This suggests a transition from late winter into spring where demand for this specific 'washed superstretch' style might be stabilizing at a lower level or suffering from post-holiday fatigue. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals. In-transit inventory is high (1858 units) relative to current demand, composed of orders from P3 (775), P4 (754), and P6 (329). These are expected to arrive in P7, P8, and P10 respectively. Given the stock on-hand (642) and the heavy pipeline, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, as the service level calculation (mu + z*sigma) needs to reflect the lower mean (~489) and lower volatility of the recent periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8 (2019/4/1). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. We have confirmed the lead time L=4 based on arrivals from P1, P2, and P3. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: the initial 5 pre-game samples averaged ~688, while the actual demand observed in P1-P7 has averaged 544.6, with the last 5 periods (P3-P7) averaging 493.4. This indicates a significant decline in demand since the start of the game, likely due to post-seasonality or market saturation for this specific style. Current on-hand is 906 with 1104 in transit (from P4, P6, P7). Total pipeline (2010 units) is high relative to the recent demand average (~493/period), suggesting a need to throttle orders. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime (last 5 periods actual) and the 'default' method for L as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Avg demand for periods P3-P7 is 493.4 units, down from early history of ~680 units (-27%).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. Historical demand sequence (post-initial 5): [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560]. Total history (including initial 5): [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560]. As noted in carry-over insights, there was a significant drop in demand starting around Period 3. For the last 5 periods (P4-P8), the mean demand is 497.6 units, compared to the earlier history of ~680. We should focus on this new regime. Regarding lead time, arrivals for P1 through P4 have all confirmed an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory status: We have 1100 on-hand and 876 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower demand regime (~498/period), and L is set to default (4) as it aligns with observed history. sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent stable period range.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a sustained downward shift in demand. The mean of the last 7 periods (P3-P9) is 480.2, significantly lower than the initial historical data (~680). The most recent period (P9) showed a further drop to 335, which might be a temporary fluctuation or a deeper seasonal decline. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on P1-P4 arrivals. There is a gap in arrivals in P9 (expected order from P5, but 0 were ordered in P5), and the pipeline inventory (1445) is currently healthy relative to the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current lower demand level while smoothing out the P9 dip, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order against the old, higher historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease sustained: Avg demand for P3-P9 is 480 units, compared to initial historical mean of ~680 (-29%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a significant and sustained downward demand shift. Historical demand before P3 averaged ~680 units, while the average for P3-P10 is ~455 units. The most recent demand (P9-P10) dropped even further to 269-335 units, potentially indicating a post-winter/spring seasonality drop for this specific denim product. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (re-confirmed by the arrival in P10 of the P6 order). I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the regime shift starting at Period 3 while still maintaining enough variance data to account for the volatility seen in P8. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=8. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent. Current inventory (On-hand: 825, In-transit: 1449) is quite high relative to recent demand, and the OR backend's capped policy will help prevent over-ordering while we wait for the pipeline to clear.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift further confirmed: average demand from P3 to P10 is 455 units, a 33% reduction from initial levels. Period 9 and 10 showed specifically low demand (~300 units), suggesting a potential secondary downward trend or seasonal low.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is exhibiting a clear and sustained downward demand trend. Over the first five periods (historical + P1-P2), demand averaged ~675 units. This dropped to an average of ~510 units in P3-P8, and has plummeted further to an average of ~288 units over the last three periods (P9-P11). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 585 units on-hand and 1616 units in the pipeline (ordered in P8, P9, P10, and P11), the total inventory position is 2201 units. Given the most recent demand average (approx. 290 units) and a 5-period window (L+1), the target stock should be around 1450-1500 units. Currently, the pipeline is heavily over-supplied for the new low-demand regime (~290/period). I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this drastic reduction in demand and lower the order quantity, allowing the OR backend to burn through the excess in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped a second time, from a mid-level of ~510 to a current average of 288 units over the last 3 periods (P9-P11), representing a >50% decline from initial levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has exhibited a clear downward trend across multiple regimes. Initial historical demand peaked at ~700, dropped to ~500 (P3-P8), and has recently stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, the average demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) is 301 units. Given it is early May (2019/5/6), this product (washed denim jeans) may be entering a lower seasonal demand phase as weather warms. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P8 order arrived P12). Current inventory status is high relative to this new demand: On-hand is 772 and In-transit is 1090 (Total pipeline = 1862). With an estimated lead time plus review period (L+1=5) and a demand of ~300, the base stock requirement is approximately 1500 units. Since current supply (1862) exceeds the expected 5-period demand and the holding cost is relatively high ($1) compared to profit ($4), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (last 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime stabilized: Avg demand P9-P12 is 301 units, confirming a sustained drop of >55% from initial historical levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) is exhibiting a sustained downward demand regime. Historical demand was ~680 units, which dropped to ~500, and has recently stabilized at an even lower level over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). Specifically, the mean demand from P9 to P13 is approximately 289 units (335, 269, 261, 339, 241). The date (mid-May) suggests a seasonal transition away from high-waisted skinny denim. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (mu_hat will be approx (1+4)*289 = 1445). Current inventory (On-hand: 1100 + In-transit: 521 = 1621 units) already slightly exceeds this projected base stock requirement, so the OR backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate given the current excess relative to the lower demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime stabilized (P9-P13): Avg 289 units/period, a ~57% decrease from original historical levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-488.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a sustained low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 9 to Period 14 is 272.3 units, significantly lower than the initial historical levels of ~680. Current on-hand inventory is 1244 units, which at the current run rate covers more than 4 periods of demand. Combined with 188 units in-transit (ordered P11, expected arrival P15 arrival resolution), the total pipeline of 1432 units far exceeds necessary stock levels for a lead time of 4. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%. Given the high inventory and falling demand, I am using a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment, which will result in zero new orders while excess stock is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime (P9-P14): Average demand is 272 units/period, a ~60% decrease from the initial historical mean of ~680.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 706016001 shows a sustained lower regime that stabilized around Period 9. Over the last 7 periods (P9-P15), the average demand is 287.0 units, which is a significant drop from the initial historical mean of ~680. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods based on game history. Given the current high on-hand inventory (1057 units) and the low demand rate (approx. 287 units/period), the current stock covers nearly 3.6 periods of demand. With the lead time L=4, the pipeline inventory only needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. My goal is to use the 'recent_N' method to accurately reflect this lower demand regime (N=7 to capture the stability since P9) while maintaining the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. This will prevent over-ordering which would lead to high holding costs, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1.

Carry-over insight: Low demand regime (P9-P15) confirmed: Average demand of 287 units/period is stable, representing a 58% decrease from the initial historical mean.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has shown significant volatility recently. After an extended period of low demand (P9-P14 avg ~272), the last two periods have seen a sharp increase (P15: 375, P16: 533), likely driven by seasonal factors as we enter June. The current demand (533) is approaching the initial historical average again. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P9 to P16) to capture the current upward trend while still factoring in the preceding low-demand regime, yielding an average that bridges the two levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P11 order arrived P15). Parameters are set to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to this recovery in demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery observed: Demand increased from a low-regime average of ~272 (P9-P14) to 533 in P16, indicating a potential seasonal rebound as summer begins.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is showing a demand recovery following a deep low-demand regime. Demand in Period 16 (533) and Period 17 (451) significantly exceeds the previous low-regime average of ~272. This is likely a seasonal rebound linked to early summer (June). The historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 73 units on-hand and 925 in-transit (reflecting recent order adjustments), we need to ensure the base stock levels remain high enough to cover this new, higher demand level (approx. 492 avg over the last two periods). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to quickly capture this rebound, while using N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this transition phase. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Averaging 492 units across P16-P17, up from the previous low-regime average of ~272 (+80%). This suggests a new seasonal regime for the summer months.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a demand recovery phase, likely linked to the summer season as indicated by the date (June 17) and recent demand surge. Current demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the April/May slump: P16 (533), P17 (451), and P18 (462), averaging 482 units over the last 3 periods. The 'recent_N' approach with N=3 for demand and volatility parameters is selected to quickly adapt to this recovery while ignoring the preceding low-demand regime. Regarding arrivals, an order was placed on P15 (38 units) with a lead time of 4, which was expected to arrive in P19 (current period). However, we have zero on-hand inventory and the P18 sold only 73 units out of 462 demanded, resulting in lost sales. To prevent further stockouts and ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time calculation remains 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistent across historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery stabilized: average demand for P16-P18 is 482 units/period, a significant increase from the previous regime's average of ~287 (+68%). Stockout occurred in P18 due to late discovery of demand surge and depletion of on-hand inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 begins with 0 units on-hand and 2171 units in-transit. The SKU is currently experiencing a stockout due to a shift in demand regime that moved from ~280 units/period (P9-P15) to ~451 units/period in the most recent periods (P16-P19 avg: 451). This recovery aligns with seasonal expectations for late June. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have already placed large orders (728 in P18, 556 in P19) and have a large pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period mean (N=4, P16-P19) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this higher demand level (~450/period) while the OR backend manages the existing pipeline and cap. Service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which the OR engine will use to decide if additional ordering is necessary beyond the heavy pipeline already in flight.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime confirmed: Average demand for P16-P19 is 451 units/period, a ~57% increase over the previous low regime (P9-P15 avg: 287). Stockouts occurred in P18 and P19 due to this rapid shift.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a recovery/summer seasonal regime. Demand significantly bounced back starting in Period 16, though Period 20 showed a dip to 265 units. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been [533, 451, 462, 358, 265], averaging 413.8 units/period. This is a clear step up from the spring low of ~287, but the gradual decline over the last three periods suggests the initial recovery spike may be stabilizing or cooling. Actual lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Inventory status is recovering from stockouts in P18 and P19; arriving units (395 in P20) have restored on-hand inventory to 130, while a substantial in-transit pipeline of 1996 units (from large orders placed P17-P20) is scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 for the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this most recent 'summer recovery' regime while acknowledging the volatility, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer recovery regime (P16-P20) is averaging 413.8 units/period, compared to the previous low regime (P9-P15) of 287 units (+44%). Demand shows high volatility during this transition (std dev ~105).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has transitioned from a spring low-demand period (P9-P15 avg: 287) into a summer regime (P16-P21 avg: 403.7). The latest demand (P21: 353) is lower than the initial summer peak but remains significantly higher than the spring floor. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 269 and a significant pipeline (1643 units) including a large order of 728 due next period (P22), the risk of stockout is low. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current summer regime while accounting for the recent high volatility (std dev ~105). This balances the need to maintain service levels during this rebound with the avoidance of over-ordering as the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Summer recovery regime (P16-P21) average demand shifted to ~404 units, up from spring low of ~287 (+40%). High volatility persists (std dev ~105) during this transition.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the 'Summer Recovery' regime. Since Period 16, demand has stabilized around a higher mean compared to the spring low. Analysis of P16-P22 (7 periods) shows an average demand of 402 units/period, compared to the P9-P15 average of 287 units. The last three periods (P20-P22) have been consistent (265, 353, 393), though trailing slightly below the P16-P18 peak. However, given the product (washed superstretch denim jeans), sustained volume is expected throughout summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 604, and there is a significant pipeline of 1203 units (orders from P19-P22). I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this summer regime (P16-P22) while accounting for the high volatility observed during the transition (standard deviation ~95). This will set a base stock that protects against stockouts while the backend manages the order cap based on the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P22) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~402 units/period, a ~40% increase over the prior spring low (P9-P15 avg: 287).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a stabilized summer demand regime. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 407 units per period (P16-P23), which is a significant recovery from the spring low of ~287. Recent demand (P20-P23) has slightly moderated to an average of 345 units, but the broader summer average (N=8) of ~407 provides a more robust estimate given the earlier stockouts and volatility (std dev ~105). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals (P15-P19 orders all arrived exactly at L=4). With on-hand inventory at 791 and total in-transit at 1017, the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current summer regime while filtering out the initial high-demand history and the extreme spring lows. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 400+ unit average and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P23) stabilized: average demand is 407 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 105 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a stabilized summer demand regime for this skinny denim trousers SKU. Looking at the history since the recovery started in Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 407 units per period. However, Period 24 saw a significant drop to 232 units, which may be a weekly fluctuation or an early sign of a downward trend; I will monitor this but continue to base parameters on the current regime length (N=9, Period 16-24). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. On-hand + In-transit (779 + 1134 = 1913) is currently high relative to expected demand over the lead time (avg 407 * 5 = 2035), but the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive over-ordering if the base stock calculation suggests it. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the summer regime's mean and volatility while incorporating the most recent data point.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has stabilized into a summer regime following a recovery from the spring lows. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is approximately 371 units, though more recent periods (P20-P25) show a lower average of around 318 units. The latest demand in P25 was 298. Given the product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' (a year-round staple but subject to seasonal fluctuations), the current 'summer recovery' trend noted in carry-over insights seems to be cooling slightly as we enter August (P26, Aug 5). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 620 units on-hand and 1159 units in-transit (covering orders from P22-P25), the pipeline inventory is quite healthy. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the current stabilized demand level (~330 units/period) while accounting for the recent slight softening, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Latest demand (P20-P25) suggests a stabilization or slight cooling of the summer regime, averaging ~318 units/period, down from the initial recovery peak of ~450.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is currently in a stabilized summer regime. From Period 20 to Period 26, demand has averaged 327.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 59 units. This is a noticeable cooling compared to the high-volatility rebound seen in June/July (P16-P19), where demand peaked above 500 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 527 units and 871 units in-transit (total pipeline of 1,398), the inventory position is strong relative to the current demand levels of ~327 units/period. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) to focus on this stabilized late-summer phase. This ensures we don't over-order based on the earlier peak or under-order based on the spring low, while maintaining a high service level given the favorable profit margin ($4 profit vs. $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime (P20-P26), averaging 327.3 units/period, down from the early-summer peak of ~450. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1568.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand show a slight surge (Period 27 demand was 493), which deviates from the previously observed 'late-summer cooling' trend (avg ~327). We are now in late August (2019-08-19). Considering the product is high-waisted skinny denim, we may be entering a 'Back to School' or early autumn transition where demand for jeans typically increases. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this recent uptick while acknowledging the high volatility (std dev remains significant). I will use a recent window (N=8, covering Period 20-27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the stabilization after the early summer peak but includes the most recent surge. This results in a mu_hat of (1+4) * mean(265, 353, 393, 369, 232, 298, 381, 493) = 5 * 348 = 1740. Pipeline inventory is healthy (858 in-transit + 404 on-hand), and the OR backend's service level logic (q ~ 0.8) will balance the risk of holding costs against stockout costs.

Carry-over insight: Potential early autumn/Back-to-School demand uptick observed: Period 27 demand (493) is ~50% higher than the previous 7-period average (327).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is entering a new demand regime likely associated with the 'Back-to-School' season (late August). Demand in Period 27 (493) and Period 28 (432) is significantly higher than the mid-summer average of ~327. The average for the last 3 periods (P26-P28) is ~435, up from the previous regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift quickly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since demand is trending upward and is becoming more volatile during seasonal shifts, I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to provide a buffer against potential spikes as we head further into the autumn/winter cycle.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand uptick confirmed (P27-P28): Avg demand increased to ~462 units/period, a ~40% increase from the late-summer baseline of 327.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a 'Back-to-School' regime starting around Period 27 (early/mid-August). The average demand for the most recent three periods (P27-P29) is 440.3, compared to the late-summer baseline of ~327. As of September 2nd (P30), we are likely at the peak or sustained high plateaus of this seasonal trend. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 77 units on-hand and 1448 in-transit (reflecting strong orders made in P27-P29 to meet this surge), the goal is to maintain a base stock that supports the current elevated demand level (approx 440-460 units/period). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this latest demand shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L as lead times have been extremely stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is a denim trouser item. We are currently in early September (2019/09/09), which marks the peak of the Back-to-School season. We observed a significant demand surge in Period 30 (740 units), which followed an upward trend starting in Period 27. This surge led to a stockout in Period 30 as on-hand inventory was exhausted. To respond to this high-demand regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering Periods 27-30). This timeframe captures the shift from the late-summer baseline (~327) to the current Back-to-School average (~515). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the consistent arrival pattern in the history. The parameters are designed to ensure the base stock covers (L+1=5) periods of this elevated demand to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the increased volatility (std dev has increased with the volume).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand peak confirmed: Demand surged to 740 units in Period 30. The average demand for the period P27-P30 is 515.25 units, a ~57% increase over the late-summer (P20-P26) average of 327.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School/Early Autumn peak. Inventory has been depleted to 0 (on-hand) for the last two periods (P30, P31) despite a delivery in P31, as demand surged to 740 and 708 units respectively. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) is 553.8 units, significantly higher than the late-summer baseline. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this heightened seasonal demand. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~154) during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With stockouts occurring, the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to recover service levels and fulfill the pipeline requirements (L+1 periods).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Early Autumn peak confirmed (P27-P31): Demand surged to an average of 554 units/period, a ~69% increase over the late-summer (P20-P26) average of 327. Sustained stockouts in P30 and P31 due to inventory depletion.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 33, currently facing a significant demand surge associated with the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn season. Demand has averaged approximately 609 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32: 432, 396, 740, 708, 707), a drastic increase from the late-summer baseline of ~327. We are currently stocked out (on-hand 0). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy that requires mu_hat (expected demand over review + lead time) and sigma_hat. Given the clear and sustained demand shift over the last 5 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P28 order arrived P32). Pipeline inventory is high (2586 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock. The recent stockouts in P30-P32 confirm the need for higher base stock targets to meet the 80% service level target (implied by Profit $4 / Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Early Autumn demand surge stabilized (P28-P32): Average demand has increased to 609 units/period, up from the late-summer average of 327 (+86%). Increased volatility observed during this peak (std dev ~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2428.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 34, we are in the midst of a significant Autumn/Back-to-School demand surge. Period 33 demand spiked dramatically to 1428 units, more than double the previous surge average. The 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (high-waisted jeans) is a seasonal staple for this time of year (September/October), explaining the explosive growth. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), average demand is 875.8 units with very high volatility. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with 2692 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, my parameters must account for the immediate high demand to recover inventory levels and prevent further lost sales during this peak. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime (P29-P33), which prioritizes the most recent surge data over the lower summer levels. I will use the calculated lead time which has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Autumn surge accelerated: Period 33 demand reached 1428 units. The average demand for the most recent 5-period window (P29-P33) has jumped to 875.8 units, a 167% increase over the late-summer baseline (327). High volatility is confirmed (std dev ~400 in this window).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2084.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn surge, potentially driven by seasonal factors. The most recent demand (P34) was 748, while P33 saw a massive outlier of 1428. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), the average demand is 866.2 units, which is a significant increase from the previous late-summer baseline of ~327. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand is 0) despite periodic arrivals, because the demand is outpacing previous order levels. To address this, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture this surge. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (400) to account for the extreme volatility observed (e.g., the jump to 1428 units in P33). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to raise the base-stock level to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand regime, while relying on the OR backend's cap to prevent over-ordering in case P33 was a one-time peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn surge (P30-P34) confirmed: average demand has risen to ~866 units/period with extreme volatility (one peak at 1428). This is a ~165% increase over the summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2259.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (superstretch denim) is currently in a high-demand autumn regime, likely driven by seasonal cooler weather. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 839.4 units, with a significant peak of 1428 in P33. While demand softened slightly to 606 in P35, the overall volatility remains high (std dev ~330). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The backend OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1) to reach the target service level. Given the recent stockout streak (P30-P34), I am using a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the higher mean and elevated volatility of the autumn surge (P30-P35 avg demand is 822.8), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent further stockouts during this peak season while accounting for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter regime confirmed: Average demand for P30-P35 is 822.8 units/period, a ~150% increase over the summer baseline (327). High volatility is sustained with a standard deviation of ~330 in this window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2053.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 823 units per period. Although the most recent two periods (P35, P36) have shown a slight dip (avg 593) compared to the extreme peak in P33 (1428), the overall trend remains significantly higher than the summer baseline of 327. We are currently observing high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 330) and have recently recovered from a string of stockouts. On-hand inventory is 271, and pipeline inventory is 3,829. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and current date (Late October), I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the last 7 periods (P30-P36) to capture this higher-demand seasonal state while smoothing out the extreme P33 outlier. This provides a mu_hat basis of ~823 and a sigma_hat basis of ~330 to ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) period horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2231.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late October/early November period (Period 38). Demand has significantly surged since Period 30, likely due to autumn/winter seasonality for denim trousers. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is 770.1 units/period, compared to the summer baseline of 327. During the peak of this surge (P33), demand reached 1428 units, though it has since moderated to an average of 610 units over the last 3 periods (P35-P37). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (recent std dev ~260) and the risk of stockouts seen in P30-P34, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the recent moderation. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to account for the heightened volatility of the autumn peak. This configuration ensures the base stock level remains high enough to cover the lead time plus review period (5 periods) at the current elevated demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime (P30-P37) average confirmed at 770 units/period, a ~135% increase over the summer baseline, with significant volatility (std dev ~260).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1552.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Winter regime. Period 38 demand was 663, and the average for the P30-P38 window is approximately 758 units per period. The peak seen in P33 (1428 units) remains an outlier but contributes to high volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 1100, and in-transit is 2601 (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38), totaling 3701 units. To avoid a repeat of the stockouts seen in P30-P34, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the regime since P30) to capture the current mean demand of ~758. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to account for the high volatility (std dev ~260) inherent in this peak season, ensuring a higher service level during the lead time plus review period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter high-demand regime (P30-P38) maintains an average of ~758 units/period, significantly higher than the summer baseline of 327. High volatility persists due to seasonal spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $250.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Winter high-demand regime for skinny denim jeans. While the peak volatility seen in Period 33 (1428 units) has subsided, demand remains elevated compared to summer levels. The last 10 periods (P30-P39) show an average demand of approximately 730 units with a standard deviation of 250 units. However, the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a slight cooling to an average of about 595 units. Given that we are entering the mid-November/Pre-Holiday period, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly increase due to seasonal shopping. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 1690 units on-hand and 2102 in-transit (total 3792), and a lead time of 4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat captures the broader seasonal level (~730/period), while N=10 for sigma_hat accounts for the high historical volatility to maintain safety stock. This ensures we don't stock out if another spike occurs before the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime (P30-P39) average refined to ~730 units/period. Recent data (P35-P39) shows a localized stabilization around 595 units, but volatility remains significant (std dev ~250 for P30-P39).

The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the Autumn/Winter regime for skinny denim (706016001). Historical average demand for this regime (P30-P40) is approximately 716 units per period. However, the last 6 periods (P35-P40) show a localized stabilization with a lower mean: (606+581+643+663+485+581)/6 = 593 units. Given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, which justifies a higher service level. Inventory is currently healthy with 1728 units on-hand and 1831 in-transit (P37-P40 orders). I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat (N=11, covering the start of the high-demand regime in Period 30) to capture the overall winter level while smoothing the extreme peak in P33. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=11) to account for the high volatility observed during this season. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime stabilization: Average demand for P35-P40 is 593 units, lower than the peak surge in P30-P34, but still significantly higher than summer levels (327). Volatility remains elevated compared to summer months.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter late November (Period 42), the demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers has transitioned from the volatile 'Autumn Surge' (P30-P34 avg 866) to a more stable 'Autumn/Winter' regime. Over the most recent six periods (P35-P40), the average demand is 593.8 units with a significantly lower standard deviation compared to the mid-autumn peak. The current on-hand inventory (1568) and in-transit units (1940) total 3508 units, which covers approximately 5.9 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a service level target of 80% (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized downward trend and prevent over-stocking as we move deeper into the season. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8352.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a massive demand surge of 3,100 units, likely corresponding to Cyber Monday (2019/12/2). This surge completely depleted our on-hand inventory. The current date is December 2nd, the start of the holiday shopping season. While the 3,100-unit peak is likely an outlier specifically for Cyber Week, we must expect elevated demand through December. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 1,420 units in-transit. The arrivals expected in Period 43 (ordered in P39: 576 units) and Period 44 (ordered in P40: 348 units) are relatively small compared to this new demand scale. To prevent further stockouts during the holiday peak, I am utilizing an 'explicit' mu_hat based on an expected average demand of 1,000 units per period (higher than the autumn average of ~600-750 but lower than the Cyber Week extreme) and increasing sigma_hat to 400 to account for high seasonal volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 3,100 units (Cyber Week). Transitioning to a high-demand holiday regime for December with expected average demand >1,000 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2304.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak holiday season (December). Period 42 saw a massive spike of 3,100 units (Cyber Week), leading to a stockout. Period 43 demand was 674 units, but this was constrained by early stockout (starting on-hand was only 576). The system is now recovering inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand observed in the transition to December and the extreme peak in Period 42, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1,200 units per period (6,000 for L+1). This reflects the expectation that post-Cyber Week December demand will remain significantly higher than the autumn average (approx. 600) but lower than the anomalous Cyber Week peak. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 400 (approx. 900 for L+1) to account for the extreme volatility observed recently. This parameter set aims to rebuild inventory aggressively to capture remaining holiday demand and prevent further lost sales during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) confirmed: Period 42 (Cyber Week) peaked at 3,100 units. Early December baseline (constrained) is >670 units. Expecting sustained high demand and volatility through the end of the year.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1392.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Demand is extremely high and volatile, as evidenced by the Period 42 spike (3,100 units) and recent unconstrained demand in P43-P44 (~674-680 units while stocked out). History shows lead time is stable at 4 periods. My objective is to maintain a high base stock to capture the remaining holiday sales through late December and early January. Since we have 4,017 units in transit (ordered in P41-P44) and 0 on-hand, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current holiday regime. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) including the spike is ~1,136. Excluding the P42 extreme outlier, the recent baseline is ~630. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*850 = 4250 to balance the high holiday potential with the risk of post-holiday drop-off. sigma_hat is set to 500 to account for high volatility seen in P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) confirmed: Mean demand including Cyber Week spike (P42) is ~1136 units (P40-P44). Excluding spike, active baseline is ~630-680 units, significantly higher than Autumn levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1984.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday season (late December). Starting inventory is 0 due to constrained sold units in Period 45 (demand was 657, sold only 496). Pipeline inventory is very high (4,175 units), consisting of large orders from Periods 43 (1658), 44 (1863), and 45 (654). The order from Period 42 was a zero-order, so the next expected arrival is the 1,658 units from P43, which should arrive in Period 47 (visible in P48). Period 46 will likely face a stockout before that arrival. Demand analysis: Cyber Week (P42) saw a massive spike (3,100), while the subsequent three periods (P43-P45) have averaged 670 units despite potential stockout constraints. Given the date (Dec 23), we expect high demand to continue through the end of the year and into the post-holiday sales period. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (last 3 periods) to capture the current active baseline of ~670 units, which is significantly higher than Autumn levels. Sigma_hat remains on recent_N=5 to account for the volatility seen throughout the December surge and the Cyber Week aftermath. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from the Christmas/Holiday peak (average ~1136 demand including Cyber Week) into the New Year, which typically sees a sharp decline in apparel demand. Period 46 saw demand drop to 475, confirming the holiday surge is over. We have 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts in P42-45, but a massive pipeline of 5425 units (P43: 1658, P44: 1863, P45: 654, P46: 1250). The order from P42 arrived as 0, which is correct as the decision was 0. The P43 order (1658 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P47) and will be visible in the next conclude message. Given the high probability of post-holiday demand collapse, I am using a recent window (P46) to set a much lower mu_hat to avoid extreme overstocking, especially as the current pipeline already covers over 11 periods of 475-unit demand. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 1-period sample (recent_N=1) and a very conservative L=4 calculation to reflect the new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse confirmed (Period 46 demand: 475). Demand has shifted down from December peak (~1136) to below-autumn levels (~600).
