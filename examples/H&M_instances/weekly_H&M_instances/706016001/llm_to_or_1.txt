Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a staple denim item (High-waisted skinny jeans). Historical demand shows an average of 688.8 units with a recent upward trend over the last three samples (685, 715, 774). Given that we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 2, the goal is to establish a robust base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the lead time plus current review period. Since there is no lead time history yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time = 2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (trousers). Historical demand over the last 6 periods is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671], which is relatively stable around a mean of 686. There is no specific seasonal event (Feb 18) for this product type currently. We started with 0 inventory, so Period 1 resulted in 671 lost sales. An order of 808 was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 2. Following the timing rules, this order should arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current pipeline inventory is 808. To ensure service levels, we need to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). I will use a recent_N approach for demand and sigma, setting N=5 as the samples are stable. I'll maintain the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (High-waisted skinny jeans). In the previous period (Period 2), we received the order from Period 1, indicating an actual lead time (L) of 1 period, which is shorter than the promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand for the last five periods (including pre-history) is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673], showing a stable mean around 684. Using L=1, the system needs to cover (L+1) = 2 periods of demand. Current inventory is 135 on-hand and 804 in-transit (due to arrive this period if L=1 holds). I will set L=1 based on the most recent observation and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend's capped policy will handle the order calculation based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period (Period 1 order arrived in Period 2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a fashion staple. Looking at the history, demand has been stable around 650-700 units (694, 576, 685, 715, 774 in history; 671, 673, 539 in game play). In Period 3, we experienced a stockout (demand 539 vs on-hand 135) because the Period 2 order (804 units) has not arrived yet. Although the Carry-over insight mentions a lead time of 1 period for the Period 1 order, the Period 2 order did NOT arrive in Period 3 (which would have been lead time 1). Since promised lead time is 2, the Period 2 order is expected to arrive in Period 4. The Period 3 order (520) is expected in Period 5. Total in-transit is 1324 (804 + 520). I will use the promised lead time L=2 for calculations. Demand mean (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=5 (including pre-game and game history) to capture the current trend (~680 units/period). Sigma_hat is calculated similarly. The goal is to recover from the stockout by ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted denim trouser. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], while game history demand (Periods 1-4) is [671, 673, 539, 447]. There is a visible decline in recent demand (mean of last 3 is ~552 vs earlier average ~680). The lead time is fluctuating: Period 1 arrived in 1 period, but Period 2 arrived in 2 periods (promised lead time). Period 3 (520 units) is still in transit and should arrive this period (P5) if LT=2. Total in-transit is 1337 (P3=520 + P4=817). On-hand is 357. To account for the recent demand dip and stabilization, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For Lead Time, I will stick to 'calculate' to average the observed 1 and 2 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand decreased from ~680 to ~550 over the last 3 periods. Lead time variability observed: P1 LT=1, P2 LT=2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (March 18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (Trousers). Historical demand shows a significant decline: P1-P2 averaged ~672, whereas P3-P5 averaged ~485. This represents a -28% shift, likely as the initial launch peak subsides or seasonal preferences transition. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P4:1). Note: The order from P3 (520 units) is still in-transit and overdue based on the observed 1-2 period lead time; I will monitor for a potential lost shipment next period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 706 units, which is quite high relative to the new demand regime (~485). For parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (1.33), which is more responsive than the promised 2. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (avg 485). 3) sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 3-5 average demand is 485 units, down from early-period average of 672 (-28%). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard high-waisted denim trouser. We are currently in late March (Period 7). The historical demand shows a clear downward shift: Periods 1-2 averaged 672 units, while Periods 3-6 averaged 489 units (a ~27% drop). The last 3 periods (P4-P6) show a stable mean of 472 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P1:1, P2:2, P4:1). The order from Period 3 (520 units) is missing after 4 periods (ordered P3, now P7), suggesting it is lost. The current on-hand inventory is 204. There are 520 units in-transit (the P3 order), but we should treat them as lost to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~472 and calculate for lead time to reflect the 1.33 average. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering the current lower demand while accounting for the historical lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 3 order (520 units) likely lost; no arrival after 4 periods (promised LT=2). Demand stabilized at ~472 units/period since Period 4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently out of stock with 0 units on-hand. Examining the arrival history: Period 1 arrived in 1 period, Period 2 in 2 periods, and Period 4 in 1 period. Critically, the order from Period 3 (520 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (placed P3, now starting P8 decision), confirming it is lost based on the 'Carry-over insights'. There is a pipeline of 774 units (254 from P7, 520 potentially lost but still counted in system pipeline). Demand has stabilized since Period 3; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 493.4. Given the stockout and the lost order, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the promised lead time (since actuals fluctuate between 1 and 2), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (approx 493/period). Setting L=2 and mu_hat based on N=5 ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand (~1480 units), which will trigger an order to replenish the current 0 on-hand status, accounting for the likely lost shipment in the pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Order from Period 3 (520 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Demand regime stable since Period 3 at ~493 units/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8th. The product is skinny denim trousers. Demand history shows two distinct phases: an initial high (P1-P2 avg ~672) followed by a stabilization at a lower level (P3-P8 avg ~504). The most recent demand was 560. I detect a stable demand regime from P3-P8 with a mean of 504.5. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1328 units, which includes orders from P7 (254) and P8 (554), plus older 'lost' units. The order from P3 (520) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order, promised L=2). Lead times have been volatile (1, 2, 1). I will set L to 2 (promised) as it is safer for replenishment. mu_hat will use the last 6 periods (P3-P8) to reflect the stabilized demand regime of ~504 units/period. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 1512 units). Given 1328 in-transit (of which some might be lost), the system will likely place a new order to bridge the gap and rebuild on-hand safety stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we face a critical stockout. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The product is High-waisted Skinny Denim, which generally has stable year-round demand but may see slight fluctuations in spring. Historical demand since Period 3 has stabilized around a mean of 480-500 units, though Period 9 showed a lower demand of 335. Analysis of lead times shows high volatility: P1 (LT=1), P2 (LT=2), P4 (LT=1), while the P3 order (520 units) is confirmed lost after 7 periods. We currently have 1056 units in transit (P7: 254, P8: 554, P9: 248). Given that the promised LT is 2, the P7 order (ordered 3 weeks ago) should have arrived by now; its absence suggests it might be delayed or lost. To protect against this uncertainty and current stockout, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays and using a recent_N of 6 for demand to capture the stabilized regime (Periods 4-9) which averages ~480 units. This configuration forces the OR backend to target a higher pipeline inventory to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 7 order (254 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered P7, now P10 start, promised LT=2), suggesting continued lead time instability or potential loss.

The product is a 'High-waisted jeans' SKU (706016001). We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). Since Period 6, demand has been on a downward trend, decreasing from around 500 to 269 in the latest period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead times are highly unstable: Period 7's order arrived after 3 periods (Period 10), while Period 3's order is confirmed lost. Orders from Period 8 (554 units), Period 9 (248 units), and Period 10 (436 units) are currently in-transit. The Period 8 order is now due (ordered P8, L=2 means it should arrive during P10 and be seen in P11 start, but the history shows it hasn't concluded yet). However, with 1758 units in-transit against a declining demand (avg ~388 over last 5 periods), the pipeline is heavily congested. I will set L to 3 to reflect recent actual lead time and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the declining demand mean (~388) and its associated volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering while accounting for the elongated arrival window.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend: Sustained decline from ~500 (Period 7) to 269 (Period 10). Lead time volatility: Actual LT for Period 7 was 3 periods; Period 8 order (554 units) is currently 1 period overdue.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a demand decline as we move further into spring, dropping from a peak mean of ~680 to a recent average of ~288 over the last 3 periods. In Period 11, the order from Period 9 (248 units) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, while the order from Period 8 (554 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P8, now P12 start, promised LT=2), suggesting it is likely lost. The order from Period 10 (436 units) is also due to arrive in Period 12 based on the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. I am using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower demand regime (~350 units/period) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect lower volatility. Lead time is set to 3 periods (explicit) to provide a safety buffer for the base stock calculation, accounting for the recent instability and potential lost shipment from Period 8, ensuring the pipeline inventory target is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 8 order (554 units) confirmed lost (4 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 average demand is 288 units, a significant decrease from the Period 1-7 average of ~530.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the start of the year. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 301 units. Product description (Jade HW Skinny Denim) suggests year-round relevance, but we are moving into May, which may see different seasonal behavior than early spring. Lead times have been volatile: P7 (LT=3), P8 (Lost), P9 (LT=2), P10 (LT=2). With the P8 order (554 units) confirmed lost, the pipeline inventory consists of P11 (196 units) and P12 (0 units ordered). Current on-hand is 97. Total inventory (97 on-hand + 196 in-transit = 293) is slightly below one period's average demand (301). Given the LT=2 promise and recent stability at that level for the last two arrivals, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) to capture the current lower demand regime and variance, ensuring the backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the lower regime (avg ~300) since Period 9. Lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods for the last two successful deliveries (P9, P10 orders).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'High-waisted jeans in washed superstretch denim', currently in mid-May. Demand has shifted into a lower regime starting around Period 9, stabilizing at an average of approximately 290 units per period (Periods 9-13: 335, 269, 261, 339, 241). Lead times for the most recent two deliveries (P10, P11 orders) have returned to the promised 2 periods. The order from Period 8 (554 units) is confirmed lost as it has not arrived after 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 52. The 'In-transit' figure of 1074 likely includes the lost Period 8 order (554) and perhaps the Period 3 lost order (520), which the OR backend might still count as pipeline. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units in the pipeline, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current demand regime (mean ~289), and use 'explicit' for L to ensure the backend projects for the promised lead time of 2 while ignoring the noise of earlier lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in Period 15. Analysis of the recent demand (Periods 9-14) shows a stabilized lower-demand regime with an average of approximately 272 units per period (335, 269, 261, 339, 241, 189). The demand in Period 14 was particularly low (189), suggesting a continued downward trend or stabilization at a lower level compared to the initial periods. Lead times have mostly stabilized at the promised 2 periods for recent successful deliveries (P9, P10, P11), though historical volatility and lost shipments (P3, P8) remain a concern. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 1074 units in-transit. These in-transit units likely represent orders placed in Periods 12, 13, and 14 (though the history shows 'ordered=0' for those periods, the 'In-transit' count suggests otherwise or that the OR backend is tracking cumulative pending units). To avoid overstocking while demand is declining, I will set L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~272 units since Period 9 (Periods 9-14: 335, 269, 261, 339, 241, 189). Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P9, P10, P11).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 16 (2019/5/27). Demand for this 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 9. The most recent demand (P15) was 375, which is higher than the previous five periods (avg ~260) but likely reflects residual demand from stockouts rather than a new upward trend. The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and 'in-transit' is 1074 units. Looking at the order history, the in-transit units are from Period 8 (554 units - now 8 periods old and confirmed lost) and Period 12-15 orders (none placed). However, the in-transit figure suggests the backend still counts the lost P8 order (554) and perhaps others. Since P12, P13, P14, and P15 had 0 orders placed, and the P11 order arrived in P13, the pipeline is actually empty of viable stock. Lead time has been 2 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P9, P10, P11). I will use L=2 (default), and set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P9-P15) to capture the current regime (mean ~287). This will trigger the OR backend to place an order to replenish the empty pipeline against the current demand mean.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we observe a significant upward shift in demand over the last two periods (375 and 533), suggesting a new seasonal or trend-driven regime compared to the previous low-demand period (avg ~270). The SKU (High-waisted skinny denim) is entering June, often a peak period for summer retail. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 1074 units in-transit (ordered in recent periods but not yet arrived). Historically, lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P9, P10, P11 all took 2 periods), though some earlier orders (P3, P8) were lost. Given the recent demand spike, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the trend (avg ~365) across the lead-time window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect higher volatility. Lead time L is set to default (promised 2) as recent successful deliveries align with this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: demand increased from ~270 to 454 (avg of P15-P16, +68%) potentially due to summer seasonality for denim trousers.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 18 (June 10). Demand for the last three periods (P15-P17: 375, 533, 451) has confirmed a significant regime shift, averaging 453 units compared to the previous low-demand period (P9-P14 avg ~272). This aligns with summer seasonality for denim trousers. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have 1349 units in-transit (this total reflects the cumulative 'ordered' amounts from history that haven't arrived, minus confirmed losses, plus the 275 ordered in P17). Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods for the most recent successful deliveries (P9-P11). To respond to the higher demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current spike and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new period. I will stick with the promised L=2 as the 'recent_N' average for lead time also supports this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~272 to ~453 (+66%) over the last 3 periods (P15-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 15, likely due to summer seasonality. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is 455.25 units (375, 533, 451, 462), compared to the previous low-demand regime of ~272. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 1475 units in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from P17 (275 units) and P18 (126 units), plus older potentially lost/delayed shipments (P3 order of 520 and P8 order of 554). Given the confirmed demand shift, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current 455 units/period average. Since lead time has recently stabilized at the promised 2 periods (P9-P11 arrivals), I will use the default lead time (2) and default sigma_hat based on recent volatility. The parameters seek to replenish stock quickly to meet the higher seasonal demand while acknowledging the large pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which typically sees summer seasonality. Demand shifted upward starting at Period 15 (mean demand P15-P19 is ~436 units, compared to ~272 previously). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 1475 units in-transit, but no arrivals have occurred since Period 13 (orders from P17 and P18 are still within lead time windows). The order from Period 3 (520 units) and Period 8 (554 units) were previously confirmed lost. Given the recent demand surge (P15-P19), I will use the last 5 periods to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Although lead time was historically 1-2 periods, recent gaps in arrivals (no arrivals in P14-P19) suggest potential delays or higher volatility; I will use 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to use the historical average, while mu_hat reflects the recent higher-demand regime (~436 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P15 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~272 to ~436 units (+60%) over the last 5 periods (P15-P19).

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is in a summer demand regime that started around Period 15 (May 20th). Since Period 15, the demand samples are [375, 533, 451, 462, 358, 265]. While the most recent period (P20) saw a drop to 265, the average of this 6-period regime is approximately 407 units. Given the product is 'superstretch denim trousers', high demand in summer (June/July) is consistent with seasonal trends. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P17 arrived in 3, P18 arrived in 2). I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the recent variance. I'll stick to the default lead time (2) as the backend already incorporates this into the base stock calculation, and recent arrivals confirm it's still close to promised.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 15-20) mean demand confirmed at ~407 units/period, significantly higher than the spring regime (~272). Recent lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers, currently in the summer season (July 8th). Demand since Period 15 has shifted to a higher regime (mean ~399 units), contrasting with the spring low of ~272. In Period 21, the stockout occurred because demand (353) exceeded available on-hand inventory (136). The on-hand is now 0. Pipeline inventory is 1224, primarily from large orders placed in the 'in-transit' total, though the history shows recent orders were smaller (P21 ordered 150). Lead times have been unstable, alternating between 2 and 3 periods (P17 arrived in 3, P18 in 2). I will set L to 3 to account for the risk of longer delivery times observed in this high-demand period. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand regime (P15-P21) while smoothing out the slight drop in demand seen in the last two periods (265, 353).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 15-21) mean demand confirmed at ~399 units/period. Lead time remains unstable, with recent observations of both 2 and 3 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15, peak summer season. Demand for denim trousers has stabilized in a 'summer regime' since Period 15, with a mean of approximately 399 units/period (confirmed in Carry-over Insights). The most recent 3 periods (P20-P22) show an average of 337 units, while the last 8 periods (P15-P22) average 398.75. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this summer regime mean for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (observed P17 LT=3, P18 LT=2). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this recent instability and to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. Crucially, the 'In-transit' count of 1748 includes 1074 units from lost shipments (P3: 520, P8: 554) which will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, I have inflated the mu_hat value: base_mu (399) * (1+L=4) + Lost Units (1074) = 2670. This adjustment forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock despite the high (but false) pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple item that has shown a significant demand shift since Period 15 (Summer regime). The average demand from Period 15 to 23 is approximately 399 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 2,401 units (primarily from massive orders in P22 and P23 totaling 1,327 units, plus older unaccounted in-transit). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods recently (e.g., P17 arrived in 3 periods, P21 arrived in 2 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the summer demand regime (P15-P23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average of observed lead times, accounting for the recent instability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in the late summer season for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 15, averaging ~379 units over the last 10 periods, though Period 24 saw a dip to 232. The 'In-transit' figure of 2401 units includes known lost shipments from Period 3 (520 units) and Period 8 (554 units). The active pipeline consists of the Period 22 order (524 units, now 1 period overdue) and the Period 23 order (803 units). Given the lead time instability (recent actuals of 2 and 3 periods, with P22 currently late), I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for potential delays. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 10 to capture the summer demand level (~379/period) while smoothing the recent P24 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use these to maintain a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for the active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Period 22 order (524 units) is 1 period overdue (ordered P22, promised L=2, current P25 start), confirming ongoing lead time instability (L often fluctuates between 2 and 3).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/08/05), we are in the late summer transition. Demand for denim trousers has softened recently, with Periods 24-25 averaging 265 units compared to the mid-summer average of ~400 units. A significant concern is the pipeline: the order from Period 22 (524 units) is now 2 periods overdue (4 periods elapsed vs promised 2), and the order from Period 23 (803 units) is 1 period overdue. This confirms a recurrence of the lead-time instability or shipment loss seen previously (Periods 3 and 8). I am setting L to 3 to account for this recent stretch in arrivals. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent cooling of demand (average ~310) while still weighting the summer peak to prevent stockouts if the trend reverses for back-to-school. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability re-confirmed at Period 26: Order from P22 (524 units) is 2 periods overdue, and P23 (803 units) is 1 period overdue. Demand has cooled from ~400 to ~265 in the last 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory includes 422 on-hand and 1598 in-transit. Analysis of the in-transit units (520 from P3, 554 from P8, and 524 from P22) confirms they are lost shipments, as they are significantly past the promised lead time of 2. The OR backend does not know these are lost and will subtract them from the base stock, causing under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting an explicit L=3 to account for the frequent actual lead time shifts observed (e.g., P23 arrived in 3 periods) and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters. Demand has cooled from the summer peak (~400) to a more moderate level (~300) over the last 3-5 periods (P24-P26 avg: 304). By setting L=3, I expand the pipeline coverage to (L+1)=4 periods, which helps offset the 'ghost' inventory from lost orders that the backend still counts as pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: P23 order arrived with LT=3. Lost shipment confirmed: P22 order (524 units) is now 3 periods overdue (5 periods since order) and likely lost. Demand cooled from the summer peak (~400) to ~304 units/period (P24-P26 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1688.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status (Period 28): On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 27. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 493 units, contrasting with the 'cooling' trend noted previously (avg ~304). This suggests late-summer demand volatility or a pre-fall peak for denim. Lead time remains unstable: the Period 23 order arrived with LT=3, and the Period 22 order is now confirmed lost (ordered P22, now P28 start, 6 periods elapsed). The pipeline inventory of 1598 units consists of orders from Periods 24-27 (if any were placed, though the logs show 0 units ordered in P24-P27). Wait\u2014checking the logs: orders were 0 for Periods 24, 25, 26, 27. However, 'In-transit' is reported as 1598 units. This implies the OR backend or previous logic placed large orders not explicitly detailed in the 'conclude' lines yet, or there's a discrepancy. Given the high demand (493) and the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent high demand (381, 493) while acknowledging the instability. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the frequent shifts between 2 and 3 periods observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility at end of summer: Period 27 demand spiked to 493 units (+62% vs Period 24-26 average). Lead time instability persists with frequent 3-period arrivals and a confirmed loss of the Period 22 shipment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) continues to experience strong late-summer demand. Recent demand (P26-P28) averaged 435 units, which is significantly higher than the early August cooling observed in the prior weeks. The lead time remains highly unstable: the P22 order is confirmed lost (now 6 periods since ordering), while recent successful deliveries (P21, P23) had lead times of 2 and 3 periods respectively. The current pipeline (1598 units) is entirely composed of theoretical orders that haven't arrived, but since on-hand is 0 and demand is spiking, I will set L to 3 to reflect the frequent delays. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (P25-P28) to capture the current high demand regime (avg ~401) and adjust sigma_hat to account for the high volatility in both demand and lead time delivery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: demand spiked and stabilized at a higher level (P27-P28 avg: 462 units) compared to the mid-August lull (~300 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), we are transitioning into early autumn. Historical demand for these high-waisted denim trousers shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 27 (mid-August), where demand increased and stabilized at a higher level (averaging ~440 units over P27-P29) compared to the mid-August lull (~300 units). The summer peak (P15-P23) averaged around 400 units, and current trends suggest sustained interest. Regarding logistics, the Period 22 order (524 units) is now 8 periods old and officially confirmed lost, as it is 6 periods past the promised lead time. Recent successful deliveries (P21, P23) show actual lead times of 2 and 3 periods respectively, indicating continued instability. I will set L to 'calculate' to account for this historical variance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~440). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility and ensure the safety stock covers potential spikes during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 27: demand stabilized at a higher level (P27-P29 average: 440 units) following the late-summer lull. Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has entered a significantly higher regime since Period 27 (averaging ~515 units/period over P27-P30), likely driven by back-to-school seasonality. The demand of 740 in Period 30 confirms a strong upward trend. Regarding lead times, the environment is highly unstable: the P22 order is confirmed lost, and recent successful arrivals (P21, P23) took 2 and 3 periods respectively. Orders from P29 (145 units) are still in-transit. Given the high demand and the risk of stockouts (current on-hand is 0), I am setting L to 3 to reflect the frequent delays. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the post-summer surge (P27-P30) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the 740 unit spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: average demand increased to ~515 units/period (+28% vs summer average), peaking at 740 units in P30. Lead time instability continues with a mix of 2-period and 3-period arrivals and confirmed loss of P22 order.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/09/16), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) is experiencing a significant late-summer/early-autumn demand surge. The average demand for the last five periods (P27-P31) is 553.8 units, compared to the summer average of ~400. Specifically, the last two periods saw demand spikes of 740 and 708 units. Lead time remains unstable; while the P29 order arrived in the promised 2 periods, recent history shows frequent drifts to 3 periods and a confirmed lost shipment (P22). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 2,178 units in transit (including recent large orders from P31). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high-demand regime of 554 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~160). I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 2.5 to bridge the gap between the promised 2 periods and the frequently observed 3 periods, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for potential delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 31: autumn surge observed with mean demand increasing to ~554 units/period (P27-P31) from a summer average of ~400 (+38%). Lead time remains inconsistent, alternating between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a significant autumn demand surge. Since Period 30, demand has consistently exceeded 700 units (740, 708, 707), which is a sharp increase from the summer average of ~400 and the late-summer recovery average of ~515. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this 'peak season' mean of 718 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect current high volatility. Regarding lead time, while Period 31 arrived in 1 period, the broader history shows frequent fluctuations between 2 and 3 periods, and the OR engine needs to protect against these delays during a high-demand phase. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 2.5 to buffer against the 3-period outcomes observed in P23 and P17, ensuring the base stock covers a longer horizon. The 'In-transit' of 1610 units likely accounts for the large order from P31 and smaller adjustments, but on-hand is currently 0 due to the demand spike, requiring aggressive parameter settings to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Mean demand increased to ~718 units/period (P30-P32) from the previous autumn average of ~515 (+39%), indicating a peak season for denim trousers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand skyrocketed to 1,428 units, confirming a massive peak season (likely autumn/back-to-school or late September surge for denim). The Period 31 order (580 units) arrived in Period 32 (LT=1), but the Period 32 order (12 units) has not yet arrived (LT is at least 2). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 2,360 units in-transit (including the large P33 order of 750). Given the explosive demand growth (P30-P33 average: 818 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to capture this peak, forecasting an average of 950 units per period over the next (L+1) window to avoid stockouts during this high-velocity regime. Sigma_hat is also increased via recent_N (N=4) to account for the high variance observed during this spike. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to balance the recent 1-period arrival with historical 2-3 period delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak confirmed at Period 33: demand reached 1,428 units, with the P31-P33 average hitting 947 units (+83% vs previous autumn average). Lead time remains volatile (recent observations: 1 and 2+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2990.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn season (October) for denim trousers. Demand has surged significantly: the average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 866 units, with a peak of 1,428 units in P33. This represents a massive increase from the summer average of ~400. The most recent demand (P34) was 748, suggesting the peak is sustained but volatile. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime (average ~866 per period). Lead time remains erratic, with recent successful arrivals taking 1 period (P31, P33 orders) but prior orders taking 2-3 periods or being lost (P22). Given the 'In-transit' of 2523 units (which includes the P34 order of 913), the pipeline is large, but we must maintain stock for the (L+1) horizon. I will use L=2 (promised) to ensure the OR backend covers enough demand, as relying on L=1 is risky given history. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the high volatility seen during this peak (standard deviation is high due to the 1,428 outlier).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak season confirmed: Period 30-34 average demand is 866 units/period, a >100% increase over the summer baseline. Demand remains highly volatile (range 707-1428). Lead time for recent successful deliveries (P31, P33 orders) has shortened to 1 period, despite a historical average of 2-3 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in an autumn peak demand phase. Demand has surged significantly starting from Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 845 units over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), compared to the summer average of ~400. While P34 and P35 showed a slight cooling (748 and 606 units), the overall volatility is high (range 606-1428). Lead time (L) has recently shown 1-period arrivals (P31 and P33 orders), though historical performance is unstable (2-3 periods). To protect against the high demand and potential stockouts during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the heightened volatility. L is set to 'explicit' at 2 to remain conservative, as the 1-period arrivals may be temporary. Current on-hand is 0, and pipeline is 3056, which covers several periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand regime confirmed: Period 30-35 average demand is 845 units/period (+111% vs summer baseline). Lead time for recent deliveries (P31, P33) was 1 period, but 2-3 periods remains the historical norm.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in an autumn peak demand regime. Historical demand since Period 30 has consistently been high, averaging 801 units (P30-P36). Although Period 36 showed a slight drop to 581, this remains significantly higher than summer levels. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have a large pipeline of 3056 units (orders from P32, P34, P35). Note that the P32 order (12 units) is extremely late, and P34 (913 units) is now 2 periods old, which fits the volatile lead time pattern (1-3 periods). To maintain stock during this peak and account for the recent lead time shortening (P31 and P33 arrived in 1 period), I am setting L to 2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, since P30) to capture the current high-demand regime mean (~801) and its high variance.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in an autumn high-demand regime, with demand averaging ~718 units over the last 8 periods (P30-P37). However, there is a significant inventory crisis: on-hand inventory is 0, and 3056 units are in-transit but have not arrived. Specifically, the orders from P34 (913 units), P35 (533 units), and potentially smaller residuals are missing despite a promised lead time of 2. Recent successful deliveries (P31, P33) had lead times of 1, but the current gap suggests a reversion to a 3+ period lead time or logistical delays. To address this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for these delays. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand level (~718/period) while accounting for the increased L. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to reflect the high volatility of the peak season. The OR backend will see a large pipeline inventory (3056), which will likely result in a 0 order this period to avoid overstocking once the bottleneck clears.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability returned at P36: Orders from P34 and P35 (1446 units total) are overdue, suggesting actual lead time has increased to 3+ periods again after a brief period of 1-period arrivals. Autumn demand regime remains strong, averaging ~718 units/period (P30-P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the autumn demand peak for skinny denim trousers (Nov 4th). Demand over the last 9 periods (P30-P38) has averaged 755 units, though volatility is high (ranging from 581 to 1428). Lead time remains highly unstable: while some orders arrived in 1 period (P31, P33), the most recent arrival (P35 order) took 3 periods, and the order from P34 (913 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P34, now P39, promised LT=2), implying a lead time of at least 5 periods or a lost shipment. Due to the high 'In-transit' balance (3007 units) relative to the 0 'On-hand' inventory, the OR backend's capped policy will likely restrict new orders. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the recent realized lead time and increasing mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the sustained high-demand autumn regime (~755 units/period). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand level while the backend manages the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed: Period 30-38 average demand is 755 units/period (+85% vs summer). Lead time instability persists: P34 order (913 units) is 2 periods overdue, while P35 took 3 periods to arrive.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a high-demand autumn regime for denim trousers, though demand has slightly cooled from the mid-October peak. The average demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 595.6 units. The most critical issue is the massive pipeline inventory (3,467 units), which includes a significant overdue shipment from Period 34 (913 units, now 6 periods since order) and more recent orders (P38, P39). While the P34 order might be lost, the OR backend already accounts for 'in-transit' units. Given the pipeline is nearly 6x the recent average demand and on-hand is 0, the backend will likely trigger the 'cap' or order 0. I will set L=3 based on recent instability (P35 arrived in 3 periods, P34 is overdue) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient window. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture the current demand level of ~600 units/period, down from the peak but still high. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the high variance observed during this peak season (range ~480-1400).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak: Period 35-39 average demand is 596 units/period, lower than the P31-P34 peak (~900) but higher than the summer baseline. Lead time remains highly unstable: P34 order (913 units) is 6 periods overdue and likely lost; P35 arrived with LT=3.

The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 591 units, a decrease from the peak average of ~900 but significantly higher than the summer baseline. Lead time remains the most critical source of uncertainty: the P34 order (913 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, while recent successful deliveries (P35) took 3 periods. Currently, 3,467 units are in-transit (orders from P38, P39, and potentially the very delayed P34). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and the next few weeks lead into late November, I am setting mu_hat based on the recent 5-period regime (N=5) to capture the current post-peak level. I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the observed lead time instability and the frequency of 3-period arrivals, ensuring the OR backend targets a stock level sufficient to cover the likely 3-period delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-autumn peak (P36-P40) stabilized at a mean of ~591 units/period. Lead time instability continues with P34 order (913 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods; actual lead time for successful deliveries currently fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safer planning horizon.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), we are in the post-autumn peak phase for the skinny denim trousers. Demand has stabilized at a lower, yet steady, level compared to the late-September peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 584 units/period, which aligns with the 'post-autumn peak' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and we are relying on the pipeline. Lead time remains unstable; while the P38 order arrived in P41 (LT=3), the P39 order (460 units) is now due (P39 + promised LT 2 = P41 arrival, visible P42 start). Since it hasn't arrived, we must assume LT=3 or greater. To protect against these fluctuations and the current stockout, I will set L to an explicit value of 3. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized demand regime of ~584 units while accounting for the moderate volatility (std dev ~65) observed in the recent data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). In Period 42, a massive demand spike of 3,100 units occurred, coinciding with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail window. This is a seasonal outlier significantly exceeding the post-autumn mean of ~591. Demand is expected to remain high but likely lower than the peak as we enter the December holiday season. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 2,523 units, including orders from Period 32 (12 units - likely lost), Period 34 (913 units - confirmed lost), Period 35 (potentially double-counted or lost), and more recent large replenishment attempts. Lead time has recently stabilized at 3 periods (P38 arrived P41, P39 arrived P42). I will set L to 3 to account for this stability. For mu_hat, I'll use an explicit forecast to capture the high-demand December period without being fully skewed by the single 3,100 outlier; I'll target a mean of 900 units per period (approx. 1.5x the post-autumn mean) across the L+1 window. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the extreme volatility seen in Period 42.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (3,100 units). Lead time stabilized at 3 periods for the last two deliveries (P38, P39).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (2019/12/9), immediately following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak (P42 demand was 3,100). Period 43 demand returned to a more normalized level of 674 units. Historical data suggests a post-peak stabilization. The most recent demand regime (P40-P43, excluding the P42 spike) averages approximately 644 units per period. Lead time has recently stabilized at 3 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P38, P39 orders arrived with LT=3; P41 and P42 conclusions confirm this). Consequently, I am setting L=3 to account for this consistent delay. For mu_hat, I'm using an explicit value based on the post-peak average demand (~644) scaled for the (L+1) horizon (4 periods), totaling 2576. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the expected demand while on-hand is currently 0 and pipeline inventory is high (4657 units) due to the large P43 order. This configuration helps prevent over-ordering while maintaining availability for the end-of-year period.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 40-43, excl. spike) stabilized at ~644 units/period. Lead time remains consistent at 3 periods for the last 3 deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1266.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the order from Period 43 (2134 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, bringing on-hand inventory to 1454 units. The 'Black Friday/Cyber Monday' spike of 3100 units in Period 42 has passed, and demand has returned to a stable post-peak level of approximately 677 units (average of P43-P44). Given that the current date is December 16th, we must prepare for the final few periods of the year. The in-transit inventory is 2523 units (though history shows no recent orders currently pending arrival after the P43 delivery, this number likely represents the 'ordered' values that haven't 'concluded' in the system's summary yet). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L=2 as a middle ground. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus on the stabilized post-peak demand (approx 677), and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility without the outlier spike from Period 42.

Carry-over insight: Post-BFCM demand stabilized at ~677 units/period (P43-P44). Lead time remains erratic, with the most recent delivery (P43 order) arriving in 1 period, contrasting with the previous 3-period trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1831.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the post-BFCM (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) period (Dec 23). Demand has stabilized after the massive spike in Period 42. Specifically, Periods 43, 44, and 45 show consistent demand of 674, 680, and 657 units respectively, averaging ~670 units per period. This suggests a stable pre-holiday/holiday demand regime for this skinny denim TRS SKU. Lead time remains erratic: while the P43 order arrived in 1 period, previous arrivals (P38, P39) took 3 periods. Given the holiday season logistics, I will use L=2 (promised) but account for the recent demand regime (last 3 periods) to set mu_hat. Sigma_hat is set based on the same stable regime to avoid over-ordering based on the BFCM outlier. On-hand (797) and in-transit (2523, mostly from a likely-lost large P34 order and more recent ones) are high, so the OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit new orders while we consume current stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-BFCM demand regime confirmed at Period 45: Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~670 units/period (Periods 43-45) following the Period 42 spike. Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, which is the post-holiday season (late December/early January). Demand for 'Skinny Denim TRS' typically stabilizes or cools down after the BFCM/Christmas peak. Current demand (P46) was 475 units, a significant drop from the ~670 average seen in P43-45, suggesting a seasonal transition. In-transit inventory is high (2523 units), primarily stemming from orders placed earlier to cover the holiday surge. With on-hand inventory at 322 units and substantial pipeline stock, no new order is required. Lead time remains erratic (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), so I will maintain 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation is robust against potential delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-spike stabilization while accounting for the most recent drop (P43-P46 average demand: 621 units). Sigma_hat will use the same N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime shift at Period 46: Demand dropped to 475 units, significantly lower than the P43-45 average of ~670. High pipeline inventory (2523 units) relative to current demand levels.
