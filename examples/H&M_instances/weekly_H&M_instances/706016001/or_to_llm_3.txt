Historical demand samples are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], yielding an empirical mean of 688.8 and a standard deviation of 72.8. The current date is 2019/2/11, which is just before the typical Spring season ramp-up for fashion, though the provided historical data already shows a stable, high demand level. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The OR recommendation is 808 units, calculated using a base-stock policy with a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), over-ordering is risky, but starting with 0 inventory requires a significant initial order to cover the (L+1) period cycle. The OR recommendation of 808 seems reasonable as it attempts to bridge the 3-period gap (P1, P2, P3) while respecting the cap to smooth the initial inventory surge. Since there is no lead-time history yet and the demand samples are relatively consistent, I will follow the OR recommendation for the first period to establish the pipeline.",

The Period 1 order (808 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (P1+2=3).

This is still below the needed coverage for Period 4. 5. Adjustment: I will follow the OR recommendation of 793.

Recent observed demands in Period 1 and 2 were 671 and 673 respectively. The demand is very stable around a mean of ~680. 3. Current Position: On-hand is 135.

With a lead time of 1-2 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 3 and potentially Period 4. Total requirements for 2 periods (L+1) at ~680/period is roughly 1360 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical mean is ~688. Recent demand (P1: 671, P2: 673, P3: 539) shows a slight dip in P3, but is generally stable for basic skinny denim. \n4.

Total pipeline is 1575. If the P2 order (793) arrives now, we have 793 to meet P4 demand (~650). If we order the OR's 533, our total commitment becomes 1575 + 533 = 2108.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] averaged 688. Recent demand [671, 673, 539, 447] shows a downward trend (avg 582).

Inventory Position: On-hand (346) + In-transit (1315) = 1661 units. Using the current average demand (~580), this covers nearly 3 periods of demand. 4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 412 units based on LT=2 and historical stats. However, with the current pipeline (1315 units) being very high relative to the recent demand drop, ordering more now risks high holding costs if the P3 and P4 orders arrive together. 5. Strategy: I will significantly reduce the order from the OR recommendation. The total pipeline (1661) already exceeds the required base stock for LT=2 (approx. 580 * 3 = 1740).

Given P3 is significantly past its expected arrival window (L=2) and P4/P5 followed it, I treat the 782 units as lost. Effective pipeline is 100. Effective position is 411 + 100 = 511. 3.

Based on observed lead times, the Period 6 order (741 units) is highly likely to arrive in Period 8 or 9. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P4-P7) has stabilized around 482 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial historical average (688) used by the OR. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 73 units. This is low because it counts the full 1119 in-transit against a base-stock level derived from the high initial variance. However, given the lost shipment in Period 3, we are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last two periods). 5.

Note: The P3 order (782 units) is confirmed lost as it is now P9 and subsequent orders (P4, P5, P6) have all arrived. Total effective pipeline is 528. 3. Demand Analysis: The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', a staple item. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 468, 502, 511, 560) shows a slight upward trend but remains below the initial historical average of 688. The 4-period average is ~510. 4.

In-transit inventory is 2060 units, which accounts for orders from Period 3 (782 units - presumed lost per Carry-Over Insight), Period 7 (378 units), Period 8 (150 units), and Period 9 (750 units). Lead Time Inference: Based on history, actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods. Orders from P7 and P8 are now within the arrival window (P7 was 3 periods ago, P8 was 2 periods ago). Demand Analysis: Product is 'High-waisted skinny jeans', a staple item. Demand has recently averaged around 450 units per period (P7: 511, P8: 560, P9: 335), which is lower than the initial 688 average. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely because it sees the high pipeline (2060 units). However, 782 of those units (P3) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline = 2060 - 782 = 1278 units. At a mean demand of ~450, we have about 2.8 periods of supply in transit. Given the current stockout (0 on hand) and the risk of further lost shipments or delays, I will order a small amount to maintain a continuous flow. The P7 order (378) should arrive this period, and P8 (150) shortly after. Total expected arrivals in the next 1-2 periods is 528 units, which barely covers one period of demand.

The in-transit pipeline (932 units) consists of the P3 order (782 units - confirmed lost) and the P8 order (150 units).

The current on-hand inventory (659) covers approximately 2 periods of this new demand regime. 4.

The last 4 periods (P10-P13) average 277.5 units, compared to the initial historical mean of ~680. This matches the 'Period 11' insight regarding a 50% decrease. Current Period 14 demand is likely to stay in the ~250-300 range.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 418. In-transit is 1168 (composed of P3: 782, P8: 150, P13: 236). Since P3 and P8 are considered lost, the effective pipeline is only 236 units (due in P14/P15). Total reliable supply = 418 (on-hand) + 236 (reliable in-transit) = 654 units.\n4.

The most recent demand (P14) was even lower at 189 units.\n3. Inventory Projection: Starting Period 15 with 229 units on-hand and an expected arrival of 236 units (from P13) provides a total of 465 units. Against a current demand expectation of ~250 units, we will likely end P15 with ~215 units. Adding the P14 arrival (180 units) in Period 16 brings the projected coverage to 395 units for that period.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 180 units is based on a 'capped' calculation that doesn't fully account for the lost shipments (inflating the pipeline) or the specific recent deceleration to <200 units. A base-stock level for 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 250 is 750 units. Current effective inventory (OH 229 + True Pipeline 416) is 645 units. Ordering 105 units would reach that 750 target.

{
  "rationale": "1. Lead-time Analysis: Actual lead time is fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, 1379 units are in transit. This total includes: P14 (180 units, ordered 3 periods ago), P16 (267 units, ordered 1 period ago), and potentially earlier lost orders (P3 and P8 are confirmed lost). The 180 units from P14 are overdue and expected to arrive in Period 17, while the 267 units from P16 are expected in Period 18 or 19.\n2. Demand Analysis: Demand has shown significant volatility. After a low period (avg ~250 units in P10-P14), the last two periods saw a sharp recovery (P15: 375, P16: 533). This likely signals a seasonal shift into June (early summer). Given the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' product description, this is a staple item prone to such fluctuations. I expect demand to stabilize around 450-500 units.\n3. Inventory Position: We are starting Period 17 with 0 units on-hand. With 180 units likely arriving this period and demand expected at ~450, we face a stockout risk if we don't account for the current deficit and lead-time buffer.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 356 units is based on historical averages that don't fully capture the recent demand surge or the pipeline uncertainty. To maintain a safety buffer across the 3-period lead-time window (L+1), we need approximately 1,350-1,500 units in the system (450 * 3 + safety stock). Current effective pipeline (excluding lost shipments) is roughly 180 + 267 = 447. Ordering 600 units brings our system total to ~1,047, which is a cautious increase to meet the rising demand trend without over-committing to high holding costs if the trend reverses.",

The orders from Period 8 (150 units), Period 14 (180 units), and Period 17 (600 units) are currently in-transit.

Recent demand has recovered significantly: P16 (533), P17 (451), and P18 (462), averaging 482 units over the last 3 periods. This recovery aligns with the seasonality of 'High-waisted skinny denim' as consumers update wardrobes for early summer. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is heavily skewed by the massive 'In-transit' figure (2212 units). However, much of this pipeline is likely phantom inventory (lost shipments from P3, P8, and potentially P14). If we treat P3 (782), P8 (150), and P14 (180) as lost, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 1100 units (P17, P18, and today's order).

Inventory analysis: Currently, on-hand inventory is 0.

Subtracting these from the 1,562 In-transit leaves an effective pipeline of only 450 units (Orders from P23: 150 and P24: 300). Current on-hand inventory is 388 units. Recent demand (P20-P24) has averaged 322 units per period. With a lead time of 2 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 25, 26, and 27 (3 periods * 322 = ~966 units).

Demand Analysis: Demand has trended upward over the last two periods (381, 493), moving away from the low-demand spring regime. The current 3-period average is approximately 390. Given the current date (Aug 19), we are in the late summer/back-to-school transition for 'High-waisted skinny denim', a category typically seeing stable to rising demand in late Q3. Lead Time: Actual lead time is volatile (1-3 periods), making it difficult to rely on 'just-in-time' arrivals. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it views the raw 1,932 in-transit units as sufficient to cover the base stock. By excluding the 1,112 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 820 units.

The adjusted 'Effective In-transit' is 2112 - 1412 = 700 units (which is the order from P32). Demand Analysis: Demand has surged significantly in the last three periods (P30: 740, P31: 708, P32: 707), likely due to back-to-school or early autumn seasonality for 'High-waisted jeans'. The current 3-period average is 718 units. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it mistakenly views the 2112 units in-transit as valid pipeline inventory. Strategy: We need to cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods). Total required = ~2154 units (718 * 3). Current inventory + Effective In-transit = 185 + 700 = 885 units. Deficit = 2154 - 885 = 1269 units.

This covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand (1,971 / 564). The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically sound because the pipeline (even when adjusted for losses) is sufficient for the next 3 periods.

This leaves an effective pipeline of 1,300 units (the P44 order). Demand Analysis: We are in the post-Black Friday December period. P43 and P44 demand has stabilized at ~680 units, which aligns with the September-October 'pre-peak' average.
