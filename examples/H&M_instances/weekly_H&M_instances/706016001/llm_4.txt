(a) World knowledge: The date is mid-February, which is a standard transition period in retail between winter and spring. Denim is typically a staple item with steady demand. (b) Demand analysis: Historical samples show [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], averaging approximately 689 units per period. This suggests a relatively high and steady demand for this SKU. (c) Lead time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, I must plan for current demand plus the coverage required for the lead time pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). (d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. (e) Order Logic: To cover 5 periods of demand (689 * 5 = 3445), I need to place a large initial order. I will order 3500 units to establish the pipeline and ensure I can meet demand once the shipment arrives around Period 5.",

The last three periods (P12-14) had demands of 339, 241, and 189, averaging 256 units.

This indicates a late spring/early summer recovery or 'back-to-school' style seasonality in high-waisted denim for the Divided collection.

  "rationale": "The product is a 'High-waisted skinny denim' (Garment Lower body). As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), it is entering the late autumn/early winter season. Historical demand shows a significant 'Back to School' peak in September (~866/period) followed by a stabilization in October (~610/period). In the most recent two periods (P39-P40), demand has averaged 533 units, confirming a softening trend as the season transitions towards winter. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory status: On-hand is 1491, and In-transit is 1300 (consisting of orders from P37: 200, P38: 500, P39: 200, P40: 400). Total pipeline visibility is (1491 + 1300) = 2791 units. Given the declining trend and the game's nearing end (Period 47), the pipeline should be managed to avoid excessive ending inventory, which incurs a $1.0 holding cost. Total demand for the lead time plus current period (P41-P45) is estimated at 500 units/period (500 * 5 = 2500). Current pipeline (2791) already covers this, so a minimal order is placed to hedge against any slight Thanksgiving/Cyber Monday spikes while prioritizing inventory reduction for the home stretch.",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'High-waisted skinny denim' (TRS), which typically sees stable demand but can be affected by major seasonal cycles. We are currently in late November (Period 42, Nov 25), heading into the holiday season. Recent history (P39-P41) shows a softening of demand to an average of 538 units per period, down from the October peak of ~610. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P42) will arrive for P46, just before the game ends in P47. Inventory assessment: On-hand is 1,144 units, and in-transit is 1,200 units (expected arrivals: 500 in P42, 200 in P43, 400 in P44, 100 in P45). Total pipeline is 2,344 units. At a demand of ~540/period, this covers roughly 4.3 periods, which is sufficient to reach the end of the simulation. Since we are entering the final periods of the game (47 periods total) and holding costs are $1/unit while profit is $4/unit, the risk of overstocking outweighs the benefit of further large orders. I will place a minimal order of 100 units to ensure service level remains high in the final weeks without ballooning holding costs.",

  "rationale": "The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) experienced a massive demand spike in Period 42 (Nov 25), reaching 3,100 units, which is consistent with Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for apparel. This surge completely depleted my inventory. Looking at the calendar, we are now in early December (Period 43, Dec 2). Historically, the post-Black Friday demand transitions into the Christmas holiday peak, though usually at a slightly lower volume than the extreme Black Friday spike. Recent non-event demand was averaging ~530 (P39-P41). I expect Period 43 demand to settle between the baseline and the recent peak, potentially around 700-1000 units. My pipeline currently consists of 800 units: 200 from P39 (due now, P43), 400 from P40 (due P44), 100 from P41 (due P45), and 100 from P42 (due P46). With 0 on-hand, the 200 units arriving now will likely lead to an immediate stockout in Period 43. I need to order aggressively to recover for the remaining 5 periods of the game, considering the 4-period lead time.

  "rationale": "The recent data shows a massive seasonal peak for Black Friday (Period 42) with demand reaching 3,100, causing a stockout. Period 43 demand was 674, indicating a post-Black Friday normalization. Given the product is high-waisted skinny denim, demand usually remains steady through December but declines sharply after the holiday shopping season ends (post-Christmas). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline contains 3,100 units (400 from P40, 100 from P41, 100 from P42, and 2,500 from P43). Based on the lead time of 4 periods: Period 44 (Now) will receive P40's order (400), Period 45 will receive P41's order (100), Period 46 will receive P42's order (100), and Period 47 will receive P43's order (2,500). My total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47) at a rate of ~600-650 units/period is roughly 2,400-2,600 units. Since 3,100 units are already arriving by the end of the game (P47), and most of that (2,500) arrives in the very last period, I risk significant holding costs if I order more. The 2,500 arriving in P47 will satisfy the final demand of the game but likely leave a large ending inventory. I will order 0 to avoid further inventory glut at the conclusion of the simulation.",

Currently, On-hand is 0, but there are 2,700 units in-transit.

Total pipeline (On-hand 0 + In-transit 2600) = 2600 units. Since we expect demand to potentially soften post-Christmas or maintain the current 650-700 baseline, 2600 units covers approximately 4 periods of demand at ~650 units/period (650 * 4 = 2600). Ordering now (P46) would arrive in P50. However, the 2500-unit arrival in P47 will likely create a significant inventory surplus that carries through P50, especially if January demand dips.

Since current on-hand is 0 but 2500 units are arriving this period, we will have 2500 available to meet the Period 47 demand. Given the demand trend, 2500 is more than sufficient to cover the likely demand (forecasted at 450-550 units).
