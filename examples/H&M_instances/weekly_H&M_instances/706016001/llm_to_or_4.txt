Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU 706016001 is a pair of high-waisted skinny denim trousers. There is no on-hand inventory or in-transit pipeline. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], which averages 688.8 units per period without a clear trend or significant seasonal shift immediately apparent from the early February dates provided. Given profit is $4.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (q) is roughly 0.8. Since this is the initial period with no delivery history yet, I will use 'default' for L to rely on the promised lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent baseline demand of 688.8 per period. For volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to match the sample window. The backend will then calculate (1+L) * mean and sqrt(1+L) * std for the base stock calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (trousers/jeans). Initial demand data (past 5 periods + Period 1) shows: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671]. The mean demand is approximately 686. Promised lead time (L) is 4. In Period 1, an order of 808 units was placed, which is currently in-transit. Because L=4, this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 arrival resolution phase (visible in Period 6's decision phase). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived, and the starting on-hand was 0. The demand in Period 1 was 671, which was lost as stockout. Since we have just one period of active history and demand appears stable around the 680-700 range, I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' for mu_hat. Given the target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The backend's base stock calculation is (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) to capture the most recent average demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple item. Current demand is stable with samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673], yielding a mean of approximately 684. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (808 units) and P2 (793 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively (P1 + 4 = P5). Since we started with 0 inventory and lead time is significant, we are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0), which is expected until the first order arrives. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent levels to determine the base stock, keeping L at 'default' as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (High-waisted skinny denim) shows a stable demand pattern with an average of roughly 685 units over the last 8 periods (including pre-game history: 694, 576, 685, 715, 774 and in-game: 671, 673, 539). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Because we are only in Period 4, no orders placed since Period 1 have arrived yet; the first arrival (from the Order placed in P1) is expected during Period 5 and will be visible in the P5 conclude message at the start of P6. Consequently, on-hand inventory is currently 0 and sales have not been realized. I will use the default method for Lead Time (4) and sigma_hat. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the full recent history (3 in-game + 5 pre-game) to smooth out the slight dip observed in Period 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and all units ordered thus far (808+793+775+790 = 3166) are correctly accounted for in 'In-transit'. Demand has shown a downward trend from roughly 670 to 447 over the last 4 periods, while additional history suggests a mean around 600-700. Given we have 0 on-hand inventory and the first batch arrives this period (after our decision), we need to maintain a standard ordering posture. I will use 'default' for L as no arrivals have concluded to suggest a drift. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (using the 5 provided past demands plus the 4 in-game demands) to capture the recent softening in demand while staying protected against a rebound.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a item with relatively stable demand, though we observe a downward trend from the initial seed data (~690) to the last 3 observed periods (~485). The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since L=4, my decision in Period 6 covers demand from Period 6 through Period 10 (L+1=5 periods). Current on-hand is 340, with 2538 in transit. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is 484.6. Given the slight cooling of demand compared to the very early weeks, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this shift while maintaining a base stock levels sufficient for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand shifted from ~680 to ~485 (-28%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple denim item. Observed demands are [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502]. A clear demand shift occurred after Period 2, dropping from a mean of ~672 to ~489. This lower regime has been sustained for 4 periods (Periods 3-6). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Current on-hand is 631 units, with 1745 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P5). Since the current demand is significantly lower than the initial periods, and we have a large pipeline relative to the new demand mean, the OR backend needs to recognize the lower demand regime and stable lead time to avoid over-ordering. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand cluster (~489/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~489 units/period starting Period 3 (4-period cluster). Lead time consistent at 4 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/04/01), we are managing 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. Demand has shifted from an initial high phase (~670) to a lower, stable regime starting Period 3. Demands for the last five periods are [539, 447, 468, 502, 511], which averages 493.4. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7), meaning we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (895) + Pipeline (1115) = 2010 units. With an expected demand of ~493/period, 5 periods of demand is ~2465 units. Current stock levels are slightly below the target base stock, but the backend's capped policy will manage the order size. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time since historical data consistently shows 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9 (April 8). Historically, demand for this skinny denim SKU dropped from an average of ~680 to ~485 around P3. Over the last 6 periods (P3-P8), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 504.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P8) was 560, showing a slight uptick as we move deeper into spring, which is consistent with seasonal clothing patterns. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Inventory level is currently healthy: on-hand is 1125 and in-transit is 851. Given the demand stabilization, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime since the P3 shift. This avoids the high-demand noise from P1-P2 while smoothing out recent weekly volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $370.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waisted denim trouser (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) in Period 10 (mid-April). Demand history shows a shift from ~680 to a lower level starting from Period 3. Recent demand (last 7 periods: 539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560, 335) yields an average of ~480. Period 9 saw a significant drop to 335, which may be a fluctuation or a new downward trend. Given the high on-hand inventory (970 units) and in-transit pipeline (1246 units), we have sufficient coverage. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand regime while including the recent volatility. The lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods across five consecutive arrivals (P1-P5 orders), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~480 units/period (avg P3-P9). Lead time stable at 4 periods (P1-P5 orders matching promised LT).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in Period 11 (Late April). Analysis of historical demand shows a clear downward trend: Period 1-5 averaged ~560, Period 6-9 averaged ~477, and the most recent two periods (P9 and P10) show a sharp drop to 335 and 269 respectively. This likely reflects a seasonal shift away from heavy denim as spring progresses into warmer weather. Although lead time is stable at 4 periods, total inventory (On-hand: 701, Pipeline: 1573) is very high (total 2274 units) compared to current demand. At a 300-400 unit per period burn rate, we have roughly 6 periods of stock, which is more than the (L+1)=5 required. My choice of recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent slowdown, while L=4 remains the observed standard. High on-hand inventory should trigger the OR backend to restrict further orders via the base-stock minus pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand slowdown confirmed: Avg demand dropped from ~480 to ~300 over the last 2-3 periods (P9-P10), likely due to seasonal transition in April.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in Period 12 (late April). Historical data indicates a significant demand drop starting around Period 9. The average demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) is approximately 288 units/period (335, 269, 261), down from the previous regime of ~480. This aligns with a seasonal transition away from superstretch heavy denim as spring progresses. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P9 and P11). Note: The order from Period 6 was 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 10 (P10 conclude). The pipeline inventory is currently high (1428 units), while on-hand is 585. To avoid overstocking during this lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average (N=3) to reflect the new mean of ~288. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture the reduced volatility of this stable lower-demand cluster.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand (P9-P11) stabilized at ~288 units/period, a ~40% decrease from the March average (~480).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard fashion item. Looking at the demand history, there was a clear regime shift starting around Period 9 (early April), where demand dropped from an average of ~480 units to ~300 units. The last three periods (P10, P11, P12) show demands of 269, 261, and 339, averaging 289.7. This matches the carry-over insight that April/May demand is stabilized at this lower level (~288-290). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals through P12. Currently, we have 772 units on-hand and 902 in-transit (orders from P9 and P10, as P11/P12 had zero orders). Since (1+L) = 5 periods, and our expected demand per period is ~290, the total inventory requirement (base stock) is roughly 1450-1500 units. Our total pipeline (772 + 902 = 1674) is currently sufficient to cover this. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (P9-P12) and default for lead time as the logic is stable.

Carry-over insight: May demand remains stable within the April regime of ~290 units/period (P9-P12 avg: 301; P10-P12 avg: 290). No further significant shift detected yet.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a stable demand regime after a significant seasonal drop in early April. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 13 is approximately 277 units/period (269, 261, 339, 241). The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). Currently, the system has 1106 units on-hand and 327 in-transit (from P10). Since the sum of on-hand and pipeline inventory (1433 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~277 units = 1385 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level and ensure the OR backend does not over-order while maintaining the current surplus. N is chosen as 4 to perfectly align with the current stable April-May regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-488.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15 (May 20). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Demand has significantly decreased since mid-April. Looking at the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the demand values are [269, 261, 339, 241, 189], resulting in an average of 259.8 units/period. The current regime is roughly 260-290 units/period, down from the earlier March average of ~480. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P7 through P10 orders arrived exactly at L=4). On-hand inventory is high at 1244 units, and with the recent demand drop, we are overstocked relative to the base stock needs for a 5-period horizon (L+1). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower late-spring demand regime and allow inventory to bleed down naturally. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further at ~260 units/period (P10-P14 avg); significant downshift from March/April levels (-45% from peak).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has entered a stable lower-demand regime for the mid-to-late May period. Demand last period (Period 15) saw a slight uptick to 375, but the overall trend since Period 10 has averaged approximately 279 units per period. The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around 260-290 units. Current on-hand inventory is 869, which is approximately 3 periods of coverage at the current mean. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9, and P10). There were no orders placed in Periods 11, 12, or 13, explaining the lack of arrivals in Period 15 and the high probability of no arrival in the upcoming Period 16. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 10-15) to capture the current lower-demand regime while including the recent volatility seen in Period 15. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Average demand across P10-P15 is 279 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 17 (June 3). Demand has shown a significant upward spike over the last two periods (P15: 375, P16: 533), likely indicating a June/Summer seasonal surge for denim skinny jeans. This breaks the previous low-demand regime observed in April and May (~260-290 units). I am calculating mu_hat based on the last 3 samples (P14-P16 avg: 365.6) to capture this momentum while smoothing. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate following the consistent deliveries observed through Period 14 (P15/P16 had 0 ordered 4 periods prior, so the 0 arrivals are expected). pipeline inventory (548) and on-hand (336) are moderate compared to the rising demand, so my parameters will signal the OR backend to increase base stock levels to prevent stockouts during this potential peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase detected starting Period 15: Demand rose from ~260 to a 533-unit peak in P16 (avg 454 over last 2 periods), marking the start of a June summer trend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim TRS) is entering a higher demand regime typical for June/summer, with demand significantly increasing from a previous average of ~260 to an average of 453 over the last three periods (P15-P17: 375, 533, 451). Currently, 'On-hand' inventory is 0, and sales were lost in Period 17 (sold 336 vs. 451 demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised = actual). There are 1133 units in transit: Period 14 (35), Period 15 (122), Period 16 (391), and Period 17 (585). Period 14's order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 18. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent growth shift (averaging ~453 units per period). I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current volatile demand environment. These parameters will prompt the OR engine to place a large order to replenish the safety stock and cover the expected (L+1) demand window, accounting for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge confirmed: Average demand increased to ~450 units/period (P15-P17), a ~70% increase from the May baseline (~260 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a June demand surge, stabilizing at an average of ~450 units per period (P15-P18 avg: 455). We are currently stock-out because order P11 (0 units), P12 (0 units), and P13 (0 units) were zero due to the previous low-demand regime, and P14 (only 35 units) arrived in P18. The upcoming arrival in P19 (order from P15: 122 units) will not cover the current demand regime, so we are facing stockouts until the P16-P18 orders (391, 585, 583 units) arrive starting in Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the June surge (~455 units), which results in a base stock level calculation for L+1 (5 periods). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this new regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a June summer demand surge with stock-outs occurring over the last three periods (P17-P19) due to insufficient on-hand inventory. The June demand average (P16-P19) is approximately 451 units, significantly higher than the May average (~260 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we are experiencing stock-outs, realized sales are lower than true demand, making the actual demand signal highly relevant. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime (P15-P19), which averages ~436 units per period. Setting L to calculate uses the stable 4-period historical performance to maintain the pipeline. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to satisfy the summer surge and recover from the current zero on-hand position, while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline of 2121 units.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge sustained through late June (P16-P19 average: 451 units). Stock-outs in P17, P18, and P19 confirm that current inventory levels are insufficient for the summer peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are navigating the summer high-demand season for denim trousers. Recent demand history shows a significant shift: from a May low (Period 14-15) to a June peak. Specifically, demand in Period 16-19 averaged ~451 units before a slight dip to 265 in Period 20. However, Periods 17-19 were characterized by severe stock-outs where sales were capped by inventory (0 ending inventory), suggesting that the 'true' historical demand in June was likely higher than recorded sales. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). We are currently in a high-risk state with low on-hand inventory (126) and a large pipeline (1922 units), much of which was ordered during the stock-out phase to recover. To stabilize, I am choosing a recent_N window for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher summer average while account for the P20 dip. For sigma_hat, I am using a smaller window (N=4) to reflect the high volatility experienced during the stock-out regime (P17-P20).

Carry-over insight: July demand baseline established: June average demand (taking into account stock-outs) is approximately 415-450 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which experienced a significant demand surge in June (avg ~450/period). However, the demand in the most recent two periods (P20-P21) has moderated to an average of 309, following several periods of stockouts which likely suppressed observed demand. The carry-over insights suggest a July baseline of 415-450, but actual observed demand in early July (P21) was 353. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the summer surge while smoothing out the recent stockout-impacted data and the moderate P21 observation. The average demand from P16-P21 (including 3 periods of stockouts where demand potentially exceeded supply) is (533+451+462+358+265+353)/6 = 403.6. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P14-P17 orders all arrived with lead_time=4).

Carry-over insight: July demand softening: Avg demand for P20-P21 is 309 units, lower than the June average of ~450, suggesting a potential peak plateau or shift in the summer denim category.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand summer phase, though recent data suggests the peak may be stabilizing or slightly softening compared to the late June surge. Demand for the last three periods (P20-P22) has been 265, 353, and 393, averaging approximately 337 units/period. This is lower than the June peak (~450) but significantly higher than the May baseline (~260). Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P14-P18 arriving exactly on time. With higher demand expected to continue through July, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current July demand level (~337 per period), rather than the June spikes or May lows. This ensures we maintain enough base stock for 5 periods (L+1) without over-ordering as we move toward the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime detected: Average demand for P20-P22 is 337 units, representing a stabilization from the June peak of ~450 units but remaining significantly above the May baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in its July demand regime. Following the June peak (avg ~450+), demand has settled into a lower, stable range. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been 265, 353, 393, and 369, averaging 345 units. This matches the 'July demand regime' identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (P14-P19 orders have all arrived exactly at L=4). For parameters, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-peak July demand. L remains at the promised 4 periods. On-hand + in-transit (741 + 699 = 1440) currently covers approximately 4.1 periods of the current demand mean (~345), which align with the target pipeline for a 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime further stabilized at ~345 units/period (avg P20-P23). Peak summer demand has passed, and volatility has decreased compared to June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in the middle of the July-August transition. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization in July (Periods 20-24) with an average demand of approximately 322 units/period (265, 353, 393, 369, 232). This is a decrease from the June peak of ~450 but remains steady. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the arrivals in P21-P24). On-hand inventory is 701, and in-transit is 898 (orders from P21, P22, P23, P24), totaling 1599 units. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~322, required inventory is ~1610 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this stable July regime (P20-P24) and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime for Skinny Denim stabilized at an average of 322 units/period (Periods 20-24) following the June peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 20-25) has stabilized at an average of 318 units per period (265, 353, 393, 369, 232, 298). This is a decrease from the June peak of ~450. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With August beginning, we expect this stabilized summer demand to continue. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this current regime, which is approximately 1,592 units for the (L+1) period window. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=6 period to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime transition: Post-June peak demand has stabilized at ~318 units/period (avg P20-P25) entering early August. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has entered a stable post-peak summer regime. Over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged 327 units per period, showing a significant reduction from the June peak (~450 units) but remaining consistent through July and early August. The most recent demand (P26) was 381, slightly above the average but within normal variance for this stable phase. Lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods, with every order from P17 through P22 arriving exactly on schedule. Pipeline inventory (803 units) plus on-hand (527 units) totals 1330 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture this post-June stabilization (P20-P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this period represents the current demand regime. L will be set to 'calculate' given the consistent performance of the supply chain.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand surged to 493 units, which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization at ~320. This suggests a late August 'Back to School' peak for high-waisted denim. The current on-hand inventory is very low (36 units). While the pipeline is large (1226 units), most of it consists of orders from Periods 24-27 that are still within the 4-period lead time. Specifically, we expect arrivals in Period 28 (ordered P24, 391 units) and Period 29 (ordered P25, 145 units). Given the recent demand spike, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the last 3 periods of rising demand (avg ~390 units) to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to cover this late-summer surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge detected: Demand increased to 493 in Period 27 (avg P25-P27: 390 units), likely driven by seasonal Back-to-School shopping for denim.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has surged significantly in late August, with the last two periods showing demand of 493 and 432 (average ~463). This aligns with the 'Back-to-School' shopping season for denim. The product is currently stocked out (Ending On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (1362) is substantial, but we must ensure the base stock levels reflect this higher seasonal demand regime to avoid further stock-outs during the lead time (4 periods). I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture this late August surge (P26-P28) which averages 435 units, signaling a clear shift from the previous July/early August average of ~320. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed in late August: Average demand for P26-P28 is 435 units, a ~37% increase from the previous summer baseline of ~318.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30 (2019/9/2). Historical data shows a clear 'Back-to-School' surge in demand for this denim SKU, starting around Period 27 (late August). The average demand for the most recent regime (P27-P29) is 440 units, compared to the previous summer baseline of ~320. Although P29 demand (396) was slightly lower than P27 (493) and P28 (432), it remains significantly elevated. We are currently facing stock-outs (on-hand 0 at start of P30), despite a large pipeline (1745 units), because recent arrivals (145 units in P29) were insufficient for the surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and current stock-out situation, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (approx 440 units/period) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand peak while pipeline orders catch up.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge for Denim sustained: Average demand for P27-P29 is 440 units/period (+38% over July baseline). Stock-outs in P28-P29 confirm urgent inventory need.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a significant Back-to-School/Early Autumn surge. Period 30 demand spiked to 740 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'Back-to-School' average of ~440. This suggests we are in a peak seasonal window for denim. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stock-outs for three consecutive periods (P28-P30), meaning true demand is likely higher than recorded sales. To capture this surge and prevent further lost sales, I am shifting mu_hat to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent demand explosion (Avg P28-P30 = 522.6 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (Period 30 arrived order from Period 26). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=3 as well to reflect the increased volatility during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Peak seasonal surge confirmed with Period 30 demand hitting 740 units. Average demand for the last 3 periods (P28-P30) is 522.6, a significant jump from the previous late-August baseline of 440.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in the middle of a major seasonal peak linked to 'Back-to-School' and early autumn transitions (September). Demand has surged dramatically from a July/August baseline of ~320 units to an average of 615 units over the last three periods (P29-P31: 396, 740, 708). We have experienced stock-outs for four consecutive periods (P28-P31), indicating that current on-hand inventory is severely insufficient. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and stock-out state, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-velocity regime (~3,075 units over review+lead period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this peak. This will signal the OR backend to maximize ordering within the policy cap to rebuild inventory and capture high sales.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal peak confirmed: Demand averaged 615 units/period (P29-P31), a 93% increase over the summer baseline of 318. Stock-outs sustained for 4 periods (P28-P31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September peak of the Back-to-School/Fall denim season. Demand has surged significantly, with the last three periods (P30-P32) recorded at 740, 708, and 707 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to 5 consecutive periods of stock-outs (P28-P32), meaning actual demand may even be slightly higher than these recorded figures. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 718 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the stock-out status, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this high-demand regime (718 units * (1+L) = 3590) to ensure the OR backend generates aggressive orders to capture remaining seasonal demand. Although we have 2811 units in-transit, they will arrive one-by-one over the next 4 periods, and we must maintain a pipeline that covers the current 700+ units/period demand rate.

Carry-over insight: September peak demand confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~718 units/period (avg P30-P32), representing a 125% increase from the late-summer baseline. Sustained stock-outs for 5 periods (P28-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September has shown a massive surge in demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', with Period 33 demand spiking to 1,428 units, far exceeding previous peak estimates. This follows a month-long trend of sustained stock-outs (P28-P33), indicating that current pipeline inventory is insufficient to meet this seasonal high. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P31-P33) is 947.6 units, but given the trajectory and the 1,428 outlier in P33, a more aggressive forecast is required to recover service levels and prevent further lost sales. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) reflects this high-demand regime, while sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last period (700 to 1400 swing).

Carry-over insight: September demand explosion: Period 33 demand reached 1,428 units, more than double the late-August average. Demand regime shifted from ~440 (P27-P29) to ~950+ (P31-P33). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand October seasonal peak for denim. Demand in Period 33 exploded to 1,428 units, followed by 748 units in Period 34. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 866 units/period, compared to the previous late-August baseline of ~440. We have experienced continuous stock-outs since Period 28. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (P30 order arrived in P34, lead_time 4). While the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) periods, the extreme volatility (stdev is very high due to the P33 outlier) and the persistent stock-outs mean we need to ensure mu_hat reflects the current high-velocity regime to recover inventory levels. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent seasonal explosion while acknowledging the P33 peak may be an outlier that inflates sigma.

Carry-over insight: October seasonal peak confirmed: Demand averaged 866 units/period over P30-P34 (up from ~440 in late August). Sustained stock-outs for 7 consecutive periods (P28-P34) indicate significant under-budgeting for the autumn denim surge.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) has experienced a massive seasonal demand surge starting mid-August, peaking in late September (P33 reached 1,428 units). Demand over the last five periods (P31-P35) has averaged ~847 units/period, despite high volatility. Although P35 demand (606) was lower than previous peaks, we are in the heart of the autumn denim season (mid-October). Period 35 finally saw an ending inventory above zero (228 units) after seven periods of stock-outs, as the larger orders from the start of the peak (P31) have begun to arrive. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is very high (4,090 units) due to aggressive ordering in P32-P35. To avoid excessive holding costs if the peak demand subsides, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5), which captures the high-demand regime while allowing for the recent slight softening in the demand signal.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains high but volatile; Period 35 demand (606) is lower than the September peak but the 5-period average (P31-P35) remains high at ~847 units. Pipeline inventory is currently significant (4,090 units) to address previous stock-outs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), we are navigating the aftermath of the massive September/October-peak for denim. Demand has shifted from a chaotic peak of ~1,400 to a more stable but still elevated level. The last three periods (P34-P36) show demands of 748, 606, and 581, averaging 645 units/period. This represents a cooling from the 'explosion' phase but remains nearly double the summer baseline. The pipeline is currently very heavy (3,669 units) as a result of aggressive ordering during the stock-out phase (P28-P34). On-hand inventory has finally recovered (575 units). Lead time remains reliably at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent 3-period average for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current post-peak stabilization while maintaining the 4-period lead time. This allows the OR backend to start throttling orders as the pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 5-6 periods of demand at current rates.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Demand has transitioned from the September peak (~950+) to an October average of ~645 units/period (P34-P36), a ~30% reduction from the explosive phase but still 100% higher than July levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has transitioned from an explosive September peak (~950+ units) to a stabilized October regime. Recent demand (P34-P37) has clustered around an average of 645 units/period (748, 606, 581, 643). This represents a ~30% reduction from the peak, but remains high compared to summer levels. Pipeline inventory is currently very high (2,675 units) due to aggressive ordering during the stock-out phase, which is now starting to arrive (994 units arrived in P37, and 1,242 units ordered in P34 are expected soon). The on-hand inventory has recovered to 926 units. Setting mu_hat to the recent 4-period average (645 * 5 = 3225) using recent_N=4 will allow the OR backend to reconcile this high pipeline and likely skip ordering this period to prevent excessive holding costs as the seasonal peak continues to cool into late October.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand transitioned from September surge (~950+) to an October baseline of ~645 units/period (avg P34-P37). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in early November (P39). Demand analysis confirms a stabilization after the explosive September peak. The October-November regime (P34-P38) shows an average demand of approximately 648 units/period (606, 581, 643, 663). While significantly lower than the P33 localized peak of 1,428, it remains substantially higher than the summer baseline (~320). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 1,505 units on-hand and 1,433 units in-transit (reflecting large orders from P35-P36 reaching arrival), our pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover near-term demand. The target is to align the OR backend with this new post-peak baseline of ~650 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized October/November demand pattern specifically.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization confirmed: October/early November average demand (P35-P38) is 623 units/period, roughly 35% lower than the September peak but consistent across 4 weeks. Transitioning to a post-peak maintenance regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has stabilized into a post-peak November regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is approximately 597 units. Period 39 demand specifically dropped to 485 units, signaling a further step down from the October average of ~645 units. With the current supply chain state (on-hand: 1946, in-transit: 931, total pipeline: 2877), we are well-covered for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) at the projected demand rate (~3000 units needed vs 2877 available). I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this stabilized, lower demand level using a recent 5-period average (P35-P39) to prevent excessive holding costs as we exit the peak season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: November demand step-down: Average demand for P35-P39 is 597 units, with the most recent sample (P39) at 485, indicating a transition from the October baseline (~645) to a late-autumn level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized into a late-autumn regime. Following the September explosive peak (approx. 950+ units) and the October plateau (~645 units), the last two periods (P39-P40) show a step-down to an average of 533 units. This downward trend aligns with seasonal expectations as the market transitions from autumn denim surges toward late November/early December. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 1,872 units following the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. Pipeline inventory is low (656 units), reflecting reduced ordering during the stabilization phase. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P38-P40) to capture the recent step-down (576 average) while maintaining a buffer for seasonal volatility using recent_N for sigma_hat. This approach prevents excessive inventory accumulation as we exit the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime step-down confirmed mid-November: Average demand for P39-P40 is 533 units, representing a ~17% decrease from the October baseline (~645).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the demand for high-waisted jeans has transitioned into a late-autumn maintenance phase. The explosive September spike (~1000+) and October plateau (~645) have given way to a consistent November level. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P39-P41) is 537.7 units, and the last 6 periods (P36-P41) is 583.3 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~550) to reflect this step-down while maintaining some buffer for late-season shoppers. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 1,325 and in-transit at 1,141, the backend calculation will maintain a base stock to cover (1+L) periods, which is roughly 2,750 units. My current total inventory position (2,466) is slightly below this, and the OR engine will order the difference to maintain the target service level.

Carry-over insight: November demand stabilization: Period 39-41 average demand is 538 units, confirming a ~17% decline from the October baseline (~645).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand exploded to 3,100 units, significantly exceeding the previous baseline of ~540. This is a clear Black Friday/Cyber Monday surge for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' category. We are currently stocked out (on-hand 0). Given the date (Dec 2), we are entering the holiday shopping season. Historical actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (1,731 units) is insufficient to cover the high demand observed in the most recent period. Although Period 42's demand is likely an outlier peak, the surrounding periods in December will remain elevated compared to November. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the severity of the surge for mu_hat (to force an aggressive restock) and N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the massive spike in volatility. This will increase the base stock level significantly to recover availability and prepare for December demand.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge detected in Period 42: demand jumped from ~540 to 3,100 units (>470% increase). Inventory is currently depleted, requiring aggressive replenishment for the holiday season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive Black Friday demand surge of 3,100 units, followed by a stabilization back to 674 units in Period 43. The current date (2019/12/9) places us in the early December holiday shopping window. History suggests that late December/Christmas often maintains elevated demand for staples like denim, though perhaps not at peak Black Friday levels. The large order placed in Period 43 (5,509 units) combined with significant existing in-transit inventory (total pipeline 6,816) addresses the immediate stock-out situation. Based on the demand profile, the September peak averaged ~950 units, while current late-autumn base levels were ~540. To avoid further stock-outs while accounting for the likely post-Black Friday plateau, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 3,500 (representing a weekly forecast of ~700 units over L+1 = 5 periods) and an explicit sigma_hat of 600 to handle potential late-December volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge confirmed in P42 (3,100 units). P43 demand (674) indicates a return to a high-maintenance holiday regime (~700 units/period) rather than sustained hyper-growth.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday holiday shopping period. The sudden demand spike to 3,100 units in Period 42 was a classic Black Friday event, while subsequent demand (P43: 674, P44: 680) shows a return to a high-maintenance holiday baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P40 order arrived P44). The massive order of 5,509 units in Period 43 has entered the pipeline but will not arrive until Period 47 (P43+4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 6,584 units in-transit. Since the pipeline (6,584) already significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (approximately 5 * 700 = 3,500), no additional order is needed to avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game (ending at P47). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the post-spike holiday stabilization (~680 per period) while letting the OR backend realize the pipeline is already full.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime stabilized post-Black Friday at ~680 units/period (avg P43-P44). Pipeline is heavily saturated with P43 replenishment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 46 (Late December), following a major Black Friday surge (P42: 3,100 units) and stabilization into a holiday maintenance regime (P43-P45 avg: 670 units). While currently at zero on-hand due to the logic of the previous surge, a massive pipeline of 9,571 units is inbound, primarily from orders in Period 43 (5,509 units) and Period 45 (3,472 units). The order placed in Period 42 (590 units) is expected to arrive this period (P46), which will satisfy current demand. Given the stock-out status, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally attempt to order more to cover the 'gap'. However, the current pipeline is nearly 15 times the current weekly demand, suggesting that any further 'default' orders would lead to excessive holding costs in January. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the post-Black Friday holiday baseline (~670 units/period) while maintaining the lead time at the stable 4 periods. The OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering, and with the massive in-transit volume, the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic should result in a zero or minimal order this period, which is optimal given the impending inventory glut.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime stabilized post-Black Friday (P43-P45) at an average of 670 units/period. Massive inventory pipeline (9,571 units) created in Dec will likely exceed January demand requirements.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 47 (late December/early January). The major demand events (September peak, Black Friday surge, and December holidays) are concluding. Recent demand (P46: 475) indicates a return to a standard maintenance regime, slightly lower than the early December average (~670). The most critical factor is the massive pipeline inventory of 8,981 units, primarily from the P43 and P45 catch-up orders (5,509 and 3,472 units respectively). These units were ordered during high-volatility periods, but with recent demand dropping below 500, we are at significant risk of overstocking as they arrive in January. The OR backend with 'default' parameters might keep ordering because it weights the huge P42/P43 demand spikes and recent stock-outs heavily. To prevent further unnecessary orders and minimize holding costs on top of the already excessive pipeline, I am using a longer recent window (N=15) for mu_hat to include the stable October/November history (~600 units) which effectively dilutes the late-season spikes while still respecting the underlying volume of the SKU better than a very short-term window. sigma_hat is also set to a recent window of 10 to capture the post-September volatility without being dominated solely by the Black Friday outlier.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand step-down: Period 46 demand (475) indicates a transition away from the ~670-unit Dec holiday regime toward a lower January baseline. Pipeline inventory (8,981) is significantly over-saturated for current demand levels.
