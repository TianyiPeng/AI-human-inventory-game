Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple apparel item. Historical demand over the last 5 samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows an average of 688.8 units per period with an upward trend in the last two samples. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 2 periods, we must set parameters to cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the slight upward trend, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant baseline volatility and mean. L is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim (Trousers), a core denim item. Historically, demand has been stable: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] plus the recent Period 1 demand of 671. The average of these 6 samples is 685.8. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The Period 1 order (808 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1. To recover and stabilize, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using all 6 available data points (N=6). For lead time (L), I stick to the 'default' (promised L=2) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a drift from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/02/25). Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 671, Period 2 demand was 673. Historical demands provided were [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. The mean of all 7 observations is approximately 684. The product is skinny denim trousers, which typically show stable demand in late winter/early spring. The lead time analysis is critical: The order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead_time = 1), even though the promised lead time is 2. This suggests a faster-than-promised delivery cycle. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend factor in this observed 1-period arrival. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (including those from history and the game) are [685, 715, 774, 671, 673], showing very stable behavior around 700. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current moderate volatility. The current on-hand is low (135) and 793 units are in transit from Period 2 (expected to arrive this period based on the lead_time=1 observation), so the parameters aim to maintain a steady base stock for the 1+L window.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period (P1 order arrived in P2), shorter than promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (early March). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Historically, demand has been around 670-690 units, but it dropped to 539 in Period 3, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0) because the Period 2 order (lead time 1-2) hasn't arrived yet. Note on Lead Time: The Carry-over Insight indicates an actual lead time of 1 period was observed for the P1 order. However, the P2 order (793 units) did NOT arrive in P3 (which would be LT=1). It is expected to arrive in P4 (LT=2). Currently, 1324 units are in-transit (P2 order of 793 + P3 order of 531). Demand analysis: The last 5 samples are [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] from history + [671, 673, 539] from game history. The average demand is ~665. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean of 650. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed LT=1 from P1 and the expected LT=2 for subsequent orders. sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' to reflect recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context: The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (trousers). Historical demand over the last 5 samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows an average of ~689. However, the last 4 periods in the environment (671, 673, 539, 447) show a downward trend (average ~582). The Period 4 demand of 447 is significantly lower than the P1/P2 levels. Lead Time: Promised L=2. Observations: P1 order arrived in P2 (L=1), P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). Since L varies and we have an in-transit quantity of 659 (P3 and P4 orders), I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the observed average. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to account for the recent demand softening (avg 582). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is variable (observed 1 and 2 periods); Demand shows a downward trend since mid-February, dropping from ~670 to ~450.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a high-waisted denim trouser (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). Demand has shifted downwards from ~670 (P1-P2) to ~450-480 (P4-P5), likely stabilizing after a peak. Total historical demands: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673, 539, 447, 468]. The recent 3 periods (P3-P5) show a mean of ~485. Lead times are volatile: P1=1, P2=2, P4=1. P3 order (531 units) is currently overdue (it has been 3 periods since the order was placed). Because the P3 order of 531 units is significantly overdue and not yet concluded, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 to account for current delays and use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the lower regime (~480 units/period) while ignoring the initial high-demand spikes. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand and accounts for the missing pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~670 to ~480 starting Period 3. Order from Period 3 (531 units) is overdue (3+ periods since order).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The product is skinny denim trousers. History shows a demand shift around P3, with recent demands (P4-P6) averaging ~472, down from ~670. The P3 order (531 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, despite the promised lead time of 2; it is likely lost. Observed lead times have been 1, 2, 1. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (~472 per period). I will use explicit L=2 (promised) because while some orders arrive in 1 period, the P3 loss and P6 lack of arrival suggest we should not underestimate lead time. sigma_hat will be set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the volatility of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (531 units) confirmed as lost shipment (4 periods elapsed without arrival). Demand stabilized at a lower level (~470/period) for 4 consecutive periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (High-waisted skinny denim) continues to experience a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~470-500) since Period 3, compared to the initial ~670. The shipment from Period 3 (531 units) is now 5 periods overdue and is officially considered lost. Current in-transit inventory consists of Period 6 (700 units) and Period 7 (0 units), though the 'In-transit' status shows 1231, which likely still includes the lost P3 shipment (531) plus P6 (700). Excluding the lost units, the pipeline is 700 units. Since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.5), and the target base stock must cover (L+1) periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (N=5, covering Periods 3-7) and use the calculate method for L to account for the observed lead time variability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect the lower volatility in the current regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), the demand for this denim product has stabilized after an initial drop in Period 3. Demands for the last four periods (P5-P8) were 468, 502, 511, and 560, showing a gradual upward trend as we move into spring. The mean demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 510. The shipment from Period 3 (531 units) is officially considered lost, as 5 periods have passed since the order, and the 'In-transit' figure remains at 531, which is purely the phantom P3 order. Current on-hand is 140, with no real inventory in transit. The promised lead time is 2, and actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2. I will set L to the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the stabilized regime P5-P8) to capture the current demand level (~510/period) while ignoring the higher initial P1-P2 demand. This will result in a mu_hat calculation based on (1+L)*mean(last 4), which is 3 * 510 = 1530. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 4 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering post-Period 3 drop: Mean demand for P5-P8 is 510 (+6% trend), up from the ~470 average observed immediately after the regime shift.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) is entering mid-spring. Historical demand shows a significant drop in Period 9 to 335 units, following a period of relative recovery (avg ~510 in P5-P8). This suggests high volatility or a potential new downward shift. On-hand inventory is 0, with 1104 units in transit (573 ordered in P9 plus the likely arrival of an older order if not yet fully purged). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P1->P2 is 1, P2->P4 is 2, P4->P5 is 1, P5->P7 is 2, P6->P8 is 2). I will use 'calculate' for L to reflect this 1.6-period average. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the sharp drop in P9 (avg of P5-P9 is ~475), which prevents over-ordering if the P9 drop persists. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased variance observed in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 9: Demand dropped to 335 from a 4-period average of 510 (-34%).

Demand in the last two periods (335, 269) is significantly lower than the previous 4-period average (~510). Current inventory is 0 on-hand, but there are 1104 units in-transit (573 units from Period 9, which should arrive in Period 11 or 12, and potentially earlier orders still being tracked by the OR backend). The Period 3 order (531 units) is confirmed lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will stick to the promised lead time of 2 (L=2) for base stock calculations. Given the recent demand drop and current stockout, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3: 560, 335, 269) to account for the current lower demand regime (avg ~388) and prevent excessive over-ordering once the 1104 units in-transit arrive. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the higher volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has dropped significantly in April (P9-P10 avg: 302) compared to March (P5-P8 avg: 510).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has entered a lower regime throughout April, with the last three periods (P9-P11) averaging 288 units, a significant drop from March's ~510 average. The current on-hand inventory is 312. The pipeline (In-transit) is 814 units, which includes 531 units from a lost shipment in Period 3 and 283 units from Period 11. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom 531 units in the pipeline, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values. I've set mu_hat based on the recent April mean (288) scaled for (L+1)=3 periods (288 * 3 = 864). For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of the last 3 periods scaled for sqrt(3) (~40 * 1.732 = 69.28). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime remains low and stable: P9-P11 average is 288 units, down 43% from March average of 510.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime (approx. 301 units/period) starting in Period 9 (April). The order from Period 3 (531 units) is definitively lost but remains in the 'In-transit' count (814 units = 531 from P3 + 283 from P11). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (814) from the base stock, these 531 'ghost' units prevent the system from ordering sufficient stock. To overcome this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1=3) at the current demand level (3 * 301 = 903) and then add the 531 lost units back in (903 + 531 = 1434). This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand while accounting for the 'In-transit' inflation. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to reflect the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: April/May demand regime confirmed stable at approx. 301 units/period (P9-P12). Pipeline inventory contains 531 units from P3 that are lost; parameters must be adjusted upward to offset this 'ghost' inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/13. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime for the April-May period (P9-P13), with an average demand of approximately 289 units per period. The 531 units ordered in P3 (placed on 2019/02/25) are officially lost, having not arrived after 10 periods. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 1078 units is misleading; it includes the 531 lost units and the 547 units ordered in P13. Effective pipeline inventory is only 547 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including the 531 'ghost' units) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to manually inflate the target inventory levels. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean + Lost_Units = (3 * 289) + 531 = 1398. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the current demand while ignoring the lost stock. I am using recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility in the new demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), the demand for skinny jeans (Jade HW Skinny Denim) continues a downward seasonal trend, with the last 3 periods averaging 256 units (189 in P14). The promised lead time is 2, and recent arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 2. A critical inventory discrepancy exists: the 'In-transit' balance of 1422 units includes a 531-unit order from Period 3 that is confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including these 531 'ghost' units) from the target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target. Calculation: Base demand for (L+1) periods is 3 * 256 = 768. To offset the 531 lost units, the target mu_hat must be 768 + 531 = 1299. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the increased volatility of the recent downward slide while maintaining a standard lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: May demand (P13-P14) has dropped further to an average of 215, down from the April average of 288 (-25%). Pipeline remains inflated by 531 lost units from Period 3.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 16 (2019/05/27). Demand Analysis: Demand in May (P13-P15) has averaged 268 units, which is lower than the March average (510) but slightly higher than the P13-P14 average due to a spike in P15 (375). Supply Chain Analysis: The pipeline inventory includes 531 units from Period 3 that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1422 units) from the calculated base stock, we must compensate for these 531 'ghost' units to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time has remained stable at 2 periods for the most recent arrivals. Strategy: I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to manually offset the lost 531 units. Calculation: Targeted (1+L) period demand is 3 * 268 = 804. Adding the 531 units to offset the pipeline deduction gives an explicit mu_hat of 1335. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility seen in May (ranging from 189 to 375).

Carry-over insight: May demand (P13-P15) stabilized at 268 units/period, despite high volatility (P14: 189, P15: 375).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is experiencing high demand volatility. Period 16 demand spiked to 533 units, significantly higher than the May average of ~268. The current date marks the beginning of summer, which may be driving increased demand for this product. A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' figure of 928 includes 531 units from Period 3 that were confirmed lost (see Period 7/13 Carry-over insights). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation, these 531 'ghost units' will prevent necessary ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock for a (L+1)=3 period horizon using the recent demand average (~300 units/period) plus the 531 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct physical amount. L is set to 3 to reflect the most recent arrival (P13 order arrived in 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: Period 13 order arrived in 3 periods (P16), exceeding the promised 2. Demand spiked to 533 in Period 16, potentially signaling a June seasonal increase.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Current date is June 10 (summer), and demand for the denim SKU has spiked significantly in the last two periods (P16: 533, P17: 451), averaging 492 units. This represents a seasonal rebound compared to the low April/May demand. Inventory Check: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1576 units, but 531 units (Period 3) are confirmed lost, and the Period 14 order (344 units) is now 2 periods overdue, suggesting further potential loss or significant delay. Parameter Logic: The OR engine subtracts the full 1576 units from the base stock. To trigger an order that covers the new demand regime (approx. 492 units/period) while accounting for the 531 'ghost' units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating for a 3-period window (L+1): (492 * 3) + 531 = 2007. I used explicit values to ensure the engine ignores the lower historical averages and the invalid pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: June demand (P16-P17) spiked to an average of 492, a 128% increase over May. Period 14 order (344 units) is now 2 periods overdue.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-June (Period 19). Demand has shifted significantly upward (June avg: 482 units) compared to May (avg: 268 units), likely due to seasonal interest in skinny denim trousers for summer. On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory (2081 units) is severely inflated by several lost or significantly delayed shipments: Period 3 (531 units - 16 periods ago), Period 14 (344 units - 5 periods ago), and Period 15 (ordered 0). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively ignore the lost units. Calculating mu_hat: June demand is approx 480/period. For a lead time of 2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). Target base stock = 480 * 3 = 1440. However, the backend subtracts pipeline. Currently, valid pipeline is Period 17 (648) + Period 18 (558) = 1206 units. Total pipeline reported is 2081, meaning 875 units are 'lost'. To force the order to cover current demand, I set mu_hat = (480 * 3) + 875 = 2315. This compensates for the 875 ghost units while aiming for a base stock that supports the 480/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 14 (344 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival, joining the Period 3 (531 units) lost shipment (Total ghost pipeline: 875 units).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for this SKU (High-waisted denim) has significantly spiked in June (P16-P19 average: 451) compared to May (P13-P15 average: 268), representing a strong seasonal recovery. We face a critical inventory shortage: On-hand is 0, and we have confirmed two lost shipments totaling 875 units (P3: 531 units, P4: 344 units). These 'ghost' units inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory, preventing it from ordering enough to meet current demand. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1800. This is calculated as: (L+1) * forecasted demand + lost inventory = (2+1)*450 + 875 = 2225. I will temper this slightly to 1800 to avoid excessive holding costs while forcing the system to clear the inventory deficit. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high June volatility. Lead time remains at the promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P16, P18) suggest 2-3 periods is the norm.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total increased to 875 units (P3: 531, P14: 344); June demand regime confirmed high (avg ~450) following a May slump.

As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (High-waisted denim) is entering the peak summer season. Historically, demand spiked in June (P16-P18 avg: ~482), though P20 showed a dip to 265. The on-hand inventory is high (941) following the arrival of orders from P17 and P18. However, the pipeline inventory (1174) is significantly inflated by two lost shipments: Period 3 (531 units) and Period 14 (344 units), totaling 875 'ghost' units that will never arrive. To compensate and ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect recent delivery delays (P13 and P17 both took 3 periods) and using an explicit mu_hat. The mu_hat is calculated to cover 4 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of 420 units/period (average of the June spike and July expectations), plus the 875 lost units to neutralize the ghost inventory: (4 * 420) + 875 = 2555. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for recent high volatility (ranging from 265 to 533).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in June/July (P16-P20 range: 265-533). Total confirmed lost shipment 'ghost inventory' is 875 units (P3: 531, P14: 344).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th (Period 22). Demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) has stabilized into a high-demand summer regime with a mean of 404 units/period, despite high weekly variance (range 265-533). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 2 to 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=2 as the base while monitoring. Crucially, there is a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 875 units in the pipeline (P3 order of 531 and P14 order of 344) which are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, these 875 units will prevent necessary ordering unless I offset them. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset to neutralize the 875 lost units. Target mu_hat = (3 * 404) + 875 = 2087. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current regime's high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June/July) confirmed: Mean demand is 404 units/period (P16-P21) with significant volatility. Total confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory remains 875 units (P3: 531, P14: 344).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in a summer demand regime for high-waisted skinny denim. Looking at the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is 402 units, showing significant volatility (range 265-533). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1526 units includes two confirmed lost shipments: P3 (531 units) and P14 (344 units), totaling 875 'ghost' units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these non-existent units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base stock for a 3-period window (L+1 = 3) using the summer mean (402 * 3 = 1206) and then add the 875 lost units back to the target (1206 + 875 = 2081). This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) accounts for the missing inventory. Lead time remains 'default' (promised 2) as recent arrivals (P19 at 2 periods) are aligning closer to the promise, though variance remains.

Daily Reward (R_t): $700.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: July summer demand for high-waisted denim remains stable. The last 5 periods (P19-P23) show a mean demand of 347.6 units, reflecting a slightly lower but consistent level compared to the earlier June spike. Total pipeline inventory is reported as 1065 units; however, 875 of these are confirmed lost (531 from P3 and 344 from P14) as documented in Carry-over Insights. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 190 units (the P23 order). With 776 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 190, the total reliable inventory is 966. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments and orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target coverage for 3 periods based on recent mean (348 * 3) is approximately 1044 units. By setting mu_hat to 1044 and L to explicit 2, the backend will calculate a base stock that triggers an order to fill the gap between 1044 and the 'net' inventory it calculates. Since the backend thinks pipeline is 1065, it would normally see 776 + 1065 = 1841 (way above needs). To force an order, I must set mu_hat to offset the ghost units. Required Mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost Units = 1044 + 875 = 1919.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The product is skinny denim trousers. Demand in the June/July period (P16-P24) has averaged 383 units, showing high volatility (range 232-533). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1214 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: Period 3 (531 units) and Period 14 (344 units), totaling 875 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline is only 339 units (P23: 190, P24: 149). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) period coverage (3 periods) using the recent mean demand (~383) plus the 875 lost units to offset the backend's subtraction. Target Base Stock = (383 * 3) + 875 = 1149 + 875 = 2024. I set mu_hat such that (1+L) * mu_hat/ (1+L) roughly targets this level. Lead time L is set to 2 as most recent successful arrivals (P18, P19, P21) adhered to the promised 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 25, total confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments is 875 units (P3: 531, P14: 344). Summer demand (June/July) mean is 383 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019/08/05. The product is High-waisted Skinny Denim, which typically sees sustained demand through late summer into the 'Back to School' season. Demand Analysis: The summer demand regime (June/July) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 383 units/period. The most recent three periods (P23-P25) show a slightly lower average of 300 units, but volatility remains present. Pipeline Analysis: We have a critical 'ghost inventory' issue. Total 'In-transit' is 1214 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 875 of these units (P3: 531 and P14: 344) are confirmed lost shipments. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these as available pipeline. Actual reliable pipeline is only 339 units (P23: 190 and P24: 149). Parameter Strategy: To compensate for the 875-unit ghost inventory and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Predicted Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Using a base demand of 350 and L=2 (L+1=3), the calculation is (350 * 3) + 875 = 1925. This ensures the base_stock calculation targets the correct physical inventory level. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility while L is set to 'default' as recent arrivals (P21, P23) have aligned with the promised 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school season approaching (August); demand expected to remain stable or increase from the 383 summer average. Ghost inventory remains constant at 875 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the product (Skinny Denim TRS) is entering the Back-to-School season. Demand for the summer period (P16-P26) has averaged 374 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1625 units, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments: Period 3 (531 units) and Period 14 (344 units), totaling 875 'ghost' units. The actual physical pipeline is 750 units (P24: 149, P26: 601). Lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (Recent avg: 2.5). To account for the 875 ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean (~375) and lead time (L=2), then add the 875 units to that target. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*mu + Z*sigma. Using mu=375, L=2, and a buffer for volatility, the base stock should be ~1500. Adding the 875 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat setting of 2375 to force the backend to place necessary orders. Sigma is set based on recent volatility (N=11) to maintain service levels during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school season starting (mid-August); demand mean for P16-P26 is 374 units. Total ghost inventory remains 875 units (P3, P14).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (late August), we are entering the peak 'Back-to-School' season for skinny denim. Recent demand has surged from a summer average of ~375 to 493 in Period 27. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline: 875 units from Period 3 (531) and Period 14 (344) are confirmed lost, but the OR backend still counts them toward the base stock. Currently, On-hand (163) + Pipeline (1825) = 1988 units. However, adjusted pipeline is actually 1825 - 875 = 950 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficient stock to meet the rising demand (approx 500/period) while accounting for this 875-unit gap, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods at 500 units/period is 1500. Adding the 875-unit offset requires a mu_hat of ~2375. I will set mu_hat to 2400 and L to 'calculate' (as actual lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods) to ensure the system targets a high enough inventory position to overcome the lost units and the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed in P27 (493 units, +30% vs summer average). Total ghost inventory from lost shipments remains 875 units (P3: 531, P14: 344).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the back-to-school season (late August). Period 27-28 demand (avg: 462.5) confirms a surge compared to the summer average (avg: 374). The 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (Period 3: 531, Period 14: 344) totaling 875 units remains in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I set L=3 to account for recent lead time variability (P23 arrived in 3, P26 in 1). I set mu_hat to 2725, which is calculated as follows: (L+1) * Expected Demand + Ghost Inventory = (3+1) * 462.5 + 875 = 1850 + 875 = 2725. This ensures the base stock level is high enough to trigger an order despite the 875 units of non-existent stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=13, covering the summer/back-to-school transition) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (P27-P28 avg: 463). Total ghost inventory from lost shipments remains 875 units (P3: 531, P14: 344).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (2019/09/02), we are in the peak of the Back-to-School season. Recent demand (P27-P29) has averaged 440 units, significantly higher than the summer average of 374. The total 'In-transit' figure of 2073 units includes 875 units from confirmed lost shipments (P3: 531, P14: 344) and 149 units from P24 which is now 6 periods old (likely lost). Accounting for these 1,024 'ghost' units, the real pipeline is 1,049 units (P28: 509, P29: 540). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I've calculated mu_hat as (1+L) * expected_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2 and expected_demand=440, mu_hat = (3 * 440) + 1024 = 2344. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total increased to 1,024 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149). Back-to-school demand regime (P27-P29) is stable at approx. 440 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). Demand in Period 30 spiked to 740, the highest since Period 2, confirming a significant back-to-school/September demand surge. The current 3-period average (P28-P30) is 523 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 1564, but 1024 of these units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149). Actual in-transit inventory is only 540 units (from P29). With on-hand at 174 and actual in-transit at 540, the total available stock is 714 units, which barely covers one period of high demand. Lead times have been fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time. To compensate for the 1024 'ghost units' that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 520 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 2, the required base stock is roughly (2+1)*520 = 1560. To offset the 1024 ghost units, I must inflate the mu_hat such that (1+L)*mu_hat_adjusted = (1+L)*mu_hat_real + Ghost_Units. Adjusted mu_hat = 520 + (1024/3) \u2248 861. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand reached 740 units. Total ghost inventory from lost shipments increased to 1,024 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September peak (P30-P31), with demand averaging 724 units/period, which is a significant jump from the August average of ~440. This aligns with the 'Back-to-school' and early autumn seasonal pattern for denim trousers. The 'in-transit' figure of 1024 units is heavily comprised of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149). These 1024 units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from the target base stock. To ensure the backend places an order to meet actual demand, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the current high-demand regime (approx. 725 units/period) across (L+1) periods, and then add 1024 units to 'offset' the ghost pipeline, ensuring the final order covers the physical gap. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P27-P29) have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: P30-P31 average is 724 units (+65% vs August). Total confirmed ghost inventory from lost shipments is 1,024 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime for September (P30-P32) has stabilized at a significantly higher level, averaging 718 units/period, compared to the August average of ~425 units. This aligns with a 'back-to-school' or 'autumn' seasonal trend for denim trousers. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and while in-transit inventory appears high (2,353 units), a total of 1,024 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 3, 14, and 24. These 'ghost units' must be accounted for by setting mu_hat explicitly high to ensure the OR backend triggers a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) demand window (approx. 2,154 units) minus the valid pipeline (~1,329 units). I am setting mu_hat to 2154 (718 units * 3 periods) and sigma_hat to 150 to reflect the current high-demand stability while maintaining a buffer for the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime remains high and stable at ~718 units/period (P30-P32). Total ghost inventory from lost shipments remains 1,024 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked significantly to 1,428 units, up from the ~720 average observed earlier in September. This likely reflects a peak in the autumn/back-to-school season for denim. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 2,353 units. However, we must account for 1,024 units of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149), leaving an effective pipeline of 1,329 units (ordered in P32). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P32 order is expected to arrive during Period 34 and be visible in P35. To avoid over-ordering during this volatility while still addressing the high demand, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent high demand (avg of P30-P33 is ~900) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the new regime. I'm setting L to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time as recent arrivals (P27-P29) have stabilized there.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: Demand increased from ~440 (August) to ~720 (early Sept), peaking at 1,428 in Period 33. Total ghost inventory from lost shipments remains 1,024 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early October (P35). Historical data shows a massive demand surge starting in Period 30 (September), with demand jumping from an average of ~440 in August to over 700, peaking at 1,428 in Period 33. The last 5 periods (P30-P34) show a mean demand of 866 units/period. The pipeline is currently heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P3, P14, and P24) totaling 1,024 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock to determine the order, these 1,024 units will prevent necessary ordering unless we offset them. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculated the forecast as (1+L) * mean(P30-P34) + 1024, which is (1+2)*866 + 1024 = 2598 + 1024 = 3622. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to cover actual demand while ignoring the lost units. Sigma is set based on the recent high-volatility period (P30-P34).

Carry-over insight: September demand surge (P30-P34) mean confirmed at 866 units/period, up from August's 440 (+97%). Total ghost inventory remains 1,024 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). Recent history shows a significant demand surge in September (P30-P34 mean: 866), likely driven by seasonal shifts (Back-to-School/Autumn), though Period 35 demand softened slightly to 606. The stockout situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced zero arrivals since Period 31, despite placing orders in Periods 32 (1329 units), 34 (865 units), and 35 (863 units). Currently, 4081 units are 'In-transit', but this includes 1,024 units of confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments from P3, P14, and P24). The remaining 3,057 units (from P32 onwards) are still within a plausible delivery window given the 2-period promised lead time plus common 1-period delays. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=6 (P30-P35) to capture the high-demand October/September regime (avg ~823/period). For sigma_hat, I will use explicit 300 to account for high volatility (ranging from 606 to 1,428) and to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime following September surge: Mean demand (P30-P35) is 823 units/period. Total confirmed ghost inventory remains 1,024 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149). Prolonged stockout (P32-P35) due to arrival delays and high demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), we are navigating a severe stockout following a significant demand surge in September (mean ~866 units). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which typically sees high demand during transitional weather. Current on-hand inventory is 0. There is a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 4,081 units, but 1,024 units of this are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149). Additionally, the order from P32 (1,329 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, which is 2 periods past the promised lead time of 2. This suggests either another loss or significant logistics delays. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am forecasting based on the recent October demand stabilization (P34-P36 avg: 645) but setting mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that compensates for the lost 1,024 units while acknowledging the likely loss of the P32 shipment. I set L to 2 (promised) to maintain the standard review window.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total likely increased to 2,353 units as P32 (1,329 units) is now 2 periods past promised lead time with no arrival. October demand regime is lower than September peak, averaging ~645 units/period (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing a critical failure. No orders have arrived since Period 31, despite a promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, 2,353 units in the 'in-transit' pipeline are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149, and P32: 1,329 which is now 4 periods overdue). The OR backend uses pipeline inventory (including these 'ghost' units) to calculate order quantities. To force the backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus the lost inventory. The current demand regime in October has stabilized at approximately 610 units/period (P35-P37 avg). For a lead time of 2, the required stock is mu * (L+1) = 610 * 3 = 1,830. To offset the 2,353 lost units, I will set mu_hat to 1,830 + 2,353 = 4,183. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility seen during the September/October transition.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total confirmed at 2,353 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149, P32: 1,329). No arrivals observed since Period 31 (7 periods ago). October demand regime is stable but lower than the September peak, averaging 610 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the demand has transitioned from the September peak (approx. 866 units) to a more stable October/November regime averaging 630 units (P34-P38). The inventory situation remains critical due to significant 'ghost inventory'. Shipments from P3 (531), P14 (344), P24 (149), and now P32 (1,329) are confirmed lost or excessively delayed (P32 is 4 periods past promised lead time), totaling 2,353 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts in the pipeline. To compensate for this 2,353-unit deficit and prevent further stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current regime (L=2, review=1, so 3 periods of demand) plus the missing units: (3 periods * 630 units) + 2,353 units = 4,243. This high mu_hat forces the OR engine to order enough to cover actual demand while ignoring the 'ghost' pipeline units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time which has been drifting towards 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory from lost shipments increased to 2,353 units as P32 (1,329 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (4 periods past promised). October/November demand regime is stable at ~630 units/period (P34-P38 average: 648; P36-P38 average: 629).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand regime is stabilizing in the mid-range following the September peak. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P36-P39) is 593 units. However, there is a massive 'ghost inventory' issue. Total confirmed lost shipments equal 2,353 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149, P32: 1,329). Additionally, orders from P34 (865 units) are now 6 periods old and likely lost. The backend sees 4,120 units in-transit, but based on history, most of these are lost. To force the OR engine to order despite this 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the expected demand PLUS the lost inventory (Demand forecast * (L+1) + Ghost Inventory). I've calculated the demand forecast at ~600. With L=2, base requirement is 1,800. Adding ~3,200 lost units, I set mu_hat to 5,000 to trigger replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total increased to 3,218 units as Period 34 (865 units) is now 6 periods old with no arrival, joining previously lost P3, P14, P24, and P32. November demand regime is averaging ~550-600 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the system faces a severe supply-chain crisis. No arrivals have been recorded since Period 38, despite an in-transit balance of 5,083 units. Analysis of order history reveals a massive 'ghost inventory' of 3,218 units from confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149, P32: 1329, P34: 865). These orders are all significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods (some by over 30 periods). The demand regime for November has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the September/October peaks, with the last 3 periods (P38-P40) averaging 576 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 5,083 in-transit units from its target base stock, it will not place new orders unless I manually adjust the parameters. To force the backend to ignore the 3,218 lost units and order based on the current demand of ~580 units/period and an assumed lead time of 2 (target = 580 * 3 = 1740), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 4958 (Calculated as: [Actual Target 1740] + [Ghost Inventory 3218]). This ensures the backend sees a requirement that offsets the 'ghost' units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total increased to 3,218 units (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149, P32: 1329, P34: 865). Current demand regime (P38-P40) is stable at ~576 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 576 units (last 3 periods). The critical issue is 'ghost inventory'. Total in-transit is 4,461, but historical tracking confirms 3,218 units are likely lost (P3: 531, P14: 344, P24: 149, P32: 1,329, P34: 865). This leaves only 1,243 units of valid pipeline inventory (P35 arrived in P38, P38 arrived in P41; remaining valid are P39: 280 and P40: 963). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, I must use 'explicit' parameters to override the pipeline logic. I will set mu_hat based on the current 576-unit demand regime for (L+1)=3 periods, plus an 'explicit' L to account for recent 3-period lead times. I will set mu_hat to approximately 1,728 (576 * 3) plus an adjustment for the lost units to ensure the backend actually places an order if needed, but since the valid pipeline (1,243) + on-hand (75) = 1,318 is slightly below the 3-period demand (1,728), an order is required. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the 'ghost' inventory doesn't block replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total remains 3,218 units (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34). Current demand regime (P38-P41) is stable at ~569 units/period. Recent observed lead times (P35, P38) have shifted to 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). We observed a massive demand spike in Period 42 (3,100 units), which is likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'. This spike follows a stable regime of ~570 units. 

Lead Time Analysis: Recent arrivals (P38, P41, P42) all show an actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 to reflect this reality.

Ghost Inventory/Lost Shipments: The 'In-transit' figure is 5,227, but a large portion is confirmed lost (ghost inventory). Specifically: P3 (531), P14 (344), P24 (149), P32 (1329), and P34 (865) have not arrived. Total ghost inventory = 3,218 units. 

Parameter Strategy: To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the recent demand spike and ignore the 3,218 'ghost' units, I must use the 'explicit' method. 
1. mu_hat: The backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since it subtracts pipeline inventory (5,227), I need to add back the ghost units to the forecast. Baseline demand (pre-spike) ~570. P42 spike was 3100. Average of last 3 periods (P40-P42) is (581+547+3100)/3 = 1409. Using L=3, the mu_hat (covering 1+3=4 periods) should be 1409 * 4 = 5636. To account for ghost inventory (3218), I set mu_hat = 5636 + 3218 = 8854.
2. sigma_hat: Demand volatility is extremely high due to the spike. I will use 'explicit' to ensure a high service level, setting it to approximately 1.5x the baseline demand to cover the spike trailing off.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed in P42 (3,100 units) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by P38, P41, P42 arrivals). Total ghost inventory from lost shipments is 3,218 units (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim) following the massive Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike in Period 42 (3,100 units). Demand has since returned to a more normalized but elevated level in Period 43 (674 units). My lead time analysis confirms that actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (verified by the last four arrivals: P38, P39, P40, all arriving in 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the post-spike demand level (~674 units/period) while ignoring the extreme outlier of Period 42, which would otherwise over-inflate the order. The total 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34) is 3,218 units; because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to increase the base stock and neutralize the impact of these undeliverable units. By setting a very high sigma_hat, I ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost inventory threshold, allowing the backend to place necessary replenishment orders for the upcoming December/Holiday period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43) stabilized at 674 units. Actual lead time is consistently 3 periods. Total ghost inventory from lost shipments is 3,218 units (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-337.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (mid-December), we observe demand stabilizing at 680 units following the Black Friday spike (P42). The Period 43 order of 3,448 units arrived in just 1 period (observed in P44 conclude), but recent history (P38-P42) suggests lead times are more consistently 3 periods. I will use L=3 to remain conservative given the high 'ghost inventory'. Total ghost inventory is 3,218 units (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34), which are still counted in the OR backend's pipeline; I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger orders despite this 3,218-unit inflation. Using mu_hat with N=3 captures the post-Black Friday average (~677 units) which, when multiplied by (1+L), helps counteract the ghost inventory. sigma_hat with N=6 captures the high volatility from the Black Friday event to ensure a sufficient safety stock for the end-of-year holiday period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 677 units/period compared to the pre-spike November regime of ~570. Total ghost inventory from confirmed lost shipments remains 3,218 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The post-Black Friday demand (Periods 43-45) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 670 units per period (674, 680, 657). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this specific post-spike level. Lead times have been variable but clustered around 3 periods recently (P40, P42 arrived in 3; P43 arrived in 1). I will use L=3 to be safe given the holiday season logistics. On-hand inventory is currently high (3,446) due to the large P43 arrival, and there are 1,548 units in transit from P44 (expected in P47). Note that the total 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34) is 3,218 units. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units (including ghosts) from the base stock, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively neutralize these 3,218 units. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. With L=3, demand=670, base stock should be ~2680 + safety. Since current 'Pipeline' (ghosts 3218 + P44 1548 = 4766) and On-hand (3446) total 8212, and the OR engine will see 8212 units as 'available', I must set mu_hat high enough to prevent it from under-ordering in future cycles, though no order is likely needed this immediate period due to high stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) confirmed stable at ~670 units/period. Ghost inventory from lost shipments remains 3,218 units (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). The most recent demand (P46: 475) confirms the expected post-holiday drop in late December. The demand regime following the Black Friday spike (P43-P46) has a mean of approximately 622 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this post-spike stability while allowing for the natural year-end slowdown. Lead times have been volatile but frequently settle at 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this reality and ensure the base stock covers the longer replenishment cycle. Regarding 'ghost inventory': Total lost shipments amount to 3,218 units (P3, P14, P24, P32, P34). Because the backend subtracts 'in-transit' (4,766 units) from the base stock, and 3,218 of those units will never arrive, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places an order. Target base stock for L=3 is (1+L)*mu. With mu approx 622, base_stock should be ~2488 + safety stock. However, since the system thinks we have 4,766 in transit plus 2,971 on hand, it will not order unless I use an 'explicit' mu_hat that accounts for the 3,218 lost units. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that offsets the ghost inventory to maintain availability as we enter January.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (late Dec) confirmed a drop to 475 units. Ghost inventory remains at 3,218 units. Actual lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.
