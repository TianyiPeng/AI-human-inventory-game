Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS). No historical arrivals yet, so the promised lead time of 0 is our best estimate. Historical demand for the last 5 periods [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows an average of approximately 688.8 units. The demand seems relatively stable with a slight upward trend. Given it is February 11th, we are just past the Lunar New Year but in a transition towards spring/summer fashion. Denim trousers are typically a stable category. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent demand behavior while ignoring older, potentially irrelevant data. Since Lead Time = 0, the backend will treat the demand across the review+lead period as (1+0) * mean.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'High-waisted skinny denim trousers'. Historical demand for the last 5 periods was [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], and Period 1 demand was 671. The average demand across these 6 points is approximately 685.8. The promised lead time is 0, which was confirmed in Period 1 (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). Therefore L should stay as default (0). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8. I will use the last 5 samples to estimate mean and volatility to capture the recent stable demand range while acknowledging the slight variance seen in the history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers, a core fashion item. Current date is late February (Period 3). Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game periods was [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] (mean ~689). In Period 1 and 2, demand was 671 and 673 respectively, showing high stability and consistency with recent history. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time for Periods 1 and 2 has been confirmed as 0. Since the demand is very stable and we are in a regular season for denim, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent behavior while maintaining lead time at the promised 0. This ensures we carry enough stock for the current period's high volume without excessive holding costs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a core item (high-waisted denim). Historical demands [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] plus recent game history [671, 673, 539] show relative stability, though Period 3 saw a dip. The promised lead time is 0, and all periods (1, 2, and 3) have confirmed an actual lead time of 0. For Period 4, on-hand inventory is 201 units. I will use the recent N=3 average (627.6) for mu_hat to account for the recent slight decline in demand, and recent N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while maintaining the lead time at the confirmed 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1542.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple item in the Divided Collection. Analysis of the first 4 periods shows a clear downward demand trend: from highs of 671 and 673 in mid-February to 539 and 447 as we enter March. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 4. With on-hand inventory at 246 and the most recent demand at 447, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. Given the recent demand drop (average of last two periods is ~493 compared to the initial ~672), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling demand regime while still maintaining enough safety stock to cover the expected demand of roughly 500-600 units until the next decision cycle.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers, a core denim item. Since Period 1, we have observed a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Historical demand shows a downward trend from the initial weeks (avg ~672 in P1-P2 down to ~485 in P3-P5). This decline aligns with the transition from the mid-February peak towards mid-March. I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat behaviors to capture the current lower demand level (~485 units) while maintaining sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to account for the overall volatility observed during the transition. The backend will calculate base stock using a target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand decreased from ~670 (P1-P2) to ~485 (P3-P5), a decrease of approx 28%. Lead time confirmed as 0 periods across all 5 completed periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) has experienced a demand shift. Initial demand (P1-P2) averaged ~672 units, while the recent 4 periods (P3-P6) show a lower average demand of 489 units (539, 447, 468, 502). The most recent period (P6) had 502 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the recent demand regime by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower volume accurately while maintaining sufficient stock for the slight upward trend seen in the last two periods. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on a profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1), targeting an 80% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand for P3-P6 is ~489, compared to P1-P2 avg of ~672 (-27%). Lead time consistently 0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) shows a clear demand regime shift that occurred around Period 3. Initial demand (Periods 1-2) averaged ~672 units, while the subsequent five periods (Periods 3-7) have stabilized around a lower average of ~493 units ([539, 447, 468, 502, 511]). Current Date is April 1st; while there isn't a specific seasonal peak expected in this SKU category for early April, the most recent four periods show a slight upward trend in demand (447 -> 468 -> 502 -> 511). Historical lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To manage the current regime accurately, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the early high-demand outliers and focus on the current market state (~493 units/period). This ensures the base stock target reflects current velocity while maintaining a buffer for the recent slight upward trend.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Historical demand shows a regime shift after P2. P1-P2 average was ~672. P3-P8 demand has been [539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560], with an upward trend starting from P4 (447 to 560). In P8, we stocked out (demand 560, sold 524, ending inventory 0), indicating that recent demand is outstripping previous estimates (P8 demand of 560 is significantly higher than the P3-P7 average of 493). The lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize recent data to capture this rising trend. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (avg ~498) and sigma_hat, although I will set an explicit mu_hat slightly higher to 540 to account for the clear upward trend and prevents stockouts as we enter the spring season (April).

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upwards since P4 (447 to 560 across 5 periods), suggesting a seasonal rise as we enter April. Stockout occurred in P8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand shows a dip in early March followed by a recovery trend through late March and early April, coinciding with Spring season shopping. Demand dropped sharply in Period 9 (335 units) after a stockout in Period 8 (560 units demanded), which often happens in retail data due to 'demand censoring' or timing of replenishment. However, the overall trend from Period 4 (447) to Period 8 (560) was upward. Given Period 9 was an outlier on the low side and we are now in mid-April (2019/4/15), I expect demand to revert toward the recent mean of the recovery phase. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the demand environment including the recovery trend and the recent dip, providing a balanced forecast for the OR backend while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand remains volatile in April; Period 9 saw a significant drop (335) following a Period 8 stockout (560), breaking the previous 5-period uptrend.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we see that demand has dropped significantly over the last two periods (335 in P9, 269 in P10) following the April 1st peak. This suggests the previous upward trend was a short-term spike rather than a sustained seasonal shift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 267 units. To avoid overstocking while demand is cooling off, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime (avg ~388, heavily weighted by the drop). This allows the OR backend to adjust its base stock levels downward quickly to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level consistent with a 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Period 9-10 average demand is 302, a 46% decrease from the P8 peak (560). Previous upward trend has reversed.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization following a significant downward shift in early April. Demand for P9-P11 was 335, 269, and 261 respectively, showing a settling of the market after a volatile period. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift downward. I will use the last 3 periods (P9-P11) to capture this new, lower demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory (256) is roughly equal to one period of recent average demand (~288), making a replenishment order likely through the OR backend using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower regime: average demand for P10-P11 is 265 units, compared to the P1-P8 average of 540 units (-51%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of high-waisted skinny denim trousers. Current date is early May (2019/5/6). Historically, we saw a peak in demand during early April (P8: 560), followed by a sharp decline in mid-to-late April (P10: 269, P11: 261). However, Period 12 showed a bounce back to 339 units, causing a stockout as the system significantly under-ordered (only 67 units ordered due to high ending inventory in P11). This suggests the 'lower regime' identified in previous periods may be slightly too pessimistic for May. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent demand stabilization and slight uptick while protecting against the volatility seen in April, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 (P10-P12). This period's mu_hat will be based on the average of (269, 261, 339), which is ~290. This balances the lower late-April arrivals with the early May increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from late-April lows: Period 12 demand (339) is 30% higher than the P10-P11 average (265), ending the previous downward trend and causing a stockout.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-waisted denim trouser (Divided Collection), which is a core fashion item. Analysis of the demand history reveals significant volatility. Following a downward trend in late April, Period 12 saw a spike (339 units) causing a stockout, followed by a lower turnout in Period 13 (241 units). The date (2019/5/13) indicates we are in mid-May. Historically, demand for this item fluctuated between ~240 and ~340 units in the most recent 4 periods (P10-P13). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this current volatility level (average ~277.5). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. These parameters allow the backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer for the observed variance to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a definitive downward trend in May. After a brief rebound in P12 (339), demand has dropped sequentially to 241 (P13) and now 189 (P14). This aligns with the end of the spring retail season for this fashion item. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 3 periods (P12-P14) to capture this decelerating demand (mean ~256) and avoid overstocking as we enter late May. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR engine to react to this recent significant drop-off from the earlier spring highs while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward in May: average demand decreased from 283 (P11-P13) to 189 in P14, reflecting a cooling of mid-spring demand for denim.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 27, 2019 (Period 16). Period 15 saw a demand rebound to 375, which is significantly higher than the P13-14 average (approx 215) and resulted in a stockout. This indicates the 'downward regime shift' noted in Period 15 was likely a temporary dip or that we are entering a new higher demand phase for late May/early June. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the increased volatility and recent demand spike, I am using EWMA for mu_hat with a gamma of 0.6 to weigh recent periods more heavily without overreacting solely to the stockout period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased variance seen in the last several periods (189 to 375).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound in late May: Period 15 demand (375) reversed the P14 dip (189), suggesting increased late-spring volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a significant demand spike to 533 units, following a period 15 spike of 375. This marks a sharp reversal from the May lows (avg ~215 in P13-P14) and has resulted in back-to-back stockouts (sold < demand in P15 and P16). The date is June 3rd, indicating that summer demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is accelerating significantly. The previous 'recent_N' approach failed to capture this sudden surge because of the earlier low-demand periods. I am shifting to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent demand of 533, and increasing sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility seen in the last three periods (189, 375, 533). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge in June: Demand has increased from 189 (P14) to 375 (P15) to 533 (P16), indicating a strong summer seasonal trend and causing consecutive stockouts.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (706016001) is currently experiencing high demand volatility as we enter June. Period 16 saw a significant peak (533), leading to a stockout, while Period 17 saw a slight cooling to 451. The demand regime from Periods 15-17 (avg 453) is significantly higher than the May average (approx 190-240). Given the product type (high-waisted denim), a summer plateau is expected. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the slight dip in P17, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P15-P17) to capture this higher summer regime. Sigma_hat will also use the last 3 periods to account for the high volatility observed recently (range 375 to 533).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand plateau confirmed for June: Average demand for P15-P17 is 453 units, representing a sustained +100% increase over the early May regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand regime for Jade HW Skinny Denim (SKU 706016001). Historical data from June (Periods 16-18) shows demand levels of 533, 451, and 462, compared to the May dip. The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~482 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher demand while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the recent_3 average for mu_hat. This targets the most recent summer plateau (~480/period) rather than the long-term historical mean which includes the April/May slump. sigma_hat will also utilize recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Historical demand for June (P17-P19) shows levels of 451, 462, and 358 respectively. While Period 19 saw a slight cooling (358) from the early June peak (~450+), it remains significantly elevated compared to the May average (~260). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to anchor the forecast on this June summer plateau (avg ~423) while smoothing the recent weekly variance. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods. The OR backend with these parameters will maintain a higher base stock to prevent the stockouts seen earlier in the summer transition (P15-P16) while the high service level target (q=0.8) naturally handles the risk of stockouts during this high-demand period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in Period 21 (July 1st). Reviewing the historical demand for June (P17-P20: 451, 462, 358, 265), we observe a cooling trend as the summer peak in early June recedes. The average demand for the last 4 periods is 384 units, but the most recent two periods (P19-P20) averaged 311 units, indicating a return to a more moderate demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 207. Given the downward trend from the June peak, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current cooling trend while maintaining enough stock for potential residual summer demand. This balance addresses the Profit ($4) vs Holding Cost ($1) ratio (80% target service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed post-June peak: Average demand decreased from 456 (P17-P18) to 311 (P19-P20), a 32% decline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) is exhibiting a post-peak cooling phase after a strong June performance. Demand in July (P21: 353) remains significantly lower than the June peak (avg 453) but higher than the late April/early May lows. The most recent three periods (P19-P21) show demands of 358, 265, and 353, averaging 325 units. This suggests a relatively stable 'post-summer peak' regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand profile while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P15-P16. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which simplifies the inventory coverage to (L+1)=1 period.

Carry-over insight: Post-June demand stabilization: Average demand for P19-P21 is 325 units, representing a 28% decrease from the June peak (avg 453).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is a seasonal fashion item currently experiencing mid-summer demand volatility. In Period 22 (July 8), demand spiked to 393 units, causing a stockout from a starting inventory of 370 units. This follows a cooling period in late June. Over the last three cycles (P20-P22), demand has averaged 337 units, which is higher than the P19-P21 average of 325 units, indicating a potential mid-July resurgence. As lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by arrive=ordered in same periods), the OR backend needs to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means 1+L=1). To account for the recent volatility and the latest stockout, I am using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend shift from late June into July (Avg P19-P22 = 342). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility and ensure the safety stock is responsive to these mid-season fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand resurgence: Period 22 demand (393) ended the post-June decline, causing a stockout. Demand volatility remains high in the summer season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Data for Period 23 (July 15) shows a demand of 369, following a stockout in Period 22 (demand 393). The average demand for the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 347.6, which aligns with the 'post-June stabilization' identified in carry-over insights. The product (skinny denim trousers) is currently in the mid-summer season, where demand appears to be fluctuating between 260 and 400. To stabilize inventory against this volatility and prevent further stockouts, I will use a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) focused on the current summer regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set N=7 to capture the demand shift starting from mid-June (P17 onwards) to the present.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is currently in a high-volatility summer phase. Historically, late July/early August demand fluctuates between 232 and 393. Period 24 saw a significant drop to 232 from Period 23's 369, suggesting the mid-July resurgence may be cooling as we approach August. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts seen in Period 22 with the potential for further demand cooling (as seen in Period 24), I am using a recent_N window for both mean and volatility. I'll use N=5 (covering Periods 20-24: 265, 353, 393, 369, 232) to capture the current summer regime's average (approx 322) and its associated high variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the recent peak and the most recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Late-July demand drop: Period 24 demand (232) is 41% lower than the P21-P23 average (372), indicating another volatile shift or the start of a late-summer cooling trend.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in Period 26 (August 5th). Historical demand analysis shows significant volatility associated with seasonal shifts. The most recent demand (P25: 298) is a slight rebound from a sharp drop in P24 (232), following a mid-July peak. Over the last five periods (P21-P25), the average demand is approximately 329 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to utilize. Given the transition into August, which often signals a shift from summer peaks toward late-summer/pre-fall demand for denim, I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this post-peak stabilization. This choice balances the need to maintain enough stock for potential volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand continues to cool from the June/July highs. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84), which the OR engine will apply to my provided parameters.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Average demand for Period 21-25 is 329 units, a 27% decrease from the June peak (avg 453) but remains higher than the May lows (~240s).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is entering mid-August. Historically, demand for denim often sees a 'Back-to-School' uptick during this transition from late summer to early autumn. Recent demand has been volatile but shows a slight upward trend from the Period 24 low (232), moving to 298 and most recently 381 in Period 26, which caused an inventory draw-down to just 3 units. To capture this potential seasonal rise and prevent a stockout, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg 337) to capture the accelerating trend over the absolute 5-period average (314). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increasing volatility seen in the last three weeks. Lead time remains rock-solid at 0 periods based on the entire history.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand uptick suspected: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (232 -> 298 -> 381) as August progresses, reversing the late-July cooling trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1468.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (232 -> 298 -> 381 -> 493) confirms a strong 'back-to-school' surge as August progresses. The stockout in Period 27 (493 demand vs 367 supply) signals that previous estimates were too low. Since we are in the middle of this seasonal uptick, I will base the demand forecast on the last 4 periods (N=4), which captures the transition from the late-July low to the current August peak. This results in a mu_hat reflecting a mean of ~351 units per period. I will also use a recent window for sigma_hat (N=4) to account for the increased volatility associated with this surge. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (232 to 493), representing a 112% increase from the late-July low and resulting in a Period 27 stockout.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has surged significantly in August, confirming a 'Back-to-School' seasonal peak. Following a stockout in Period 27 (demand 493), Period 28 saw continued high demand (432). The current date is late August (Aug 26), which typically aligns with the height of the back-to-school shopping season for hardware skinny denim. Demand has shifted from a late-July low of 232 to an August average of 435 units (+87% increase). To capture this higher regime and maintain high service levels during this critical period, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P25-P28), which encompasses the current surge. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: August Back-to-School demand peak confirmed: average demand for Period 25-28 is 401 units compared to late-July (P24) demand of 232 (+72% increase). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 30 (2019/09/02). Historical analysis shows a strong 'Back-to-School' surge in August (P26-P28 demand: 381, 493, 432), which appears to have peaked and is now slightly softening (P29 demand: 396). September typically sees a stabilization or gradual cooling after the initial school rush. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent high-volume but currently stabilizing trend, I am using a recent_N window for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) of N=4, covering the peak August performance. This ensures we carry enough safety stock for the end of the season while acknowledging the slight downward turn in the latest period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high demand history with the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-School transition: Demand peaked at 493 (P27) and has begun a slight deceleration to 396 (P29) as September begins.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (September 2nd), demand spiked dramatically to 740 units, a 87% increase over the Period 29 demand of 396 and significantly higher than the previous Back-to-School peaks. This surge resulted in a complete stockout. This timing aligns with the standard peak for Fall fashion/Back-to-School shopping often seen in early September. Because of this extreme volatility and the stockout, I must adjust mu_hat upward to prevent further lost sales, despite the previous trend suggesting a deceleration. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (promised matches actual). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand August/September window while acknowledging the most recent outlier, and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Late-September demand surge. Demand increased from 396 (P29) to 740 (P30), an 87% jump, resulting in a stockout and suggesting a second, stronger wave of Back-to-School or Fall seasonal demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2560.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand remained extremely high at 708 units, following a peak of 740 in Period 30. This confirms a significant late-September surge, likely a major Fall fashion launch or a secondary Back-to-School wave, which has caused two consecutive stockouts. The demand has shifted from an August average of ~430 to a September average of ~724 (+68%). With the lead time confirmed at 0 periods, I need to set mu_hat to capture this new elevated regime while accounting for high volatility (sigma_hat). I will use recent_N=2 to emphasize the most recent two-period spike (740 and 708) to ensure the system orders enough to prevent a third consecutive stockout. The base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) needs to be aggressive here given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) and current zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Late-September demand surge: Demand for P30-P31 averaged 724 units, a 68% increase over the August average (~430). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a sustained high-demand phase associated with the late-September/Fall seasonal surge. Demand for the last three periods has been 740, 708, and 707 (average ~718), which is a significant increase over the August average of ~430. This suggests a plateau at a high level rather than a single-period spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this specific high-volume regime while filtering out the lower demand from August. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current velocity for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P30-P32 has stabilized at ~718 units, a 67% increase over the August Back-to-School average (~430).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 saw a massive demand spike to 1,428 units, which is a 100% increase over the already high 'Fall seasonal' regime (~718 units). This likely corresponds to a specific end-of-September or transition-to-October peak (e.g., payday weekend, climate shift, or a mid-season promotion). Given the product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', high-waisted skinny jeans are a staple for fall/winter layering. A stockout occurred in P33. To address this extreme volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the shift from the August baseline to this new September peak (P30-P33 avg demand: 895). I am choosing 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the massive variance seen in the last period (707 to 1428) which 'recent_N' might under-penalize given the single outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sudden extreme demand surge in late September: Period 33 demand reached 1,428 units, a 100% increase over the previous three-week average of 718, resulting in a severe stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has entered a significantly higher fall seasonal regime, peaking at 1,428 units in P33 before retracting to 748 in P34. For Period 35 (early October), we observe that while the P33 surge was likely an anomaly or a specific event spike, the general demand floor has moved from ~400 (August) to ~725 (late September average excluding the spike). The P34 demand of 748 confirms this new baseline. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this fall regime (P30-P34 average is 866), ensuring we have sufficient stock to cover the volatility seen in P33 without over-ordering based on that single extreme outlier. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal demand surge confirmed: Demand baseline has shifted from ~430 (August) to ~725 (September baseline) with a significant volatility spike in Period 33 (1,428 units).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) has shifted into a Fall/Winter seasonal regime. Following the extreme demand spike in P33 (1,428 units), demand has stabilized over the last two periods (P34-35) at an average of 677. This aligns with the 'Fall seasonal demand' baseline of ~725 identified in Period 35's carry-over. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility observed in September/October (std dev ~270 over the last 6 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime while moving past the August baseline. This helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to prevent stockouts while acknowledging the stabilization after the P33 peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter stabilization: Demand has averaged 677 units over P34-P35, confirming a shift away from the extreme P33 outlier while remaining ~55% higher than the August baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized in October after the extreme volatility seen in late September (Period 33 outlier of 1428 units). Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has settled into a consistent range: 748, 606, and 581 units, averaging 645 units. This represents a confirmed shift into a high-demand fall/winter regime compared to the August baseline, though significantly lower than the P33 spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized fall demand while filtering out the September extreme, I am using a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we carry enough stock for the current 600-700 unit demand level while providing a buffer against the observed high volatility of the summer-to-fall transition.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand stabilized post-September spike: Average demand for P34-P36 is 645 units, establishing a new baseline for October/November.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has stabilized in October following the extreme volatility of September. Period 37 demand was 643 units, which aligns closely with the P34-P36 average of 645 units identified in previous insights. The current date is October 28, moving into a stable mid-fall period before potential holiday shifts. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (P34-P37), as it filters out the P33 outlier while reflecting current demand levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. This approach ensures a high service level for the stable baseline without over-adjusting for past extreme spikes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Fall demand plateau confirmed: Period 34-37 demand has averaged 644 units, demonstrating high stability after the volatile September transition. Profit-to-Holding ratio (4:1) supports a base stock targeting an 80% service level.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized into a mid-fall plateau. Since the extreme outlier in Period 33 (1,428 units), the subsequent five periods (P34-P38) show a remarkably stable mean of 648.2 units with relatively low variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 64). The date is 2019/11/04, indicating we are moving towards the late fall/pre-holiday season. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, which is well-served by this stable baseline. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized fall regime while discarding the extreme volatility of late September. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (Nov) perfectly stabilized: P34-P38 mean is 648 units (Std Dev 64), confirming a predictable plateau after the September volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' in Period 39 was 485 units, which is a decline from the stable plateau of ~648 units observed from Periods 34-38. Given the date is November 11th, this could be a pre-holiday lull or a signal of a downward regime shift as we move deeper into Q4. However, the drop is only one data point. To maintain a balanced service level and avoid overreacting to a single period's fluctuation while acknowledging the recent stability, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (covering P34-P39) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This includes the high-volume period (September/October baseline) and the most recent softening. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, which I will continue to use. With a profit-to-holding ratio of 4:1 (target service level ~80%), this approach provides sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs if the downtrend continues.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/11/11 (Period 40) was 581 units, which is slightly below the previous Mid-Fall plateau average of ~645 units but significantly higher than the previous period's demand (485). The current demand regime (P34-P40) shows a stable average of 630 units with a standard deviation of 85 units. Given the date is now November 18th and the product is skinny denim trousers, we are entering the pre-holiday shopping season. While the baseline has been stable, we should maintain a robust stock level to prepare for potential late-November demand spikes associated with Black Friday / Cyber Monday. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8 (target 80th percentile), which warrants a safety factor. I will use the recent regime (last 7 periods) for demand and volatility estimates to capture the stabilization after the September volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-waisted denim skinny jeans (706016001) has remained stable throughout November. For the period P34-P41 (the post-September-surge regime), the average demand is 633 units. The most recent three periods (P39-P41) show a slight cooling with demands of 485, 581, and 547 (mean = 538), which is common as the peak fall transition settles into a late-November/early-December baseline. Given the 4:1 Profit-to-Holding ratio, the target service level is 80%. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 (covering P34-P41) to capture the current fall regime's mean and volatility while softening the impact of the extreme P33 outlier. This provides a stable base_stock calculation for the OR backend to handle the current inventory level of 138 units.

Carry-over insight: Mid-to-late November demand regime stabilized: Period 34-41 average demand is 633 units, showing high consistency as the season matures.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed massive holiday demand of 3,100 units (Date: 2019/11/25), likely corresponding to Cyber Monday or Black Friday-related peak shopping activity for high-waisted jeans. This caused a total stockout. Prior to this, demand had stabilized in November at ~633 units. While the 3,100 figure is likely an extreme seasonal outlier, the upcoming periods in December are expected to sustain higher-than-average baseline demand before cooling for the post-holiday season. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat (P34-P42) would produce a mean of ~857 units, which effectively captures the shift to a higher baseline while mitigating the extreme distortion of the 3,100 spike (excluding it yields ~630). However, given the significant stockout, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast of 900 to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle potential December volatility without overstocking if demand returns to the 650-range. Sigma_hat is set to 300 (explicit) to account for the high volatility seen in the transition from November to December.

Carry-over insight: Significant holiday seasonal spike observed on Period 42 (Nov 25): Demand reached 3,100 units, a 490% increase over the previous 8-week average (633), resulting in a complete stockout.

In P43, demand returned to 674 units, which aligns closely with the established pre-spike baseline of ~640 units (P34-P41 avg: 633). Historically, after major promotional or seasonal events, demand often returns to its baseline or dips slightly before stabilizing for the next holiday wave (e.g., late December). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the P42 outlier while ensuring sufficient stock for the December holiday season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the stable autumn baseline plus the start of the holiday volatility. This provides a balanced base stock that targets the ~80% service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonal spike confirmed: Period 42 demand (3,100 units) represents a nearly 5x increase over the 8-week baseline, likely due to Black Friday. Period 43 demand (674) indicates a return to the pre-spike baseline (~630-650 units).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December period (Period 45), following the major seasonal spike in late November (Black Friday). Period 42 saw demand of 3,100 units, while Periods 43 and 44 have stabilized at demand of 674 and 680 respectively, confirming a return to the pre-spike baseline of approximately 640-650 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the extreme outlier in P42 is non-representative of the current stabilized demand but necessary for calculating variance, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the post-holiday stability while acknowledging the slightly elevated winter baseline compared to early fall. I'll set N=11 for mu_hat to cover the stable regime from P34 onwards (excluding the P42 outlier in mean calculation via backend logic, or smoothing it) and N=11 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in late Q4. This ensures the OR backend targets a sufficient service level for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday stabilization confirmed: Demand in P43-P44 (avg 677) has returned to the pre-Black Friday baseline observed in Oct/Nov (~640), indicating the end of the primary seasonal spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has successfully stabilized following the extreme Black Friday spike (3,100 units in P42). Post-spike demand (P43-P45) has returned to the established late-autumn baseline, with an average of 670 units (674, 680, 657). The current date is December 23rd, 2019. Historical patterns and the product type (High-waisted skinny denim) suggest that demand should remain relatively steady or slightly decline as the holiday peak passes and before any potential New Year/Spring retail refresh. The profit-to-holding cost ratio is 4:1 ($4.0/$1.0), which mathematically targets a service level of 80% (\u03a6\u22121(0.8) \u2248 0.84). With lead time consistently at 0 periods, my current inventory management focus is to maintain stock levels aligned with the 670-unit baseline. A recent_N of 3 for mu_hat accurately captures the current immediate post-spike regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. The high-waisted jeans have transitioned out of the peak holiday season (Black Friday spike in P42). Post-holiday demand (P43-P45) returned to the stable autumn/winter baseline of approximately 640-670 units, but Period 46 shows a seasonal dip to 475 units, consistent with the naturally cooling interest in new denim purchases during the final week of December. Historically, lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 0 periods. For the upcoming period (early January), I expect demand to either remain at this slightly lower year-end level or begin a mild recovery toward the standard baseline. Given the Profit ($4) to Holding Cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets a service level of 80% (q=0.8). Operating on the detected post-peak regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4: P43-P46) to capture the current post-holiday mean (~621 units) while providing sufficient safety stock through the recent_N sigma_hat to account for end-of-year volatility. Period 46's zero-order was likely an automated correction for high inventory; I will maintain current parameters to ensure availability as we enter January.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling: Demand dropped to 475 in P46 (Dec 23), indicating a seasonal deceleration following the post-Black Friday stabilization baseline (~650).
