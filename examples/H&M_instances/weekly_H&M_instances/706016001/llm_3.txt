  "rationale": "Step 1: Product & Calendar Analysis. SKU 706016001 is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (High-waisted skinny jeans). This is a staple 'Divided Collection' item for H&M/fast-fashion, likely having consistent year-round demand with slight peaks during school/work transitions. The date is Feb 11, 2019 (mid-February), typically a stable period post-winter clearance and leading into spring. Step 2: Demand Analysis. Historical samples [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] show a mean demand of approximately 689 units per period. Step 3: Lead Time & Inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. Step 4: Order Logic. To prevent stockouts, I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand (Periods 1, 2, and 3) because an order placed now (P1) will arrive in P3's arrival phase (making it available for P4's demand, per the execution sequence). However, demand for P1 and P2 occurs BEFORE the P1 order arrives. Since I start with 0 stock, P1 and P2 will inevitably have lost sales. I must order enough now to satisfy the pipeline once arrivals begin. Forecasted demand for 3 periods (L+1) is ~689 * 3 = 2067 units. To be safe given the high historical variance, I will target approximately 2100 units to establish the initial pipeline.",

Total demand to cover until the next possible arrival (from a P2 order) is P2, P3, and P4 (since lead time is 2). Estimated demand per period is ~700. Required coverage for 3 periods = 2100 units. e) Order Logic: We have 2100 in transit which covers exactly 3 periods of expected demand (700 * 3). However, we currently have a stockout (0 on-hand) and lost 671 sales in P1.

Observed demands in P1 (671) and P2 (673) are very consistent with this mean.
