Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is an HM 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny jean. The date is Feb 11, 2019. Historically, the last 5 periods (presumably leading up to this point) show a demand mean of 688.8 units (std ~72). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to order enough to cover demand from Period 1 to Period 5 (L+1 periods). On-hand and in-transit are currently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent average, and 'default' for lead time as we have no evidence yet of lead-time drift. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the review period plus lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple apparel item. Demand history shows [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] prior to Period 1, and Period 1 demand was 671. The mean demand across these 6 samples is 685.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and an order of 808 placed in Period 1 (in-transit), we must continue to build inventory towards a base stock that covers (L+1) periods. L is 4, so we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all 6 available samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations is appropriate as there is no clear regime shift yet. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the deficit between the calculated base stock and the 808 units already in-transit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny denim trouser. The observed demand history is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774, 671, 673], showing very stable demand with a mean around 684. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 808 units were ordered, and in Period 2, 793 units were ordered (total in-transit: 1601). No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the first order is not due until Period 5 (L=4). Demand in Periods 1 and 2 was missed because the initial on-hand inventory was zero. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 to capture all available data points and 'default' for lead time since we have no completed shipment cycles to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a high-waisted skinny denim item. Historical demand is [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] and recent observed demand is [671, 673, 539]. The average demand is approximately 665 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 2383 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Since we have not reached the promised lead time yet, no arrivals are expected or have been missed. I will use the 'default' lead time method. For mean demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the 5 historical plus 3 game periods) to account for the consistent demand around 660-670. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted denim trouser. Historically, demand over the last 5 periods has been [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. However, within the game context, observed demand for Periods 1-4 was 671, 673, 539, and 447 respectively. There is a downward trend in the recent 4 periods (mean ~582). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (808 units), 2 (793), 3 (782), and 4 (817). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is scheduled to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (1+4=5). Since we are currently at the start of Period 5's decision phase, it is normal that we haven't seen any 'arrived' messages yet (the first arrival info will appear in the Period 5 conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 3200 units in transit. Given the recent demand slowdown from ~680 to ~450 over 4 weeks, I will use a recent_N method (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering while awaiting the first shipments to clear out the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1532.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [671, 673, 539, 447, 468]. There is a noticeable downward trend or regime shift after Period 2, where demand dropped from the ~670 range to the ~480 range. Average demand overall is 559, but the last 3 periods average 484. The product is High-waisted denim jeans, which are staple items but can see shifts in seasonal interest. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). With 340 units on hand and 2392 units in transit (expected arrivals in P6, P7, P8, and P9), we are currently well-covered in the pipeline. I will set L to calculate to use observed lead time. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent lower demand levels (approx 484/period), which prevents over-ordering while on-hand is low and pipeline is high. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after Period 2: Demand decreased from ~670 to ~480 (approx -28% shift). Lead time confirmed at promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the product 706016001 (Skinny Denim) continues in a lower demand regime following a shift observed after Period 2. The average demand for the initial two periods was 672, while the average for the subsequent four periods (P3-P6) has dropped to 489. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 631 units, with 1,599 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and potentially P5 if any). Based on L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the lower post-shift average (~489/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline (1599) + on-hand (631) = 2230, which is roughly 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate; the OR backend will calculate the appropriate top-up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1142.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The product is a staple item (high-waisted skinny jeans). Historical demand shows a clear shift after Period 2: the mean demand for Periods 1-2 was 672, while the mean for Periods 3-7 settled at 493.4. Given the seasonal stability of basic denim and the transition into April, there is no immediate evidence of a further spike or drop. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory (1108) consists of orders from P4 (817) and P7 (291). With 902 on hand and 817 expected to arrive in Period 8's resolution phase, the total inventory position is healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 3-7). Lead time L will remain at 'default' since it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. The carry-over insight noted a significant demand regime shift after Period 2, where demand dropped from the ~670 range to an average of ~500. Recent demands (P3-P8) are [539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560], confirming a stable regime with a mean around 504. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current on-hand (1159) plus in-transit (817) equals 1976 units. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At ~510 units/period, target inventory is roughly 2550. My parameters will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the post-shift demand regime accurately, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to reach the base stock level while accounting for the lower mean.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a year-round basic. Historically, demand shifted at Period 3 from ~670 to ~480. Recent demands (P3-P9) are [539, 447, 468, 502, 511, 560, 335], averaging 480.2. The drop in Period 9 (335) might be a fluke or a post-Easter dip (Easter was April 21 in 2019, so P9 is the week before). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8 matching orders from P1, P2, P3, P4). Currently, On-hand (824) + Pipeline (1392) = 2216. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 480.2 = 2401. Since 2216 < 2401, the OR engine will likely place a small order. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime since Period 3.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis for Period 11 (2019/4/22) indicates a further decline in demand. The initial regime (P1-P2) averaged ~672. The second regime (P3-P8) averaged ~504. However, the last two recorded periods (P9-P10) show a sharp drop to 335 and 269 (avg 302), possibly due to post-Easter seasonality for denim or a shifting trend. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with early data (P1-P4 all arrived at L=4). Pipeline inventory (1719) is high relative to this new lower demand level. I will set L=4 (default) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the shift from the high initial demand while giving weight to the recent downward trend, ensuring the OR model doesn't over-order against the high in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand dropped from ~500 to ~300 (-40%) over the last two observations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a sustained downward demand trend. After an initial regime shift around Period 3 (averaging ~500), we've seen a further significant drop starting Period 9. The last three periods (P9-P11) have demand values of 335, 269, and 261, averaging approximately 288 units per period. This represents a ~42% decrease from the previous ~500 average. Lead times are stable at the promised 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Currently, 'On-hand' (585) and 'In-transit' (1616) total 2201 units, which is approximately 7.6 periods of coverage at the current demand rate of 288. Given lead time L=4, we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. My goal is to lower the base stock to prevent excessive holding costs while the backend manages the order cap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to maintain a conservative safety buffer during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 9: Average weekly demand stabilized at ~288 units, down from ~500 (-42%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has shifted significantly over the history. After an initial phase of ~670 and a second phase of ~500, we are now in Period 13 seeing a sustained lower regime since Period 9. The last four periods of demand are 335, 269, 261, and 339, which average approximately 301 units. This confirms the previously noted 'Carry-over Insight' of a regime shift to ~300. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P7, and P8). With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. On-hand (772) + In-transit (1090) = 1862 units. This inventory level already covers approximately 6.2 periods of the current demand (1862 / 301). Therefore, a conservative approach focusing on the most recent 4-period regime is appropriate to avoid overstocking and high holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to anchor the OR engine to the new demand levels.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (mid-May). Demand for these Jade HW Skinny Denim trousers has stabilized at a lower regime following a significant drop around Period 9. The last 5 demand observations are [335, 269, 261, 339, 241], averaging approximately 289 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 1106 units on hand and 515 in transit (from orders in Periods 10 and 11), our total pipeline is 1621 units. Given that (L+1) periods of current demand is roughly 5 * 289 = 1445 units, we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized lower demand and volatility, which will signal the OR backend to minimize orders until inventory levels adjust to the lower demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-488.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (superstretch denim trousers) has entered a significantly lower regime. After an initial drop around Period 3-4 from ~670 to ~500, a second more drastic decline occurred starting Period 9. The last five demand observations (P10-P14) are [269, 261, 339, 241, 189], resulting in an average demand of approximately 260 units. This decline aligns with the seasonal transition in late spring (May 20) for skinny high-waisted denim. The current inventory (On-hand: 1244, In-transit: 188) totals 1432 units, which is enough to cover over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (260 * 5 = 1300). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new demand mean, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent the system from over-ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Demand hit a new low of 189 units; the 5-period average (P10-P14) is now 260 units, suggesting a potential further tapering of the late-spring denim season.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is May 27th, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has shown a clear downward trend as we move further into the spring/summer season, likely due to a seasonal shift away from heavy denim. After an initial drop near Period 9, demand has fluctuated between ~190 and ~375. The most recent demand (375) was higher than the previous period (189), but the overall trend since Period 9 remains lower than the early spring peak. I am observing a demand regime of approximately 280 units/period (average of P9-P15 is ~287). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 1057 units and no in-transit quantities, the current stock is sufficient to cover approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the recent average. Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline target (L+1) is 5 periods of demand. However, the OR backend's base-stock formula will naturally order small amounts or nothing if the on-hand is high relative to the calculated base_stock. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-drop demand stabilize at the lower level, preventing over-ordering as the season likely winds down further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 9 at an average of ~287 units/period, down from previous averages. Period 15 showed a minor rebound to 375, but the 7-period trend remains significantly lower than early spring.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is exhibiting a secondary demand regime shift as we enter June. Demand in Period 15 (375) and Period 16 (533) has spiked significantly compared to the late-spring low average of ~260 (P10-P14). This likely reflects a seasonal trend or early-summer promotion. The 8-period average since the previous regime shift (P9-P16) is 318, but the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) average 365, with P16 specifically hitting 533. I will transition to recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward movement while remaining grounded in recent volatility. Current inventory (on-hand 524 + in-transit 395 = 919) is relatively low given the rising demand and the 4-period lead time. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P7 through P11.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Average demand increased from ~260 to ~454 (+74%) over the last two observations (P15-P16), reversing the late-spring decline and suggesting an early summer seasonal spike.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is experiencing a significant demand uptick as we enter June. Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 375, 533, and 451, averaging 453 units. This contrasts sharply with the P10-P14 low-season average of approximately 260 units. This surge is likely driven by early summer seasonality. We are currently in a transition phase; we placed orders in P16 and P17 (total 950 units in-transit) which are scheduled to arrive in P20 and P21 based on the stable lead time of 4 periods. With only 73 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~450+ per period, we will face stockouts in P18 and P19. To mitigate this and capture the potential continued summer peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock level to cover the (L+1) = 5 period outlook, despite the immediate stockout risk before the next arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer seasonal spike: Demand increased from a P10-P14 average of ~260 to a P15-P17 average of ~453 (+74%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (super-skinny denim) is exhibiting a clear seasonal demand spike since transitioning into June (P15 onwards). Demand has surged from a late-spring average of ~260 units (P10-P14) to a recent 4-period average of ~455 units (P15-P18). Because the 'on-hand' inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) and lost sales occurred in Period 18, we must set parameters that reflect this higher demand regime to ensure the inventory pipeline is replenished. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new summer demand level (average ~455/period) while ignoring the lower spring data. This choice targets a service level appropriate for high-demand periods to recover from the current stockout.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and high demand. A seasonal demand spike was identified at Period 15, with demand averaging approximately 436 units (P15-P19) compared to the previous late-spring average of ~260. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in P16, P17, P18, and P19 are in transit and expected to arrive in P20, P21, P22, and P23 respectively. Since the demand has shifted significantly upwards due to summer seasonality, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (P15-P19) to capture this higher mean (~436 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the 'default' promised 4 periods as observed lead times consistently match this value.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal spike sustained: Average demand from P15-P19 is ~436 units, a ~67% increase over the P10-P14 average of ~260 units. Stockout occurred P18-P19 due to late reaction to this surge; pipeline contains significant volume (2095 units) to recover starting P20.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained summer demand period for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. Demand spiked starting Period 15 (moving from an average of ~260 to ~436 units). However, the last two observations (P19: 358, P20: 265) show a potential cooling off from the mid-June peak. We experienced stockouts in P18 and P19, but a shipment of 395 units arrived in P20, and the pipeline is now very heavy with 1,918 units (orders from P17-P20) scheduled to arrive over the next four periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1,918 units plus the 130 on-hand units totals 2,048 units. Given that the summer regime average (P15-P20) is approximately 407 units, the pipeline already covers 5 periods of demand (407 * 5 = 2,035). Adding more stock now risks high holding costs as the summer peak likely transitions toward late-season tapering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current summer regime (P15-P20) and 'calculate' for L as lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization following the early summer seasonal spike. The demand in Period 20 (265 units) and Period 21 (353 units) suggests a slight cooling off or natural variance compared to the P15-P17 peak of ~453 units. The calculated average demand from P15 to P21 is approximately 400 units, which is a more sustainable estimate for the current regime than the previous peak. On-hand inventory is recovering (332 units), and the pipeline contains 1530 units (from orders in P18, P19, P20, and P21), with the larger P18 order (583 units) expected to arrive in Period 22's arrival phase. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P15-P21) to capture this summer regime (N=7). Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P15-P21) average stabilized at ~400 units, significantly higher than the spring low of ~260 but lower than the initial spike peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a sustained summer demand regime (July 2019). Demand since the high spike in Period 15 has averaged 391 units per period (P15-P22). Most recently, demand has stabilized between 350-400 units (P21-P22). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 522 units on hand and 1,250 in transit, the current pipeline is healthy and recovering from the stockouts in P18-P19. I will set L to calculate as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (since Period 15) to capture this higher summer demand level accurately without being skewed by the spring lows.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) has entered a stable summer demand regime after the initial June spike. Demand over the last 9 periods (P15-P23) has averaged approximately 398 units per period, with recent fluctuations between 350 and 400. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With 715 units on-hand and 1064 units in-transit (orders from P20-P23), the pipeline is healthy. For Period 24, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 periods (since P15) to capture the current summer demand level (~400 units/period) while ignoring the lower spring demand and higher early-season demand. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the 5-period risk window (L+1) while the stockout recovery is already arriving.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (skinny denim) has entered a post-peak summer phase where demand is stabilizing at a lower level compared to the initial June spike. Recent demand figures for Periods 22, 23, and 24 are 393, 369, and 232 respectively. The sharp drop in P24 (232 units) suggests the summer seasonal peak is tapering off as we move toward late July. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 701, and with an in-transit pipeline of 1190 units, there is sufficient inventory to cover the lead-time window. To avoid over-ordering during this downtrend, I am using a recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) with N=5 (P20-P24) to capture the recent cooling trend (averaging ~322 units/period), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the risk of excess stock as demand fades for the season.

Carry-over insight: Sustained deceleration of summer demand: Period 24 demand (232) is significantly lower than the P15-P23 average (~420), suggesting a seasonal shift towards late-summer/pre-autumn patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $622.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the high-waisted denim skinny jeans (706016001) is entering a late-summer/pre-autumn transition. After a summer peak where demand averaged ~400 units (P15-P23), the most recent two periods (P24-P25) have seen a significant drop to an average of 265 units (232 and 298 respectively). This matches the pattern observed in late spring (around Period 14) where demand bottomed out before a seasonal shift. Considering the date (August 5th), we are likely exiting the peak summer interest for this specific wash/style. On-hand inventory is 570 units, and the pipeline (1023 units) remains substantial. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 captures this deceleration (Average: ~299) while providing enough safety. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the volatility seen during the transition from the high-demand summer period to the current lower-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained deceleration confirmed: Demand has shifted from a summer average of ~400 to a late-summer average of ~265 over the last two periods (P24-P25), a decrease of ~34%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1032.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is currently in a transition phase. After a sustained summer peak where demand averaged ~400 units, the most recent three periods (P24-P26) have shown a mix of lower and moderate demand (232, 298, 381), resulting in an average of ~304 units. While Period 26 saw a rebound to 381, this is still below the mid-summer peak. We have confirmed the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position is: On-hand (492) + In-transit (747) = 1,239 units. Given the transition towards late August, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (average 304 x 5 = 1520) to reflect the deceleration from the summer peak while acknowledging the recent uptick. This prevents over-ordering if the late-summer cooling trend continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P24: Summer peak (avg ~400) decelerating to a late-summer average of ~304 units (approx -24%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' (706016001) has shown significant volatility in August. Period 27 demand spiked to 493 units, contradicting the 'late-summer deceleration' observed in Periods 24-25. This likely reflects a 'Back-to-School' surge, which typically starts in mid-to-late August for denim products. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we are now ordering for mid-September arrivals. Based on the last 4 periods (P24-P27), the average demand is ~351 units, but the most recent two periods (P26-P27) average ~437 units. I will prioritize the recent surge while acknowledging the previous deceleration by setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current volatility and the upward trend of the last two weeks. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased variance during this transitional period.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School volatility detected: Demand spiked from ~265 (P24-P25) to ~437 (P26-P27), an increase of ~65%, reversing the early August deceleration.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), we are observing a significant 'Back-to-School' seasonal demand spike for the Jade Skinny Denim TRS. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) has averaged 435 units, which is a 43% increase from the early August deceleration (P24-P25 avg: 265). This pattern mirrors the earlier summer spike and requires an immediate adjustment to the base stock level to prevent stockouts, especially as we enter the peak autumn fashion transition. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P24 order arrived P28). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. For mu_hat, I'm using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current 435-unit mean, and for sigma_hat, I'm using N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this surge. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1), which is appropriate given the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School demand surge confirmed (P26-P28): Demand stabilized at ~435 units (+43% over previous late-summer dip).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted Jeans) is currently in a sustained 'Back-to-School' surge. Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged approximately 426 units (381, 493, 432, 396), compared to the late-summer dip of ~265 units. Period 29 resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0, demand 396 vs 287 on-hand), indicating that current inventory levels are insufficient for this higher demand regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand at 0 and a significant demand surge, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean (~426) and volatility. This will increase the base stock level to capture the higher demand and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has entered a significant 'Back-to-School' surge, with Period 30 showing a massive spike to 740 units. This follows a high-demand period (P26-P28 avg ~435), but the scale of the P30 jump (likely the seasonal peak for jeans in early September) suggests a major regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in P29 and P30. The pipeline (1993 units) contains orders from P27-P30, which are expected to arrive in P31-P34 based on the stable 4-period lead time. To address the new volatility and high demand peak, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a local regime. I'll use recent_N with N=5 (covering P26-P30), which averages ~488 units per period, to capture the surge while moderating the single-point 740 outlier. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School peak confirmed: Period 30 demand spiked to 740 units, significantly exceeding the P26-P29 average of ~435 (+70% increase). Demand regime shifted from late-summer average to high-volatility school season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand Back-to-School/Autumn transition phase. Period 30 and 31 demand (740 and 708 units) confirms a significant regime shift compared to the earlier August average of ~435 units. The system is currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last three periods) because recent arrivals (27 units in P30, 420 units in P31) are insufficient to meet this 700+ unit demand. The pipeline inventory (2299 units) is being built up to address this, but we must maintain aggressive ordering parameters to reflect the new demand level. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the surge from P29-P31 (average ~614 units). This ensures the base stock target (covering 5 periods of demand) accounts for the current high-velocity environment while the OR backend's safety stock logic (sigma_hat) handles the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand Autumn regime confirmed (P30-P31): Demand stabilized at ~724 units, a 66% increase over the late-August average of ~435.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim TRS) is in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School regime. Demand has stabilized at a very high level, with the last three periods (P30-P32) averaging ~718 units (740, 708, 707), which is a significant increase (+65%) over the late-August average of ~435. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we are experiencing stockouts, I need to set parameters that encourage high ordering to meet this sustained demand surge. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat specifically targets this new high-demand regime (P30 onwards). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility seen in this peak season. Although the in-transit inventory is high (2690 units), this reflects the aggressive ordering from P29-P32 designed to catch up with the surge. Maintaining these parameters ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at ~718 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School high-demand regime confirmed: Demand stabilized between P30-P32 at an average of ~718 units/period, a ~65% increase from the P26-P29 average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a massive demand surge associated with the autumn/back-to-school season. Period 33 observed a massive demand spike to 1,428 units, which is double the previous regime average of ~718 units (P30-P32). While Period 33 might be an outlier peak, the overall regime since Period 30 is significantly higher than previous periods. The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a large pipeline of 2,912 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp increase in Period 33, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 high-demand weeks (P30-P33: 740, 708, 707, 1428 -> avg 895) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that can handle both the sustained high demand and the recent extreme volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture this increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand surged to 1,428 units, doubling the P30-P32 average of ~718. The autumn high-demand regime is now characterized by extreme volatility (avg ~895 units, P30-P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a high-demand autumn/back-to-school phase. Demand peaked at 1,428 units in P33 and remained high at 748 units in P34, bringing the recent average (P30-P34) to approximately 874 units per period. The system has suffered sequential stockouts (P29-P34) because arrival quantities (based on older, lower demand parameters) were insufficient to meet this surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0. However, the pipeline is now heavily loaded with 3,884 units (specifically the large orders placed in P31-P34). Given the promised lead time L=4 is stable, the orders from P31 (726 units), P32 (928 units), and P33 (750 units) are expected to arrive in P35, P36, and P37 respectively. To address the current regime shift, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high-volatility autumn mean (~874), and sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the high variance observed (std ~318). This ensures the base stock calculation covers the high demand while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering as the pipeline arrivals finally catch up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed (P30-P34): Mean demand has shifted to ~874 units per period with extremely high volatility (standard deviation ~318), a significant increase from the previous late-summer levels.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) is currently in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School regime. Since Period 30, demand has shifted significantly, averaging ~826 units per period (P30-P35) compared to the previous ~435. Period 33 was an extreme outlier at 1,428 units, but demand has since normalized somewhat to 606 in Period 35. This suggests a sustained high-demand level with significant volatility (std dev ~295 for P30-P35). Current on-hand inventory is low (120) with a large in-transit pipeline (4,198) scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods. Since the latest regime started at Period 30, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current trend while smoothing the extreme spike in P33. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P30-P35) average is ~826 units/period, showing high volatility (std dev ~295) and significantly higher volume than late-summer levels (~435).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in an Autumn high-demand regime (starting P30), but recent demand has stabilized lower than the mid-September peak (P33: 1428). Demand for the last two periods (P35: 606, P36: 581) suggests the extreme volatility and peak levels are subsiding as we move later into October. I am setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand Autumn period (P30-P36), which currently averages ~773 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 will ensure we maintain a base stock that accounts for both the high autumn average and the significant volatility observed in P33-P34 without over-ordering as the season potentially begins to wind down towards late October/November.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P30-P36) average stabilized at ~773 units per period, with volatility decreasing compared to the late-September peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has stabilized into an Autumn/post-back-to-school regime. After the extreme spike in P33 (1,428 units), demand has moderated over the last three periods (P35: 606, P36: 581, P37: 643), averaging approximately 610 units per period. This is significantly lower than the peak volatility period (P30-P34 avg ~874) but remains higher than late-summer levels. Inventory is finally recovering from stockouts, with 574 units on-hand and a healthy pipeline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this moderate stabilization (P34-P37) and adjusting sigma_hat to reflect the reduced but still present volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized starting Period 35: Average demand has decreased from the mid-autumn peak (~874) to ~610 units (-30%) over the last three periods (P35-P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has stabilized over the last four periods (P35-P38) with an average of 623.25 units (606, 581, 643, 663) and a standard deviation of 36.5. This follows the high-volatility peak seen in September (P30-P34) where demand averaged 866 units with huge swings. Current on-hand inventory is 1,391 units following the arrival of a large 1,480-unit order from Period 34. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 1,790 units (orders from P35, P36, P37). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the shift to a lower-volume, lower-volatility regime entering November, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this recent stability and avoid over-ordering based on the previous autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in a lower-volatility regime starting Period 35 (approx 623 units/period), down from the high-volatility autumn peak of ~866 units/period (P30-P34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P35) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the autumn peak. The average demand from P35-P39 is 596.6 units, with a noticeable drop in Period 39 to 485. This suggests the high-demand autumn/back-to-school peak has passed. With current on-hand inventory at 1946 and a pipeline of 755 (totaling 2701 units), and the demand trending towards ~500-600 units/period, we are currently well-stocked. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures this post-peak stabilization while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the high volatility seen in the autumn (std dev is significant). The pipeline + on-hand is sufficient for the next 4-5 periods of projected demand, so the OR backend will likely recommend minimal or zero ordering to avoid additional holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand stabilization: Demand has decreased from the P30-P34 average of ~866 to a P35-P39 average of ~597 (-31%), signifying the end of the high-volatility back-to-school peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has entered a stable post-autumn regime since Period 35. Over the last six periods (P35-P40), demand has averaged 593 units (606, 581, 643, 663, 485, 581), showing significantly lower volatility and volume compared to the late-September peak (~874 units). We are currently in mid-November, where demand for core denim typically stabilizes before any potential holiday surges. Current on-hand inventory (1728) plus the immediate pipeline (800 units arriving in P41 and P42) is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (5 periods total) at the current mean of ~600 units (3000 units required vs. ~2528 available). However, we need to maintain the safety stock. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-autumn demand stabilization (P35-P40): Demand has shifted to a mean of ~593 units per period with reduced volatility, down ~32% from the autumn peak (P30-P34 avg ~866).

The current demand regime (P35-P41) shows a mean of approximately 587 units per period, which is a substantial reduction from the peak average of ~866. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 1568 units, and the pipeline (969 units) is well-aligned with this lower demand level. Since the demand has been stable for 7 consecutive periods (P35-P41), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization. Moving into late November (Period 42), the product may see a slight lift from Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but the recent trend is the most reliable predictor for the base stock calculation to avoid overstocking as the core autumn season winds down. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), a massive demand spike of 3,100 units occurred, resulting in a stockout. This timing strongly suggests a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event, typical for this retail calendar period. Similar to the earlier Back-to-School volatility, we see a transient but extreme peak. Demand over P40-P42 has averaged 1,409 units because of this outlier, though the structural mean (excluding the spike) remains around 550-600. The pipeline currently holds 1,478 units from orders in P40-P42. Given the lead time of 4 periods, these units will arrive starting P44. For P43, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 8 (covering P35-P42) to capture both the post-autumn stability and the recent surge, which results in a balanced but responsive base stock. I'll increase sigma_hat explicitly to account for the extreme volatility observed in P42 (the 3,100 units demand), ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer against further holiday spikes or high-volatility residuals.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand hit 3,100 units, significantly exceeding the previous 5-period average of ~570 (+440% increase). High volatility expected through early December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (high-waisted skinny denim) is currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). We just observed the massive Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM) spike in Period 42 (demand=3100) and its partial cooling in Period 43 (demand=674). The stock is currently exhausted (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is congested with 3183 units, including 408 (ordered P40), 556 (P41), 509 (P42), and 1710 (P43). While BFCM is over, demand in early December usually remains elevated due to holiday shopping before tapering off toward the end of the year. The P44 decision mu_hat needs to reflect this 'post-surge but holiday-active' state. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend including the BFCM jump, which weights the forecast towards higher levels to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock for the remaining 4 periods of the year.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand cooling: Demand dropped from 3100 (P42) to 674 (P43) but remains above the pre-holiday baseline (~590). High pipeline levels (3183 units) are expected to arrive between P44 and P47.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday period (P45, Dec 16). Historical demand shows a massive spike during Black Friday/Cyber Monday (P42, 3100 units), followed by a cooling to ~675 units (P43-P44). This cooling is still above the pre-holiday baseline (~590), suggesting a sustained holiday shopping level. High pipeline inventory is currently 5716 units, including large orders from P41 (556), P42 (509), P43 (1710), and P44 (2941). The P41 order is expected to arrive this period (P45), and the P42 spike-response order should arrive next period (P46). Given we are nearly at the end of the game (P47), we must ensure we don't over-order and get caught with high holding costs, while still covering the remaining two periods. The 'late-December' demand usually tapers after Christmas. I will use a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the holiday elevated mean (approx 1000 units/period including the spike) but the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive ordering against the massive pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P44) stabilized at ~677 units, which is ~14% higher than the pre-holiday baseline (~593), indicating a sustained December holiday elevation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2224.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46, which is just before Christmas (Dec 23). Historical demand analysis shows a 'Post-Black Friday' stabilization at approximately 670-680 units (P43-P45), which is higher than the autumn baseline (~593) but significantly lower than the Black Friday spike. However, looking at P42 (Black Friday), the stockout led to a significant 'in-transit' pipeline. Current 'In-transit' is 6431 units, while 'On-hand' is 0. Expected arrivals this period (P46) include the order from P42 (509 units), which may not be enough to satisfy demand if Christmas week presents a final seasonal surge. Following that, the very large orders from P43 (1710), P44 (2941), and P45 (1271) will start arriving from P47 onwards. Given the high pipeline and the game ending soon (Period 47 is the last period information provided in the prompt), the focus is on smoothing the remaining demand without over-ordering into the final period. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current holiday baseline of ~670 units. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the current lower volatility compared to the Nov/Dec transition. L remains at the promised 4 periods as consistently observed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 47 (late December/early January context). Demand has stabilized at approximately 670 units since the post-Black Friday period (P43-P45), but significantly dipped to 475 in P46, likely reflecting the immediate post-Christmas slowdown. The pipeline is heavily loaded with 5,922 units (orders from P43-P45), which are expected to arrive sequentially. Given the lead time of 4 periods, the next major arrival (1,710 units from P43) is due in Period 47 resolution. Because the current inventory (34 units) plus the massive pipeline (5,922 units) far exceeds any reasonable 5-period demand forecast (even at the higher autumn levels of ~800, 5 periods would only require ~4,000 units), the OR backend will cap any new orders to 0. I will keep the demand parameters aligned with the recent holiday-elevated average (prior to the P46 dip) to ensure the system is ready for any post-holiday clearance spikes, though no new ordering is required this period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Christmas demand deceleration: Period 46 demand dropped to 475, down ~30% from the December holiday average (~670).
