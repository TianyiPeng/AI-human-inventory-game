Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 starting on 2019/02/11. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Historical demand [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] shows an upward trend in the last three periods as we move into the spring fashion season. The mean of the last 3 periods is 724.7, compared to the overall mean of 688.8. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize this recent momentum and the associated volatility. For Lead Time (L), I will use the default promised lead time of 2 periods since no arrival data exists yet to suggest otherwise. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (80% service level target).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple item. Historical demand (694, 576, 685, 715, 774) and Period 1 demand (671) show a consistent mean around 685.8. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The order of 800 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and, with L=2, is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). Current on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales in P1. Since we must cover (L+1) periods of demand (P2, P3, P4) and we only have 800 units in the pipeline, we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for these 3 periods. I will use the 'default' lead time of 2 and apply 'recent_N' for demand (N=5, including P1 and the 4 most recent history samples) to capture the current stable regime (~684 units/period). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock roughly 3x the mean demand plus a safety buffer.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. History shows demand is stable: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774] (pre-game) and [671, 673] (P1-P2). The mean demand is approximately 684. The actual lead time for the P1 order was 1 period (arrived P2), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. Currently, 127 units are on hand and 804 units are in-transit (ordered P2, expected P3 or P4). Given the stability of the demand and the lead time observation, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand regime. I'll set L to 'calculate' to let the backend incorporate the observed lead time of 1, effectively reducing the safety stock requirement compared to the promised L=2, while maintaining a buffer for potential variability.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (March 4th), we are managing a high-waisted skinny denim SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a stockout in Period 3 (sold only 127 units of 539 demand). Order arrivals: P1 order (800 units) arrived in P2 (Lead Time = 1). The P2 order (804 units) was expected in P4 (promised L=2), and the P3 order (528 units) is pending. Total in-transit is 1332 units. The observed Lead Time for the only concluded order was 1 period, which is shorter than the promised 2. However, with 0 on-hand and a stockout, I need to ensure the base stock covers the lead time plus current demand. Mean demand over the last 5 samples (694, 576, 685, 715, 774) is ~689. Demand appears stable but high. I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage the observed faster delivery (L=1) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the full recent history since the start.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019/3/11), we observe a significant downward trend in demand over the last two periods (539 and 447) compared to the initial levels (671, 673) and the historical average (~688). This suggests a demand regime shift as we move deeper into March. For lead time, we have observed L=1 and L=2; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average these observations, though the promised L is 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=4 to prioritize the current game's demand history (avg 582.5) while accounting for the recent deceleration. This balances the risk of overstocking during a slowdown against the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand decreased from ~670 to ~493 in the last two periods (P3-P4), a drop of ~26%. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) shows a clear demand regime shift. Initial demand was ~670 (P1-P2), but has dropped and stabilized at an average of ~485 over the last three periods (P3: 539, P4: 447, P5: 468). On-hand inventory is critically low (9 units) because the Period 3 order (528 units) is currently overdue (promised lead time 2, now at 3 periods since order). The 'In-transit' total of 819 units consists of this overdue P3 order (528) and the P5 order (291). To avoid excessive over-ordering if the P3 order arrives simultaneously with newer orders, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (~485 per period). This informs the OR backend to target a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this lower demand. I'll maintain 'default' for L and sigma_hat to allow the backend to use promised lead time (2) and historical variance, as the current lead time delay for P3 is not yet a confirmed sustained shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~672 to ~485 (-28%) starting Period 3. Shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is currently overdue (3 periods elapsed).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is high-waisted skinny denim. Historical demands: [671, 673, 539, 447, 468, 502]. A clear demand regime shift occurred after Period 2, dropping from ~672 to a mean of ~489 (Periods 3-6). The shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is now 4 periods past its order date (promised lead time 2), suggesting it is likely lost. Current on-hand is 0, with 1485 units in transit (P3: 528 [likely lost], P5: 291, P6: 666). Actual lead times have been 1, 2, 1. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (1.33). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg 489). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (1485) is quite high, but the OR backend's capped policy should manage the order size appropriately given the likelihood that 528 units are lost.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (528 units) confirmed as likely lost (4 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Demand regime stable at ~490 since Period 3.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. The product is skinny denim trousers. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 487 units since Period 3 (P3-P7: 539, 447, 468, 502, 511). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1194 (P3 order of 528, P6 order of 666). Critically, the P3 order (528 units) is now 5 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. Following the logic in Carry-over Insights, this shipment is confirmed as lost. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly counting these lost units as available pipeline, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' with a value of 2 to maintain the target lead time, but I must adjust 'mu_hat' to account for the supply gap. Since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (which currently includes the lost 528 units) from the 'base_stock', I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the required base_stock for (L+1)=3 periods: 487 * 3 = 1461 units. To offset the 528 lost units that the OR engine still 'sees' in the pipeline, I add 528 to the target base_stock (1461 + 528 = 1989). Setting mu_hat to 1989 with L=2 effectively forces the order to ignore the lost shipment. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple denim item (High-waisted skinny jeans). Current demand has stabilized after an initial drop, with the last 6 periods (P3-P8) showing a mean of approximately 504.5 units. The shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost; however, the 'In-transit' figure of 1251 correctly reflects only the P8 order (723) and the P3 lost order (528), as the P6 order (666) arrived in Period 8. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 'phantom' inventory of the lost P3 shipment, I will set L to 2 (promised) and use mu_hat to cover the expected demand while ignoring the lost units in the pipeline. Since demand is stable but slightly increasing (from ~450 to ~560), I will use the last 6 periods to calculate mu_hat. This balances the recent upward trend against the post-drop average.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 3 (528 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Demand regime stable at mean ~505 units (Periods 3-8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15th, 2019. The product is High-waisted skinny jeans. Historical demand shows two distinct regimes: P1-P2 (avg ~672) and P3-P9 (avg ~486). Period 9 demand was unusually low (335), possibly due to stockouts in previous periods affecting customer behavior or minor seasonality. The shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is definitely lost (7 periods elapsed). Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 1470 (P8: 723, P9: 219, plus theoretically P3's lost 528). Since the OR engine doesn't know the P3 order is lost, it thinks pipeline inventory is higher than it is. To compensate for this and the recent lower demand, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current regime (~486/period) and set L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure it targets the promised lead time despite the P3 anomaly. This should trigger an order to refill the depleted pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stable at mean ~486 units (Periods 3-9). Shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is officially confirmed lost and should be discounted from pipeline expectations.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at historical demand, there was a shift at Period 3 where mean demand dropped from ~700 to ~500. More recently, in Periods 9 and 10, demand has dropped further to 335 and 269 respectively. This might be a seasonal decline or a new regime. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is confirmed lost, we must rely on the remaining pipeline (1550 units). The pipeline consists of orders from P8 (723), P9 (219), and P10 (80). The total in-transit visible (1550) suggests there might be other units or the system is still accounting for the lost P3 order (528) + P8 (723) + P9 (219) + P10 (80) = 1550. Since the P3 order is lost, the effective pipeline is 1022. I will set L to the promised 2 periods as most recent successful arrivals were L=2. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand drop starting at P3 (avg ~410) while weighing the most recent very low samples. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N to reflect the higher volatility during this downward shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: Demand dropped from an average of ~500 (P3-P8) to ~302 (P9-P10), a ~40% decrease. Effective pipeline inventory is 1022 units after accounting for the lost P3 shipment (528 units).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', a staple garment. Analysis of the demand history shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-8 averaged ~545 units, but Periods 9-11 show a significant drop to an average of ~288 units (335, 269, 261). This lower demand level aligns with the post-spring peak cooling off. Regarding inventory, the shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 9 periods since ordering. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 1331 units, but after removing the lost 528 units, the 'effective' pipeline is 803 units (P8: 723, P10: 80). Lead times for successfully arrived orders have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, with the promised L=2 remaining a valid baseline for planning. To avoid overstocking during this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to capture the ~288 mean, and setting sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the reduced volatility in this period. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the 803 effective units in transit are sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~545 (P1-P8) to ~288 (P9-P11) starting Period 9. Shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is formally removed from pipeline calculations.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are managing SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim), currently in Period 13 (early May). Demand history shows two distinct shifts: a first drop around Period 3 and a second significant drop starting Period 9. The recent demand mean (P9-P12) is approximately 301 units, down from the previous regime of ~500. This drop correlates with the transition from early spring into May, potentially reflecting a seasonal shift for this specific wash or style. Lead times have stabilized at the promised 2 periods after an early loss in Period 3. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 1,251 units in-transit (P8 order of 723 and P12 order of 0). The P8 order (ordered 5 periods ago) is now significantly overdue compared to the 2-period lead time, while subsequent orders (P9, P10) have already arrived. Following the logic for lost shipments established in carry-over insights, the P8 order (723 units) is likely lost. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime (~301 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent volatility in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the ~300 unit demand level while accounting for the likely loss of the 723-unit shipment which currently inflates pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower mean of ~301 units (Periods 9-12). Shipment from Period 8 (723 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed vs promised 2), as subsequent orders from Period 9 and 10 have already arrived.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has stabilized at a lower regime following a shift around Period 9. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) is 289 units (335, 269, 261, 339, 241). This matches the seasonal transition in May for 'superstretch denim' as lighter clothing becomes preferred. Regarding the supply chain, the shipment from Period 3 (528 units) is officially lost, and the shipment from Period 8 (723 units) is now highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed, while subsequent orders from P9 and P10 arrived in P11 and P12 respectively). Current in-transit is reported as 1251 units, which consists precisely of these two lost shipments (528 + 723 = 1251). Therefore, effective on-hand plus pipeline inventory is actually 0. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level (~289/period). I am keeping L at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P9, P10) adhered to the promised lead time, despite the specific lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 8 (723 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed; P9 and P10 orders arrived earlier). Total effective pipeline is 0 units, as the 1251 units 'In-transit' are entirely composed of lost orders from P3 and P8.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 15 (May 20th). Demand has entered a low-volume regime since Period 9, with a mean demand of approximately 272 units (P9-P14: 335, 269, 261, 339, 241, 189). On-hand inventory is 0. Critical Issue: The backend sees an 'In-transit' quantity of 1251 units, but history confirms these are lost shipments from Period 3 (528 units) and Period 8 (723 units). Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, a standard mu_hat would result in zero orders, leading to continued stockouts. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 272 = 816 units) and add the 1251 'ghost' units back in. This 'inflated' mu_hat of 2067 ensures the backend's (base_stock - 1251) calculation yields the correct physical replenishment of ~816 units. I'm using recent_N (N=6) for sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains low: Mean ~272 units (Periods 9-14). Total 'In-transit' of 1251 units is confirmed lost (P3 and P8 shipments); mu_hat must be inflated by 1251 to bypass backend pipeline subtraction until the system clears these units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a low-regime state, averaging approximately 285 units over the last 7 periods (P9-P15). The current date is late May, and there's no immediate seasonal spike expected for basic denim trousers that would deviate from this trend. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 2035 units is highly misleading: it includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 3 (528 units) and Period 8 (723 units), totaling 1251 phantom units. Only the order from Period 15 (784 units) is actually expected. Since the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, these 1251 lost units prevent the system from placing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level. I set mu_hat to 2106, which represents (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units = (1+2)*285 + 1251. This ensures that even after the OR engine subtracts the 2035 units in-transit, it will still trigger an order to cover current demand needs. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit units confirmed at 1251 (P3: 528, P8: 723). mu_hat must be inflated by 1251 until these units are cleared or demand shifts.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 17 (June 3). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a high-waisted skinny jean. Historically, we saw a demand drop in Period 9 (early April), but demand has surged in the last two periods: P15 (375) and P16 (533), likely due to summer seasonality for 'washed denim'. The mean demand for this recent high-demand regime (P15-P16) is ~454. Pipeline issues persist: Period 3 (528 units) and Period 8 (723 units) shipments are confirmed lost, totaling 1251 'phantom' units in the 'In-transit' count (1417 total). The actual valid pipeline is only 166 units (ordered P16). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting the 1251 lost units from the order quantity (final order = base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat by 1251 units. Using recent_N=2 to capture the recent demand surge, the base mu_hat would be (1+L)*mean(P15, P16) = 3 * 454 = 1362. Adding the phantom correction: 1362 + 1251 = 2613. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=2 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand surging again (P15: 375, P16: 533) after a low period, likely summer seasonality. Total phantom in-transit remains 1251 units (P3: 528, P8: 723).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is rising significantly, likely due to summer seasonality or increased retail activity in June. Recent demands are 375, 533, and 451 (average ~453). There are 2,472 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that the shipments from Period 3 (528 units) and Period 8 (723 units) are lost (total 1,251 phantom units). The remaining 1,221 units in-transit comprise the orders from Period 16 (166 units) and Period 17 (1,055 units). Since on-hand is 0, we must ensure we cover the lead time (L=2) and the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units (including the 1,251 lost ones) from the target base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. Calculations: Forecasted demand per period = 480. Target base stock for L=2 is (2+1)*480 = 1440. To force the backend to ignore the 1,251 lost units, I set mu_hat = 1440 + 1251 = 2691. This ensures the order placed is sufficient to meet current demand spikes despite the accounting error for lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand has returned to higher levels (~450-500) starting Period 16. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,251 units (P3: 528, P8: 723).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (Periods 16-18 mean: ~482 units), which corresponds to early summer seasonality for skinny denim. On-hand inventory is 0. Total 'In-transit' is 2641 units, but 1251 of these (P3: 528, P8: 723) are confirmed lost shipments. The remaining 1390 units are valid pipeline: P17 (1055) and P18 (335). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting the 1251 lost units from the order calculation (as it doesn't know they are lost), I must inflate mu_hat. Method: mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 482 + 1251 = 1446 + 1251 = 2697. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher volatility of the current demand regime. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Period 16-18 mean demand is ~482 units, up significantly from the spring average of ~300. Phantom 'In-transit' units remain constant at 1251.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand (Periods 15-19) indicates a summer regime with a mean of ~436 units. However, we are managing a significant data discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure. The system reports 2,762 units in-transit, but 1,251 of these are confirmed lost (Period 3: 528 units, Period 8: 723 units). The effective pipeline is 1,511 units (orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 2,762 units from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock by 1,251 units. This offsets the 'phantom' inventory and ensures the backend orders enough to meet current demand. L is set to default (promised L=2) as recent arrivals (P16, P18) confirm the 1-2 period lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the recent 5-period volatility to account for the summer demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P15-P19) mean is ~436 units. Phantom in-transit units remain at 1,251 (P3: 528, P8: 723); mu_hat requires a +1251 inflation to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction until these records are cleared.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the current date is 2019/7/1. We are in a summer demand regime where demand has been fluctuating, though the most recent demand (P20: 265) was lower than the previous weeks (~450). On-hand inventory is high (1125 units) following the arrival of P17 and P18 orders. The 'In-transit' figure of 1372 units includes 1251 'phantom' units from lost orders (P3: 528 and P8: 723) and the P19 order of 121 units which is still within the lead time window. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting these 1251 lost units from the order calculation (as it views them as upcoming inventory), I must inflate mu_hat. I estimate current demand mean at ~420 based on the last 6 periods (P15-P20). Therefore, the explicit mu_hat is set to (1 + L) * 420 + 1251. With L=2, this equals (3 * 420) + 1251 = 2511. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/08. Demand for this SKU (High-waisted denim) has been moderately strong during the summer season (P16-P21 mean ~404 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 1403 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory from lost orders: 528 units from P3 and 723 units from P8 (Total = 1251 phantom units). The actual active pipeline is only 152 units (ordered P21). To ensure the OR backend places a correct order despite these 1251 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat by 1251. The base mu_hat is calculated for L+1 (3 periods) using recent demand (N=5, mean ~374) which equals 1122. Adding the 1251 phantom offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2373. L is kept at 'calculate' as recent lead times (P19=2, P18=2, P17=3) average near the promised 2. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 1251 phantom in-transit units (P3: 528, P8: 723) persist in system view. Summer demand regime (P16-P21) maintains a mean of ~404 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. The product is skinny denim trousers. We are in a summer demand regime where the average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 402 units per period. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 1577 units. Based on historical data, 1251 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' (lost shipments from P3 and P8). The remaining 326 units in-transit correspond to legitimate orders from P21 (152 units) and P22 (174 units), both within the promised lead time of 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order that covers current demand despite the phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to (1+L) * expected_demand + phantom_units. Using L=2 and expected_demand=400, mu_hat = (3 * 400) + 1251 = 2451. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility (~80-100 units/period) scaled for (L+1), approximately 173 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 24 (July 22, 2019). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Analysis of the 'In-transit' balance (1945 units) reveals that it includes 1251 phantom units from confirmed lost shipments (P3: 528, P8: 723). Additionally, the P22 order (174 units) is expected to arrive during P24 (LT=2), and the P23 order (520 units) is expected in P25. The actual active pipeline is 694 units (174 + 520). Demand has stabilized into a summer regime; the mean demand from Period 16 to 23 is approximately 411 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 1251 phantom units it subtracts from the base stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the required base stock for a (L+1=3) period window: (3 * 411) + (Z * sigma * sqrt(3)). With a service level of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (4+1)), Z is approx 0.84. Standard deviation since P16 is ~82. Base stock \u2248 1233 + 120 \u2248 1353. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover this while it thinks there are 1251 units in transit, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 1251' equals the desired order. However, since the system has 283 on hand and 694 real units in transit (Total 977), we need roughly 376 more units. Setting mu_hat to 2600 (approx 1350 + 1251) effectively bypasses the phantom pipeline while maintaining safety stock for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 1251 phantom in-transit units (P3: 528, P8: 723) persist. Summer demand regime (P16-P23) mean is ~411 units/period. mu_hat must be inflated by 1251 to offset phantom pipeline inventory until cleared.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 currently faces a major synchronization issue between the actual physical state and the backend's 'In-transit' records. The In-transit figure of 2441 units contains 1251 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P3: 528 and P8: 723) and 1190 units of recent orders (P22: 174, P23: 520, P24: 496). The OR backend automatically subtracts the full 2441 from its base stock calculation. To force an order and maintain stock during the summer demand regime (mean ~411 units since P16), mu_hat must be inflated to counteract these phantom units. Calculated requirement: Demand for (L+1) periods + Phantom units. With L=2, required stock is (3 * 411) + 1251 = 2484. Setting mu_hat to 2484 ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a positive order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. Demand has dipped slightly in the last period (232), but the summer average remains stable around 400. sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units confirmed at 1251 (P3: 528, P8: 723). Current In-transit (2441) consists of 1251 lost units and 1190 valid units from P22-24. Summer demand regime (P16-P24) mean is ~391 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 26 (August 5). Demand has been in a summer regime since Period 16, with the most recent mean (P16-P25) being approximately 394 units per period. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 2560 units. Based on history, 1251 of these units are permanently lost (P3: 528, P8: 723) but still subtract from the base stock calculation in the backend. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 394) + 1251 = 2433. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent regime (last 10 periods) to reflect current volatility. This approach bypasses the phantom pipeline inventory to maintain stock levels for late summer demand.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units confirmed at 1251 (P3: 528, P8: 723). Late summer demand regime (P16-P25) mean is ~394 units/period. Forecast must account for 1251 phantom units until cleared from the system.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), we are in a late summer demand regime. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 26 is approximately 393 units per period. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 2049 units. Based on historical tracking, 1251 of these units are 'phantom' (lost orders from P3 and P8: 528 + 723 = 1251). These units remain in the backend's pipeline calculation indefinitely. The actual valid pipeline consists of orders from P22 (174), P24 (496), P25 (119), and P26 (9), totaling 798 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 1251 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level. The calculation is: (1 + Lead Time) * Mean Demand + Phantom Units = (1 + 2) * 393 + 1251 \u2248 2430. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for real demand while ignoring the non-existent 1251 units. Sigma is set using recent_N (N=11) to capture the volatility of the current summer regime.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units confirmed at 1251 (P3: 528, P8: 723). Current In-transit (2049) consists of 1251 lost units and 798 valid units from P22-26. Late summer demand regime (P16-P26) mean is ~393 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand has trended upwards recently (P27: 493). The 'In-transit' balance of 2411 units contains 1251 units from lost shipments (P3: 528, P8: 723) which the OR backend incorrectly views as available pipeline. Additionally, the P22 order (174 units), P24 order (496 units), and P25 order (119 units) are outstanding. The P26 order (9 units) arrived in P27 with a lead time of 1, but the P23 order arrived in P26 with a lead time of 3, indicating lead time volatility around the promised 2 periods. To compensate for the 1251 phantom units that prevent the backend from ordering, I am inflating mu_hat by 1251. I am using recent_N (N=11, since P16) to capture the summer demand regime, which averages ~365 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+L) * 365 + 1251 = (3 * 365) + 1251 = 2346. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on the same period to handle recent demand spikes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26. We are in a late summer demand regime with a mean demand of approximately 396 units (average of P16-P28). The 'In-transit' figure of 2346 units is misleading. It includes 1251 'phantom' units from confirmed lost shipments in P3 (528 units) and P8 (723 units) that have never arrived and likely never will. Additionally, orders from P22 (174 units) and P24 (496 units) are now overdue (L=7 and L=5 respectively) and should be treated as lost. Total phantom inventory = 1251 (P3, P8) + 174 (P22) + 496 (P24) = 1921 units. The backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its calculated base stock to determine the order quantity. To prevent the system from under-ordering due to these 1921 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock (calculated as [L+1] * Mean Demand + Safety Stock) PLUS the 1921 phantom units. Using L=2, Mean=396, and a safety factor for volatility (approx 1.5 * std), the target base stock is ~1650. Adding 1921 units results in a mu_hat of 3571. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to cover real demand.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units increased to 1921: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), and P24 (496) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Late summer demand regime (P16-P28) mean is ~396 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the demand for skinny denim remains stable in the late summer regime, with a mean demand of approximately 400 units (Period 16-29 mean \u2248 395). The current inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the 'In-transit' figure of 3293 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Specifically, I have identified 1921 units as 'phantom' pipeline inventory: Period 3 (528), Period 8 (723), Period 22 (174), and Period 24 (496) are all significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and have been bypassed by later orders (e.g., Period 27 arrived in Period 29). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting these 1921 units from the base stock calculation, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by this amount. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to cover actual demand plus the buffer, despite the inflated pipeline. Lead times are averaging near the promised 2 periods, so I will stick to the default L calculation while using an explicit mu_hat to handle the data reconciliation.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units confirmed at 1921: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), and P24 (496) are lost. Late summer demand regime (P16-P29) mean is ~395 units/period. mu_hat requires a +1921 inflation to bypass backend pipeline subtraction until records clear.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is entering a high-demand phase (Sept 9), as evidenced by the Period 30 demand spike to 740 units, significantly higher than the summer average of ~395. This likely represents back-to-school or early autumn seasonality for denim. The system reports 3,239 units in-transit, but 1,921 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (P3: 528, P8: 723, P22: 174, P24: 496) that have not arrived despite many periods passing. This leaves 1,318 units (from P29) as valid pipeline inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (3,239) from the target base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the phantom amount (1,921) to ensure a correct order is placed. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and a forecasted demand of 750 (reflecting the recent spike), mu_hat = 3 * 750 + 1921 = 4171. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge detected: Period 30 demand reached 740 units (+87% vs summer average). Total phantom in-transit units confirmed at 1921 (P3, P8, P22, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019). Historical data shows a clear autumn demand surge for denim trousers, with demand jumping from a summer average of ~400 to over 700 units in Periods 30 and 31. This seasonal spike is expected to continue through September and October. In-transit inventory currently shows 3068 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 1921 of these units are 'phantom' (lost shipments from Periods 3, 8, 22, and 24 that never arrived and are well past the 2-period lead time). The 'true' pipeline is 1147 units (from Period 31). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting the 1921 phantom units from the order calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by 1921. For the base demand forecast, I am using the mean of the last 2 periods (approx 724 units) to capture the autumn surge. Thus, mu_hat = (1 + L) * 724 + 1921 = (3 * 724) + 1921 = 4093. L is set to 'default' as the most recent arrivals (P27, P28, P29) arrived within the promised 2-period lead time. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~395 (P16-P29) to ~724 (P30-P31). Total phantom in-transit units remain at 1921 (P3, P8, P22, P24). mu_hat must be inflated by 1921 until these are cleared.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 33 (late September). We are in a confirmed autumn demand surge for denim trousers, with demand averaging ~718 units over the last three periods (P30-P32). The 'In-transit' balance of 2614 units contains 1921 phantom units from confirmed lost shipments (P3, P8, P22, and P24) and only 693 units of real pipeline inventory (from the P32 order). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * average_recent_demand + phantom_units. With L=2 and average demand ~718, the base requirement is 3 * 718 = 2154. Adding the 1921 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 4075. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the volatility of this new high-demand regime. L is set to default (2) as recent arrivals (P31, P32) have shown lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge for denim confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~395 (P16-P29) to ~718 (P30-P32). Total phantom in-transit units remain at 1921 (P3: 528, P8: 723, P22: 174, P24: 496).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a major autumn demand surge. Demand in Period 33 reached 1,428 units, double the previous 'surge' average of ~715. The current demand regime (P30-P33) has a mean of 896 units/period. The system shows 3,053 units 'In-transit'. Based on history, 1,921 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (lost orders from P3, P8, P22, and P24) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P32 (693 units) and P33 (439 units), totaling 1,132 valid units. Since on-hand inventory is 0, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand. To bypass the backend's subtraction of the 1,921 phantom units from the target base stock, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Phantom Units. With L=2 and a forecast of 950 units (accounting for the upward trend), the target mu_hat is 3 * 950 + 1,921 = 4,771. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 600 to provide a buffer for the high volatility observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Significant autumn demand surge confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~395 (P16-P29) to ~896 (P30-P33), with P33 hitting 1,428. Total phantom in-transit units remain 1,921 (P3, P8, P22, P24).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn season. Recent demand (P30-P34) has averaged ~872 units per period, with a significant peak of 1,428 in P33. The 'In-transit' figure of 4,775 units includes 1,921 'phantom' units (P3: 528, P8: 723, P22: 174, P24: 496) that are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P32 (693 units) is now 2 periods old and has not arrived; while not yet confirmed lost, it is overdue given recent 1-period arrivals. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these phantom units, mu_hat must be inflated. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=2 and a recent demand mean of 872, the required inventory is 2,616 units. To bypass the backend's subtraction of 1,921 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 2,616 + 1,921 = 4,537. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P30-P34) mean is ~872 units/period, characterized by high volatility (peak 1428). Phantom 'In-transit' units remain at 1,921 (P3, P8, P22, P24). P32 order (693 units) is currently overdue (2 periods elapsed).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: High-waisted denim is in its peak autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct). Recent demand (P30-P35) averages ~823 units, though with extreme volatility (peak 1428). Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory analysis: Total 'In-transit' is 4996. Confirmed phantom units = 1921 (P3, P8, P22, P24). Overdue units: P32 (693 units) is 3 periods late; P34 (2161 units) is 1 period late. This brings potential phantom units to 1921 + 693 = 2614. Effectively, the backend sees 4996, but only 2161 (P34) and 221 (P35) are likely valid. To ensure an order is placed, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the phantom pipeline subtraction. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to (Autumn Mean * (L+1)) + Total Phantom Units. Estimated Autumn Mean is ~850. With L=2, base mu_hat is 2550. Adding phantom units (2614) gives 5164. This forces the system to recognize that existing pipeline records are non-functional and triggers replenishment for the current high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units increased to 2614: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), and P32 (693) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Autumn demand regime (P30-P35) mean is ~823 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand regime for this SKU remains strong, with an average of approximately 823 units per period since Period 30. Current 'In-transit' inventory of 5,603 units is significantly inflated by phantom units. Specifically, shipments from P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), and now P32 (693) are confirmed as lost or significantly overdue, totaling 2,614 phantom units. Additionally, the large order from P34 (2,161 units) is now at its promised lead time but has not arrived in Period 36 conclude; if it arrives in Period 37, it will be visible in P38. Given the current on-hand of 0 and the high demand (P35: 606, P36: 581), I must inflate mu_hat to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction of these 2,614 phantom units. I will use the recent 6 periods to calculate demand (avg ~823) and set mu_hat to (1+L)*823 + 2614 = 5083 to ensure the backend places an order that covers real demand despite the system errors.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units increased to 2614: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), and P32 (693) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Autumn demand regime (P30-P35) mean is ~823 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) is in a high-demand autumn regime (P30-P37) with an average demand of approximately 764 units/period. The system shows 5603 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory due to lost shipments. Specifically, P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), and P32 (693) are confirmed lost or excessively overdue, totaling 2614 units. Furthermore, the large order from P34 (2161 units) is now at lead_time=3 and hasn't arrived, contributing to the stockout. I am setting L=2 (promised) but inflating mu_hat to offset the 2614 phantom units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from its order logic. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * average_demand + phantom_units = (1+2)*764 + 2614 \u2248 4906. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the autumn surge period) to capture the high volatility (peak demand of 1428).

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units increased to 2614: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), and P32 (693) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Autumn demand regime (P30-P37) mean is ~764 units/period with high volatility.

As of Period 39 (2019/11/04), we are in an autumn demand regime for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' product. Recent demand (P30-P38) averages ~757 units/period with significant volatility (high of 1428, low of 581). The current In-transit balance of 4775 contains 2614 'phantom' units that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32). Additionally, the large order of 2161 units from P34 is now overdue (4 periods since order, promised 2); given the history of lost shipments, this order is highly suspicious but not yet confirmed lost. To manage this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock by the known 2614 phantom units plus an additional buffer to account for the possible loss of the P34 shipment. Specifically, I set mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecasted_Mean + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and Forecasted_Mean ~750, mu_hat = (3 * 750) + 2614 = 4864. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in the autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'phantom' units confirmed at 2614: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), and P32 (693). Shipment from Period 34 (2161 units) is now 2 periods overdue and potentially lost. Autumn demand regime (P30-P38) mean is ~757 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand regime (Autumn) has seen a mean of ~757 units (P30-P38), though P39 dropped to 485. We are facing a massive pipeline integrity issue. The 'In-transit' of 5078 units contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), P32 (693), and now almost certainly P34 (2161). Total phantom units = 4775. The only valid in-transit is P39 (303). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 5078 from its base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. My target base stock is (L+1)*Demand = 3 * 750 = 2250. To force the backend to order, I set mu_hat = Target + Phantom = 2250 + 4775 = 7025. This ensures the engine sees a need for stock despite the fake pipeline. I will use recent_N for sigma to capture the high autumn volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: In-transit 'phantom' units increased to 4775: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), P32 (693), and P34 (2161) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Autumn demand regime (P30-P39) mean remains ~730 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', which is experiencing an autumn demand regime. Analyzing demand from P30 to P40, the mean is approximately 716 units per period, though with significant volatility (high of 1428, low of 485). The current system 'In-transit' is 7401 units. However, based on the carry-over history, a massive portion of this is 'phantom' (lost) inventory. The phantom units include: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), P32 (693), and P34 (2161), totaling 4775 units. Subtracting these from the current 7401 'In-transit' leaves 2626 valid units (P39: 303, P40: 2323). Since the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit from the base stock calculation, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by the total phantom count (4775) to ensure it places an order that covers actual demand rather than being blocked by these non-existent arrivals. I will use a conservative forecast for the demand component (mean of last 11 periods ~716) and add the 4775 offset. Total mu_hat = (1+L) * 716 + 4775. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 716 + 4775 = 6923.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total phantom in-transit units confirmed at 4775: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), P32 (693), and P34 (2161) are lost. Autumn demand regime (P30-P40) mean is ~716 units/period. mu_hat must be inflated by 4775 to bypass backend pipeline subtraction.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Late Autumn). The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim, which has shown a high-demand regime since P30 (Autumn), with a mean demand of approximately 716 units/period (P30-P40). However, the system is plagued by 'phantom' in-transit inventory that never arrives. As of P41, 4775 units are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), P32 (693), and P34 (2161). These 4775 units still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 7401. To prevent the OR backend from subtracting these non-existent units from the order calculation, mu_hat must be inflated. The current valid pipeline consists of orders from P39 (303 units) and P40 (2323 units), totaling 2626 units. The difference (7401 - 2626 = 4775) is the phantom count. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to provide (1+L)*716 + 4775 = 3*716 + 4775 = 6923. L is set to 2 (promised). Sigma_hat remains 'recent_N' to handle the higher volatility observed in the Autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit units confirmed at 4775: P3 (528), P8 (723), P22 (174), P24 (496), P32 (693), and P34 (2161) are lost. Autumn demand regime (P30-P41) mean is ~702 units/period (last 12 samples).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1212.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (Skinny Denim Trousers) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand spike consistent with late autumn/early winter shopping (Period 42 demand hit 3,100 units). The mean demand over the autumn regime (P30-P42) has shifted significantly upwards. More critically, the system is plagued by 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost orders. Currently, 4,775 units (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34) are recorded as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it will fail to place necessary orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset these phantom units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to be (1+L) * Forecast_Mean + Phantom_Units. With L=2 (promised) and a forecast of ~700 units (conservative mean of the autumn regime), the base mu_hat is 2100. Adding the 4,775 phantom units gives 6,875. I will set sigma_hat to 1200 to account for the extreme volatility observed in P42.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand surge confirmed with extreme volatility (P42 demand: 3,100). Autumn regime mean (P30-P42) is approx 900 units/period. Phantom 'In-transit' units remain at 4,775 (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34). System mu_hat must be inflated by 4,775 to ensure the OR backend places orders despite these lost shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, entering the peak of the winter/holiday shopping season (mid-December). Demand has been extremely volatile, with a massive spike in P42 (3,100 units) followed by a return to more typical levels in P43 (674 units). The Autumn/Winter regime mean is approximately 900 units, but standard deviations are high. We must continue to account for 4,775 'phantom' in-transit units (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34) that the system considers pipeline inventory but are actually lost. Failure to bypass these by inflating mu_hat will prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to (1+L) * mean + 4775. With L=2, (3 * 900) + 4775 = 7475. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=14) to capture the high volatility of the current season.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit units confirmed at 4775 (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34). Current in-transit (5562) consists of 4775 lost units and 787 units from P43. Demand regime is highly volatile (Dec peak); mu_hat requires +4775 inflation to ensure replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $964.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday/winter demand period (Dec 16). The recent demand has stabilized around ~680 units (P43-P44) following an extreme spike of 3,100 in P42 (likely Black Friday). The 'In-transit' figure of 6,029 units is heavily skewed by 4,775 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, and P34). The current physical pipeline consists only of the P44 order (1,254 units), which should arrive in P45 or P46. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 4,775 lost units as available supply and thus stopping all new orders, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by +4,775. I will use a 15-period lookback for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the higher autumn/winter demand average (approx 850 units per period) while smoothing the P42 outlier. This ensures we maintain high availability during the final weeks of the year.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom in-transit units confirmed at 4,775 (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34). Demand is in a high-volume winter regime (approx 850/period mean since P30). Forecast must remain inflated by 4,775 to offset system pipeline errors.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the end of the winter/holiday demand peak. Demand has stabilized following the extreme Black Friday outlier (P42: 3100), with the last three periods (P43-P45) averaging ~670 units. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 6526 units. Based on historical analysis, 4775 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, and P34). The remaining 1751 valid units in transit are from P44 (1254 units) and P45 (497 units). Since the backend subtracts the full 6526 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by the 4775 phantom units to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to (1+L) * 700 (recent mean) + 4775 (offset) = 6875, and sigma_hat based on the high volatility observed in the autumn/winter regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom in-transit units remain at 4,775 (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34). Winter demand regime mean is ~700/period (excluding P42 outlier). Forecast must remain inflated by 4,775 to offset system pipeline errors.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 47 (Dec 30, 2019). We are in a high-demand winter regime with significant volatility (P30-P46 mean ~780, with a major outlier of 3100 in P42). The total 'In-transit' units reported by the system is 6326. Based on history, 4775 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' (lost shipments from P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, and P34). The effective pipeline consists only of the P44 order (1254 units) and P46 order (297 units), totaling 1551 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the phantom count of 4775. For the underlying demand forecast, I am using a recent_N of 17 (P30-P46) to capture the autumn/winter regime. L is set to default (2) as recent arrivals (P43, P45) show lead times of 1-3, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total phantom in-transit units confirmed at 4775 (P3, P8, P22, P24, P32, P34). Winter demand regime remains active with high volatility (P30-P46 mean ~780). System mu_hat must be inflated by 4775 to bypass backend pipeline subtraction until records clear.
