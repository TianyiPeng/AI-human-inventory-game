Orders placed in P1 will arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in P4's decision phase. d) Pipeline: On-hand and In-transit are both 0. e) Order Logic: To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), I need enough stock to satisfy approximately 689 * 3 = 2,067 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are 0, I will order a quantity slightly above the historical average for three periods to establish a safety stock cushion, aiming for 2,100 units.",

Assuming an average demand of ~700, the 2100 units cover roughly 3 periods of demand (P2, P3, P4).

The existing in-transit (2100) covers this. However, we have a backlog of lost sales from P1 (671 units) and P2 will also likely result in lost sales since on-hand is 0.

P8 saw a spike to 560, followed by a significant drop to 335 in P9. This volatility (from 560 to 335) suggests that while there is seasonal interest in April (Spring), there is no stable 'new regime' yet.

Historical data shows a clear demand regime shift starting in mid-April (Period 9), where demand dropped from ~500 to a new average of ~289 (mean of Periods 9-13: 335, 269, 261, 339, 241). This likely reflects a seasonal transition away from heavy denim as late Spring/Summer approaches. Lead times are inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 8 (510 units) is confirmed lost. Current on-hand is 180. In-transit consists of 500 units ordered in Period 13 (due Period 15/16) and 510 units from Period 8 (lost). Effective in-transit is therefore 500 units. My pipeline (On-hand 180 + In-transit 500) equals 680 units, which covers roughly 2.3 periods of demand at the current 289-unit rate. Given a 2-3 period lead time, I need to maintain a pipeline for at least 4 periods (L+1 + safety stock) to avoid stockouts. Targeting a 4-period window at 290 demand = 1160 units. Requirement: 1160 - 680 = 480 units.",

Following the significant seasonal peak in September (average ~900+), demand has stabilized in October and early November to a range of 485-663 units per period (average ~600). The current date is Nov 11, moving into the holiday season where denim typically maintains steady demand. Looking at the pipeline, we have 352 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' total of 4440 units includes several confirmed/highly likely lost orders: P24 (450), P31 (700), P32 (700), and P34 (1000). Subtracting these lost units (2850), the active pipeline is approximately 1590 units (P38: 800, P39: 500, and remaining fragments). Lead times are currently volatile between 1-3 periods. To cover the next 3 periods of demand (estimated at 600 units/period) while accounting for potential delays and the high cost of stockouts vs. relatively low holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I will place a maintenance order of 650 units to ensure the pipeline remains robust as we approach the end of the year.",

This mirrors the high-intensity seasonal peak observed in late September but at more than double the magnitude. Historical November demand (pre-peak) was averaging ~530 units. Given that we are now in the week starting December 2nd (Cyber Monday week), a high level of residual promotional demand is expected before a typical December cooling. The 'In-transit' pipeline is 4940 units, which includes orders from P40 (650), P41 (550), and P42 (600), plus a discrepancy of 3140 units. Checking the history, P32 (700) and P34 (1000) were previously flagged as lost but never arrived; however, total in-transit is surprisingly high, suggesting either very late arrivals or systemic noise. With on-hand at 0, I must order to cover the likely 2-3 period lead time. Assuming demand stays elevated for 1-2 more periods (~1000-1500) before dropping back to a winter mean (~500), I need approximately 2500-3000 units in the immediate pipeline.

Historically, demand for this skinny denim SKU peaked significantly during the Black Friday week (P42: 3100 units) and remained elevated through Cyber Monday (P43: 674 units). We are now moving into the pre-Christmas stabilization phase. Given the product category (skinny jeans), demand is expected to remain healthy but trend downwards from the November peak toward a more sustainable winter average of ~500-600 units. Regarding lead times, the last few arrivals (P38-P43) have consistently shown a lead time of 3 periods. Looking at the pipeline: P41 (550), P42 (600), and P43 (800) are in transit. We have 0 on-hand. Based on the 3-period lead time, the P41 order (550 units) is expected to arrive during P44's resolution phase. The P42 order (600 units) is expected in P45, and P43 (800 units) in P46. With only 4 periods left in the game (P44-P47), we must ensure we don't over-order and get stuck with holding costs at the end, while still covering the remaining demand. Total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47) is approximately 2200 units (550 units/period). Total pipeline is 1950 units.
