======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical Pattern: The last five observations show an upward trend (694, 576, 685, 715, 774), moving from a dip back up to a recent high. 2) Seasonal/Calendar: February 11th follows the post-holiday slump and precedes the spring fashion transition. As 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is a staple item in the 'Divided' (youth/fast-fashion) collection, demand often stabilizes or grows as customers refresh wardrobes for spring. 3) Recent Trend: There is a clear upward trajectory over the last three periods (685 -> 715 -> 774), suggesting increasing momentum. 4) Final Forecast: Given the sustained growth in the last three data points and the timing in mid-February, I expect a slight further increase or stabilization near the recent peak. I will forecast a value reflecting this positive momentum.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend observed: Demand increased from 685 to 774 (+13%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data showed a mean of 688.8 units with an upward trend peaking at 774. 2. Recent Performance: Period 1 (Feb 11) actual demand was 671, which is a decline from the end of the training period (774) and slightly below the historical average. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: Feb 18 is mid-February. In fashion retail, this period often sees a stabilization after the initial spring collection launch. The product (High-waisted skinny jeans) is a staple item with year-round demand but may see slight cooling after an initial early-Feb peak. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the drop to 671 in Period 1, the previous upward trend has stalled. I expect demand to stabilize around the long-term mean (688) as the market absorbs the early spring push. I will forecast a slight recovery towards the historical average.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a late-period surge (reaching 774), but the two most recent observed periods (Period 1 and Period 2) show a stabilization and slight downward shift to a mean of 672. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple item. February 25th marks the transition into early spring fashion cycles, which typically maintains steady demand for denim. Given the stability between Period 1 (671) and Period 2 (673), I expect the demand to remain consistent with this recent baseline. There are no major retail holidays or calendar anomalies in the final week of February that would suggest a significant spike or drop.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data showed a range between 576 and 774 with an upward trend toward the end. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. This coincides with the transition into spring fashion in the Northern Hemisphere. High-waisted skinny denim is a staple item typically seeing stable or increasing demand as spring shopping begins. 3. Recent Trend: Observed demand in the test phase shows a decline from ~670 down to 539 in Period 3 (-20%). However, the previous 'Carry-over Insight' noted an upward trend prior to this. The dip in Period 3 (late Feb) might be a temporary fluctuation before the March spring lift. 4. Forecast Logic: While Period 3 was low (539), the historical mean is higher (~680). Given the start of March, a recovery toward the historical average is expected, though tempered by the recent weak Period 3 performance. I anticipate a return toward the 620-650 range.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Demand initially started strong around 671-673 units but has shown a sharp decline over the last two periods (539 to 447). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 11. In many retail markets, this is a transition period into spring. While denim is year-round, the 'superstretch skinny' style often sees shifts as weather warms or spring collections launch. 3. Recent Trend: There is a clear downward regime shift. Demand dropped by 20% in Period 3 and another 17% in Period 4. The previous carry-over insight of an upward trend is now invalidated by current data. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the consistent decline (673 -> 539 -> 447), I expect demand to continue to soften or stabilize at a lower level. Predicting a further slight decrease to 410 units based on the current momentum.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed: Demand decreased from an average of ~672 in Periods 1-2 to 447 in Period 4 (-33%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) shows a significant downward shift starting around Period 3. Initial demand was stable around 672 units (Periods 1-2), but dropped to an average of 457 units over the last two periods (Periods 4-5). The current date (2019/3/18) is mid-March, which typically marks a transition into spring fashion; however, the recent trend shows stabilization after the sharp drop from the 600s to the 400s. Period 5 (468) showed a slight recovery from Period 4 (447). Given the recent 3-period trend of lower demand (539, 447, 468), I expect demand to remain in the mid-to-high 400s as it stabilizes at this new lower level.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) shows a significant drop-off from the high 600s in early February to a low of 447 in early March. However, the last two periods (5 and 6) indicate a recovery and a developing upward trend (447 -> 468 -> 502). As we move into late March (2019/3/25), we are entering the peak spring fashion season where 'High-waisted jeans' and 'Divided collection' items typically see increased interest. The growth between Period 5 and 6 was approximately 7%. Given the steady climb and seasonal alignment with spring shopping, I expect demand to continue rising toward the mid-500s.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Since Period 4, demand has increased for 3 consecutive periods (447 to 502, +12%), reversing the previous downward trend.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a demand drop from Period 2 to 4 (673 to 447), followed by a sustained recovery over the last three periods (468, 502, 511). The current date is April 1st, entering the peak spring fashion season. For the product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', spring typically drives higher demand as consumers refresh wardrobes. Recent growth has stabilized at a moderate pace (+2% in the last period). Given the upward trend and the seasonal entry into April, I expect a continued but modest increase in demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) showed a decline from ~670 (Periods 1-2) to a low of 447 (Period 4). Since then, a consistent recovery trend has emerged: Period 5 (468), Period 6 (502), Period 7 (511), and Period 8 (560). This represents four consecutive periods of growth, averaging a ~6% weekly increase during this recovery phase. The current date (April 8) aligns with the Spring fashion season, where denim typically sees sustained interest. Given the most recent jump from 511 to 560 (+9.5%), I expect the upward momentum to continue. I am forecasting a similar growth increment for Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward trend confirmed: Demand has increased for 4 consecutive periods (447 to 560, +25% total), establishing a new growth regime following the Period 4 trough.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) showed a recovery trend from Period 4 (447) to Period 8 (560). However, Period 9 (2019/04/08) saw a sharp decline to 335 units, a 40% drop from the previous week. This drop occurred right before the current date of April 15th, which aligns with the week leading into Easter 2019 (Easter Sunday was April 21). Often, retail demand for basic apparel can dip immediately before a holiday weekend as consumer focus shifts to travel or specific holiday items, or it could represent a post-promotion lull. Given the 'superstretch' and 'skinny' nature of the product, it remains a staple. The forecast assumes a partial recovery from the Period 9 outlier as the holiday period concludes, but remains conservative given the sudden shift. I will project a mean-reverting increase towards the recent average (excluding the outlier) but tempered by the recent low.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) showed a recovery phase between Periods 4 and 8, peaking at 560 units. However, the last two periods (9 and 10) have shown a sharp and sudden decline, dropping from 560 to 335 (-40%) and then to 269 (-20% week-over-week). The current date is April 22, 2019, which is the Monday after Easter Sunday (April 21). This suggests that the recent sharp drop was likely driven by the end of the pre-Easter shopping season. Period 11 covers the week following Easter, a period typically characterized by a post-holiday lull in retail demand. Given the strong downward momentum (averaging ~302 over the last two weeks) and the post-holiday timing, I expect demand to stabilize at a lower level or see a slight further decrease before plateauing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Post-Easter decline confirmed, with demand dropping from a peak of 560 to an average of 302 (-46%) over the last two periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 9 (April 8th). After a pre-Easter peak of 560 units, demand dropped sharply and has stabilized at a much lower level. Specifically, the last three periods (9, 10, and 11) recorded 335, 269, and 261 units respectively. This represents a post-holiday correction and a potential seasonal shift as spring progresses. The demand has flattened over the last two weeks (269 vs 261), suggesting a new baseline has been reached around the ~265 unit mark. For Period 12 (April 29th), there are no major retail holidays or calendar events to drive a significant spike. Given the recent stabilization, I expect the demand to remain consistent with the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand baseline established: Following the post-Easter decline, demand has stabilized over the last 3 periods (9-11) at an average of 288 units, down from the previous regime average of ~510.

Predicted demand: 260 units

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) showed a significant regime shift starting in Period 9 (post-Easter), where demand dropped from a peak of 560 to a lower baseline. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 10-12), demand has stabilized and begun a slight recovery from its trough of 261. Period 12 saw a notable increase to 339 units, possibly indicating the start of a spring/summer seasonal lift or a reversion to a higher mean after the post-holiday slump. Given the stabilization at an average of approximately 290-300 over the last 4 periods and the momentum from the previous week's increase, the forecast anticipates a slight continued rise to stabilize around the 340-350 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the post-Easter drop, demand has stabilized over 4 periods (9-12) at a new average of 301, with signs of a gradual recovery starting in Period 12 (+30% from Period 11).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) shows high volatility. After an initial high average (~670), demand troughed at Period 4 (447), recovered to a peak at Period 8 (560) around the Easter buildup, and then underwent a regime shift downward. Over the last five periods (9-13), demand has averaged approximately 289 units. Specifically, the most recent demand (Period 13) was 241, following a brief spike to 339 in Period 12. There are no major retail holidays on May 13th in the primary markets likely to cause a significant spike. Given the recent fluctuation between 241 and 339, and the stabilization around a 300-unit mean, the forecast expects a slight regression toward the recent mean while respecting the downward pressure seen in the most recent week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has shown a clear downward trajectory over the last two periods, falling from 241 (Period 13) to 189 (Period 14). This drop significantly violates the previously identified stabilization baseline of ~300 units established between Periods 9-12. As we move into late May (Current Date: 2019/05/20), the shift toward warmer weather likely reduces consumer interest in 'heavy superstretch denim' compared to lighter seasonal alternatives. Given the 21.5% decrease observed in the most recent period, I anticipate demand will continue to soften or stabilize at this new lower floor. My forecast weights the recent sharp decline and seasonal transition heavily.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend continuation: Demand has dropped significantly below the previously established baseline of 301, reaching a new low of 189 in Period 14 (-37% vs P13-P14 average).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has shown significant volatility in the recent five periods (261, 339, 241, 189, 375). After hitting a low of 189 in Period 14, demand surged to 375 in Period 15 (+98%). This spike aligns with the lead-up to the Memorial Day (US) and Spring Bank Holiday (UK) weekend on May 27th. Historically, the demand regime has shifted from an average of ~510 in early spring to a lower baseline of ~280-300 in late April/early May. Period 15 represents a break from the downward trend identified in the previous period. Given the current date is the holiday itself (May 27), demand is expected to remain elevated due to retail promotions and holiday shopping traffic, though it may see a slight normalization from the immediate pre-holiday peak. I forecast a demand of 360, maintaining the higher level established in Period 15 but accounting for a minor post-peak stabilization.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant recovery following the Period 14 trough (189). Demand has spiked for two consecutive periods: 375 (+98%) and 533 (+42%), returning the SKU to demand levels last seen in the Period 1\u20138 regime (avg ~534). The current date (June 3, 2019) enters the summer season, where 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'\u2014a versatile wardrobe staple\u2014often sees sustained interest before the high-summer dip. Given the momentum from Period 15 and 16, I expect demand to remain elevated but show a slight deceleration as it reaches the previous resistance level near 560.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime confirmed: Since Period 14, demand has surged from 189 to 533 (+182%) over 3 periods, returning to the pre-Easter average (~534).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown significant volatility in recent weeks. After hitting a low of 189 in Period 14, demand experienced a sharp 'recovery regime' as noted in the Carry-Over Insights, peaking at 533 in Period 16 before softening to 451 in Period 17 (-15%). Historically, this product (high-waisted superstretch denim) is a staple item, but the current date (June 10th) falls within the start of the summer season where demand for full-length denim often faces slight downward pressure in favor of seasonal wear. The recent drop from 533 to 451 suggests the peak of the recovery has passed and demand is beginning to stabilize at a higher level than the April/May slump. I expect a further moderate consolidation as it settles into a mid-summer baseline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) shows high volatility with distinct regimes. After a significant recovery from Period 14 (189 units) to Period 16 (533 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P16-P18) at an average of 482 units (533, 451, 462). The current date (June 17, 2019) is mid-summer, typically a stable period for denim before late-summer/back-to-school surges. There is no evidence of a new sharp trend in the last three data points; instead, we see a consolidation following the previous recovery. I will forecast a value near the recent 3-period average, accounting for the slight upward nudge from P17 to P18.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Since Period 16, demand has established a new high-summer baseline averaging 482 units, effectively maintaining the recovery gains from May.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 showed a strong recovery throughout late May and early June, establishing a high-summer baseline of approximately 482 units (Periods 16-18). However, Period 19 (June 17) saw a significant decline to 358 units, a 22.5% drop from the previous period. As of June 24 (Period 20), we are at the peak of summer, where consumer preference often shifts from full-length skinny denim toward lighter seasonal apparel or awaits summer clearance events. The sharp drop in Period 19 suggests the early-summer peak has concluded. I forecast a continued softening of demand, aligning with the downward momentum observed in the most recent period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant downward trend over the last two periods (P19: 358, P20: 265), dropping well below the previous 'high-summer' average of 482 units identified in Period 19's carry-over insight. This decline (-25% in P19, -26% in P20) suggests the end of the early-summer demand peak for skinny denim as consumer preferences shift toward lighter seasonal wear or as the initial impact of summer promotional periods fades. Given the Current Date (July 1st), we are entering the peak of summer heat in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically correlates with lower demand for heavy denim trousers. The forecast anticipates a continuation of this downward trajectory, though at a decelerating rate as demand approaches the historical floor observed in May (~189-240 units).

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed: Demand has decreased for two consecutive periods (462 to 265, -42%), breaking the high-summer baseline of 482 units and signaling a seasonal shift away from denim.

(1) Historical analysis: Demand has shifted through several regimes, recently peaking in mid-June at ~480 units before dropping. (2) Seasonal/Calendar: Early July is often characterized by summer sales transitions. For this denim SKU, we are seeing a step down from peak summer levels. (3) Recent trend: Demand hit a local trough in Period 20 (265 units) and recovered to 353 units in Period 21. The average of the last three periods (P19-P21) is 325 units. (4) Forecast logic: While Period 21 showed a recovery, the overall momentum since mid-June remains negative compared to the previous ~480 baseline. I expect demand to stabilize between the recent low (265) and the recent high (353), favoring a slight regression toward the 3-period mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: High-summer baseline of ~482 units has ended, with the last 3 periods (P19-P21) establishing a lower trading range averaging 325 units (-33%).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product showed a significant dip in late June (Period 20: 265), likely due to high-summer seasonality. However, demand has rebounded for two consecutive periods, rising to 353 and 393 (+48% since the trough). This recovery aligns with the mid-July retail period where consumers begin transitioning toward staple items or early pre-fall shopping. Given the recent growth of 40 units between P21 and P22, I expect the upward momentum to continue but moderate slightly as it approaches the previous early-summer baseline of ~450. Therefore, I forecast a continued increase to 420.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has transitioned through several seasonal phases. After a mid-summer low in Period 20 (265 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P21-P23) with observations of 353, 393, and 369 units respectively. This creates a new short-term trading average of approximately 372 units. The late July period (2019/7/22) typically represents the tail end of summer clearance and the very beginning of the 'Back to School' transition for denim products, which often sees a gradual increase in interest for staple trousers. Given the slight softening from P22 to P23 (-6%) and the lack of major promotional events in late July, I expect demand to remain relatively flat or slightly lower as consumers wait for August refreshes. I will forecast a value near the recent 3-period average, accounting for the minor downward movement seen in the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the Period 20 low, demand has established a new baseline over the last 3 periods (P21-P23) averaging 372 units (+14% vs the P19-P21 average of 325).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a recent stabilization at a lower baseline following a high-summer peak (approx. 482 units in Periods 16-18). Over the last three periods (P21-P23), demand averaged 372 units, suggesting a new support level. However, Period 24 (2019/7/22) shows a significant drop to 232 units (-37% vs the P21-P23 average), which mirrors the mid-summer volatility seen in late June. At late July (2019/7/29), we are entering the 'Back to School' transition period for denim. While P24 was low, high-waisted skinny jeans (Jade HW Skinny Denim) typically see a demand uptick as consumers prepare for the autumn season in August. The forecast anticipates a partial recovery from the P24 dip, moving back toward the 300-350 range, but remains cautious until the trend is confirmed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals a volatile demand pattern with periodic regime shifts. After a high-summer baseline of ~482 (P16-P18), demand shifted to a lower trading range averaging 372 (P21-P23). A sharp drop occurred in Period 24 (232), followed by a partial recovery in Period 25 (298). The current date (August 5) marks the beginning of the 'Back-to-School' (BTS) season, which is typically a high-demand period for the 'Divided' collection denim products. Given the upward momentum from P24 to P25 (+28%) and the expected seasonal tailwinds as school-prep shopping accelerates in early August, the forecast anticipates a return toward the previous baseline of ~370.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' SKU shows a clear recovery trend over the last three periods, moving from a low of 232 in Period 24 to 381 in Period 26. This upward momentum (+64% over two weeks) aligns with the mid-August 'Back-to-School' calendar window, a peak seasonal driver for the 'Divided' collection and denim products. Given the consistent growth of ~80 units per week recently and the historical evidence of high-summer demand peaks in the 450-530 range (Periods 16-18), a continued increase is projected for Period 27.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (232 to 381, +64%), signaling a seasonal recovery for denim products coinciding with the Back-to-School shopping period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is experiencing a strong seasonal recovery, consistent with the Back-to-School shopping period which is highly relevant for the 'Divided' youth collection and denim category. Historically, this SKU sees peaks around key retail events. Recent demand has shown four consecutive weeks of significant growth: 232 (P24), 298 (P25), 381 (P26), and 493 (P27). The week-over-week growth rate has accelerated from 28% to 29%. Given that August 19th is a primary peak week for Back-to-School preparations, I expect the upward momentum to continue, likely approaching the early-year peak levels (~670). I am forecasting a further increase to 615 units.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School surge confirmed: 4 consecutive periods of growth (232 to 493, +112% total), reaching the highest demand level since June and confirming a strong seasonal shift.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a clear 'Back-to-School' surge beginning in Period 24 (232 units) and peaking in Period 27 (493 units). Period 28 (432 units) indicates a slight cooling (-12%) from the peak, which is consistent with the end of the primary school shopping window as the calendar moves into late August (August 26). The current demand remains significantly higher than the July average (~312 units). Given the slight tapering observed in the most recent period, the forecast predicts a continued minor stabilization/softening as the peak season concludes, while remaining well above summer baseline levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant 'Back-to-School' surge that peaked in Period 27 (493 units) on August 12. Since that peak, demand has entered a cooling phase as the immediate seasonal rush subsides, moving from 493 to 432 (-12%) and then to 396 (-8%) in the most recent period. The current date (September 2) coincides with the actual start of the school term in many regions, which typically marks the end of the peak shopping window for wardrobe staples like skinny jeans. While demand remains higher than the mid-summer average of ~330, the downward trajectory is expected to continue as the market stabilizes into a standard autumn trading range. I project a further moderate decline to 370 units, reflecting the deceleration of the post-peak drop.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' saw a significant surge in Period 30 (740 units), marking the highest demand in the dataset. This spike coincides with the US Labor Day week (Sept 2, 2019), which traditionally serves as the peak of the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn shopping season for the 'Divided' collection. While the previous three periods (P27-P29) showed a strong upward trend averaging ~440 units, Period 30's 87% increase over Period 29 suggests a promotional or holiday-driven peak. Historically, demand tends to soften slightly in the week immediately following a major holiday peak (Period 31, Sept 9) as the initial school-start rush concludes. However, because denim is a core autumn staple, I expect demand to remain well above the August average but lower than the Labor Day peak. A forecast of 580 reflects a 20-25% correction from the holiday spike while maintaining the established autumn growth trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Autumn peak confirmed with a 112% increase over the summer average (from ~350 to 740), driven by Back-to-School and Labor Day seasonality.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 30 (Sept 2), where demand surged from a summer average of ~350 to over 700 units, coinciding with Labor Day and the peak Back-to-School season. For Period 32 (Sept 16), while the initial shopping surge is likely past its absolute peak, mid-September remains a high-demand period for denim as temperatures cool. Period 31 showed a slight cooling of 4% from the Period 30 peak (740 to 708). I expect this gradual tapering to continue while staying well above the summer baseline, resulting in a forecast slightly below Period 31.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has entered a new high-volume regime starting in early September (Period 30). This shift coincides with the Back-to-School and Labor Day retail peaks. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has shown remarkable stability, recording 740, 708, and 707 units respectively. This represents a significant increase from the August average of approximately 400 units. As of late September (2019/9/23), the immediate 'rush' of the holiday/school start has plateaued, but denim remains a high-demand seasonal staple for the autumn months. Given the extreme consistency between the last two periods (708 and 707), I expect demand to remain stable around the 700-unit mark for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: Demand has consolidated at a new high-level baseline, averaging 718 units over the last 3 periods (P30-P32), up ~80% from the previous summer trading range.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) experienced a massive surge in Period 33 (1428 units), doubling the previous Autumn baseline of ~718 units. This spike coincides with late September, a period often associated with mid-season promotions or the primary transition into cooler weather where denim demand peaks. Historically, such extreme spikes are rarely sustained at their peak level and are often followed by a corrective drop as immediate promotional demand is satisfied. However, given the product is a high-waisted denim trouser (highly relevant for the Autumn season), demand is expected to remain significantly higher than the pre-spike average of 718. I am forecasting a stabilization at a higher plateau, approximately midway between the previous baseline and the recent peak, to account for both the seasonal strength and the likely tapering of the Period 33 surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand surged to 1428 units (+100% vs previous 3-period average), signaling a potential peak-season acceleration or major promotional event. A new trading range significantly above the 700-unit mark is now evident.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has settled into a stable autumn regime following the Back-to-School surge. In September (Periods 30-32), demand averaged approximately 718 units. Period 33 saw a significant outlier spike to 1428 units (likely a promotion), but Period 34 demand returned to 748 units, which aligns closely with the established September baseline. For the current period (early October), there are no major retail drivers to suggest another spike. Therefore, the forecast assumes a continuation of the stable autumn trading range, slightly adjusted for the most recent observation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny denim) has shown high volatility recently. Following the Autumn peak established in early September (approx. 700-740 units) and a massive one-off spike in Period 33 (1428 units), demand has reverted and entered a downward trajectory. Period 34 (748 units) and Period 35 (606 units) indicate a cooling-off period following the primary Back-to-School/Early Autumn surge. As of October 14, we are in a shoulder season between the early fall peaks and the upcoming holiday promotions. Given the 19% drop observed in the last period, a further moderate decline is expected as demand settles into a mid-autumn baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge in late September (Period 33: 1428 units), followed by a return to the autumn baseline in Period 34 (748 units). Since then, demand has trended downward over the last two weeks, dropping from 606 to 581 units. Current date (Oct 21) is past the Back-to-School and initial Autumn peaks, entering a typically quieter pre-Holiday retail window for fashion. The recent data suggests a mean-reverting trend towards the 550-600 unit range. I forecast a slight continued softening of demand to 565, consistent with the observed downward trend from the 700+ baseline seen in early October.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak decline: Demand has decreased for 3 consecutive periods (748 to 581, -22%), indicating the end of the high-autumn trading regime (700+) and a shift to a lower pre-holiday baseline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the extreme demand spike in Period 33 (1428 units), demand underwent a three-period decline (748, 606, 581) as the autumn peak subsided. Period 37 shows the first sign of stabilization/recovery with demand increasing to 643 (+10.6% vs P36). As the current date (2019/10/28) approaches the transition into November, a month typically characterized by early holiday promotions and seasonal denim demand, I anticipate the demand will remain stable or slightly increase from the current baseline. The forecast weights the last three periods (averaging 610 units) while accounting for the recent upward turn in Period 37.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the post-autumn peak decline, demand has stabilized over the last 3 periods (P35-P37) at a new baseline averaging 610 units, approximately 15% below the high-autumn regime but significantly above summer levels.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a post-autumn peak stabilization in the 600-650 range. Recent demand has increased for two consecutive periods (581 to 643 to 663), indicating a modest upward trend as we enter early November. This period (Nov 4) typically marks the beginning of the pre-holiday shopping buildup, specifically preceding events like Singles' Day (11/11) and Black Friday. Given the 3-period upward trajectory and the seasonal calendar, a continued moderate increase is expected as consumers transition into winter shopping.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has recently stabilized at a baseline of approximately 610-630 units (Periods 35-38) following the Autumn peak. Although Period 39 saw a significant drop to 485 units (-21% vs. the recent average), this period immediately precedes the week of November 11th. Since Period 40 coincides with the Single's Day (11/11) retail event, a strong recovery from the Period 39 dip is anticipated. The forecast assumes a return to the established pre-holiday baseline with a slight promotional lift, placing the predicted demand back in the 650-670 range.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that after the autumn peak in late September (P33: 1428 units), demand stabilized in the 600-unit range. Recently (P35-P40), demand has averaged 593 units. The most recent data point (P40: 581) and the previous (P39: 485) show some volatility, but the overall trend remains steady in the high 500s. As Period 41 starts on Nov 18, we are in the week immediately preceding Black Friday. Typically, demand remains stable or increases slightly as pre-holiday shopping begins, though the major surge is expected in the following period. Based on the 3-period average of 576 and the seasonal positioning, a forecast of 605 is projected, reflecting a slight upward movement towards the established autumn baseline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) has stabilized at a lower baseline averaging approximately 538 units, compared to the previous pre-holiday baseline of ~610 units. However, Period 42 (starting 2019/11/25) encompasses the Black Friday retail event (Nov 29, 2019). Historical data for this SKU shows a high sensitivity to promotional events, notably Period 33 where demand surged by 100% relative to its then-baseline. Given that skinny denim in the Divided collection is a high-volume category frequently discounted during Black Friday, a significant demand spike is anticipated. Applying a multiplier similar to the Period 33 event (+100% over current baseline) suggests a forecast in the 1000-1100 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand baseline shift at Period 39: Demand has transitioned to a lower pre-holiday trading range, averaging 538 units over the last 3 periods (-12% vs the P35-37 average).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive surge to 3100 units (+466% vs. the previous 3-period average), which corresponds directly to Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019. Historically, the week immediately following these major promotional events (Dec 2) typically experiences a sharp regression toward the mean as promotional activity subsides. Prior to this event, the demand had established a stable pre-holiday baseline of approximately 538 units (Periods 39-41). While December generally maintains higher seasonal traffic than early November for apparel, the 'pull-forward' effect of a massive spike like the one seen in P42 often leads to a temporary dip. Therefore, I am forecasting a return to the pre-holiday baseline, adjusted slightly for typical December retail momentum.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 showed a ~5.7x increase over the previous baseline (3100 vs 538), establishing the peak promotional magnitude for this SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a massive peak in Period 42 (3100 units) corresponding to Black Friday week. Period 43 (674 units) shows a significant drop as the primary promotional event concluded, though demand remains approximately 25% higher than the pre-holiday baseline of Period 39-41 (avg: 538). For Period 44 (Dec 9), we anticipate demand will continue to stabilize as the immediate surge from Cyber Monday (early P43) fades, while still benefiting from general holiday shopping traffic. A slight downward adjustment from the post-promo high of 674 is expected, settling into a December trading range higher than the November baseline but lower than the promotional peaks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the Black Friday spike (P42: 3100 units), demand has returned to a stable baseline. In the two periods since (P43 and P44), demand has been remarkably consistent at 674 and 680 units, respectively. This level is approximately 26% higher than the pre-Black Friday November average (~538 units), likely due to increased holiday shopping traffic in December. The current period (Dec 16) represents the final full week of shopping before Christmas. Given the stability of the last two weeks, I expect demand to remain at this holiday-elevated baseline, with a slight uptick for the peak holiday rush.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has remained highly stable over the last three periods (P43-P45), averaging 670 units (674, 680, 657). This follows the significant Black Friday spike in Period 42. Period 46 (Dec 23 - Dec 29) encompasses Christmas and the start of post-Christmas clearance sales. While the first half of the week (Dec 23-25) typically sees a lull in standard retail for non-gift items, the 'Divided' collection (younger demographic) usually experiences a surge starting Dec 26 due to gift card redemptions and end-of-year promotions. Given the stable baseline of ~670 and the anticipated post-Christmas shopping activity, I forecast a moderate increase to 715 units, reflecting the seasonal shift into clearance/winter sale activity.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stability confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a new baseline of approximately 670 units over the last 3 periods (P43-P45), representing a ~25% increase over the pre-holiday baseline of 538 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (superstretch skinny jeans) has recently transitioned from a stable post-Black Friday baseline of ~670 units (Periods 43-45) to a holiday-week low of 475 units in Period 46 (a 28% decrease). This drop is consistent with retail trends during the week of Christmas. Period 47 (starting 2019/12/30) covers the New Year's transition and the start of post-holiday clearance sales. Historically, demand typically begins a recovery from the Christmas trough as consumers utilize gift cards and retailers clear winter inventory. Given the product's high-waisted skinny denim nature, it remains a staple. I anticipate a partial recovery from the Period 46 low, though demand is unlikely to return fully to the ~670 pre-holiday baseline immediately.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand contraction: Period 46 demand dropped 28% (from 657 to 475), signaling the expected seasonal trough during the Christmas week following the post-Black Friday stabilization at ~670 units.

Predicted demand: 555 units
