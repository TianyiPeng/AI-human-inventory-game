======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last five periods shows a steady upward trend [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is Feb 11, 2019. In the retail fashion sector, this period coincides with the lead-up to the Spring season and often sees increased interest in 'Skinny Denim' as customers transition out of heavy winter wear. 3. Trend Analysis: Following a dip in the second period, demand has grown consistently for three consecutive periods, with the most recent jump from 715 to 774 (+8%). 4. Logic: Given the clear upward momentum and the seasonal shift towards spring apparel, I anticipate a continued slight increase for the next period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical Pattern: The training data shows a mean of 688.8 units with an upward trend peaking at 774 units. (2) Seasonal/Calendar: The current period (Feb 18, 2019) follows the Period 1 demand of 671. This time of year often sees stable demand for core denim items (high-waisted skinny jeans) as part of the early spring transition. No major shopping holidays are immediately present, but the 'Divided' collection targets a demographic prone to steady replenishment. (3) Recent Trend: Period 1 (671) is slightly below the training average but aligns with the earlier training data points (694, 685). (4) Final Forecast Logic: Given the relative stability and the slight dip from the training peak of 774 back to 671, I expect demand to remain within the 670-700 range. I will forecast a slight recovery towards the historical mean.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The training data shows a generally upward movement (694 to 774) with a mean of 688.8 units. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The current date is Feb 25, 2019. This is late winter transitioning into early spring. 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is a staple item, but high-waisted jeans often see increased interest during the spring transition. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: Recent observations for Period 1 (671) and Period 2 (673) show a slight decrease from the training average but represent very stable, flat demand over the last two weeks. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the extreme stability between Period 1 and Period 2 (a difference of only 2 units), I expect the demand to remain steady or show a very slight uptick as the spring shopping season approaches in March. I will forecast a value consistent with the recent stable baseline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data showed strong demand averaging 688 units (range 576-774). 2. Recent Performance: Period 1 (671) and Period 2 (673) remained stable and consistent with the mean. Period 3 (539) showed a notable dip of ~20%. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. This product is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' trouser, which is a core fashion staple. Early March often sees a transition toward spring collections, but standard denim remains relevant. 4. Forecast Logic: The dip in Period 3 may be a minor fluctuation rather than a regime shift. However, weighting the recent decline slightly while acknowledging the strong baseline, a recovery toward the historical average is expected as March shopping typically picks up. Forecast is set at 615 to account for a partial rebound from the Period 3 low.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 706016001 showed an initial stable range (approx. 670-700 units) but has experienced a significant decline over the last two weeks, dropping from 673 to 539 (-20%) and then to 447 (-17%). The current date (March 11) is moving further into the spring season; while high-waisted skinny jeans are generally year-round items, the recent trend suggests a cooling of interest or a shift in consumer preference within the Divided collection. Given the 17% drop in the most recent period, I anticipate the downward momentum to continue but at a slightly decelerated rate as it approaches a potential new floor.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend detected: demand decreased from an average of ~670 in Periods 1-2 to ~493 in Periods 3-4 (approx. 26% decline).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial stable demand around 672 units in Periods 1-2, followed by a significant drop in Periods 3-5. The average demand for the last three periods (3-5) is approximately 485 units. Period 5 (468 units) shows a slight stabilization compared to Period 4 (447 units), suggesting the downward trend may be leveling off. The current date (2019/3/18) is in early spring; as a high-waisted 'superstretch' skinny denim item, it remains seasonally relevant, but there are no major retail holidays or events in this specific week to drive a spike. Given the recent stabilization between Periods 4 and 5, I expect demand to remain consistent with the new lower regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis: The training data showed high demand (avg ~689), but recent test data from Periods 1-6 indicates a distinct downward shift followed by a stabilization. Specifically, Periods 1-2 averaged ~672, then demand dropped significantly in Periods 3-4 (avg ~493). Current trend: In the last two periods (5 and 6), demand has shown a slight recovery/stabilization (468 to 502), increasing by ~7%. Seasonal/Calendar: Period 7 (2019/3/25) occurs during the spring fashion season. High-waisted denim is a staple item that typically sees steady interest in late March as weather warms. Forecast logic: Given the slight upward momentum in the last two periods and the seasonal relevance of the product, I expect a small continued increase from Period 6's 502 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand started high in Feb (avg ~672) but dropped significantly in early March (avg ~493), leading to the insight recorded in Period 5. However, since Period 4, there has been a consistent, albeit gradual, recovery in demand (447 -> 468 -> 502 -> 511). This upward movement coincides with the onset of Spring in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically increases demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' as customers update their seasonal wardrobes. For Period 8 (April 1st), we are entering the peak spring shopping window. Given the three-period upward trajectory and the start of a new month (April), I expect the demand to continue its modest growth trend toward the previous mean, though it likely won't hit the Feb highs immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods from a low of 447 (Period 4) to 511 (Period 7), showing a ~14% recovery as Spring begins.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) started high (~670), dropped significantly in early March (~447-468), and has since shown a consistent recovery trend over the last four periods (468 -> 502 -> 511 -> 560). The current date is April 8th, entering the peak spring fashion season. Skinny denim is a staple item that typically sees increased demand as weather warms and consumers update their spring wardrobes. The previous period (P8) showed a significant jump of nearly 10% (511 to 560). Given the sustained upward momentum (+25% since the Period 4 trough) and the seasonal timing, I expect the demand to continue its upward trajectory towards the 600-unit level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward trend confirmed: Demand has increased for five consecutive periods from 447 (P4) to 560 (P8), representing a ~25% growth as peak spring season begins.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (High-waisted skinny jeans) showed a strong recovery trend from Period 4 (447) to Period 8 (560). However, Period 9 saw a significant and sharp drop to 335 units. Analysis of the current date (April 15, 2019) suggests this drop is likely a temporary anomaly rather than a regime shift, potentially due to the timing of the Easter holiday (April 21, 2019) where retail demand often dips immediately before a holiday weekend or due to specific local market fluctuations. Skinny denim is a staple product with high seasonal relevance in mid-spring. Given the prior upward trend that reached 560 and the fact that one period of decline (Period 9) does not yet constitute a 'sustained' downward trend according to the guidelines, I expect demand to mean-revert toward the recent recovery average while acknowledging the volatility. I am forecasting a partial recovery from the Period 9 dip, positioning the estimate between the recent low and the previous growth trajectory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has experienced a significant reversal. After a sustained recovery peaking at 560 units in Period 8, demand dropped sharply in Period 9 (335) and Period 10 (269). This decline coincide with the weeks leading up to and including Easter (April 21, 2019), suggesting a post-spring-peak correction or a shift in consumer focus. The rate of decline slowed from 40% (P8 to P9) to approximately 20% (P9 to P10). For Period 11 (starting April 22), I anticipate the demand will begin to stabilize as the post-holiday slump bottoms out, though it remains in a downward trajectory relative to the previous month.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU showed an initial decline from ~670 (P1-2) to ~450 (P4), followed by a recovery peaking at 560 (P8). However, starting from Period 9 (2019/4/08), demand has undergone a significant regime shift, dropping sharply and stabilizing at a much lower level (P9: 335, P10: 269, P11: 261). The current date is April 29, 2019. This drop likely represents a seasonal transition away from this specific 'Jade HW Skinny' style or a post-spring-peak cooling. The last two periods (P10 and P11) show stability around the 260-270 range. Given the stabilization over the last two weeks, I expect demand for Period 12 to remain consistent with this new lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 11: Demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower mean of ~288 over the last 3 periods (P9-P11), a 48% decrease from the previous peak of 560.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant drop in demand after Period 8 (peak spring), with a regime shift identified at Period 11 where demand stabilized around a mean of 288. However, the most recent observation (Period 12: 339 units) shows a 30% increase from the previous week (Period 11: 261 units). Date-wise, we are moving into early May (2019/5/6). For a product like 'High-waisted skinny jeans' in the 'Divided' collection (targeting younger consumers), early May often sees a modest bump due to late spring shopping and transition to warmer weather before the peak summer lull. The historical mean for P9-P11 was 288, but P12 at 339 suggests a slight upward correction or stabilization at a higher level than the April lows. I forecast a slight continuation of this stabilization/recovery, leaning toward the recent average and the P12 momentum.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a high initial period (~670), followed by a spring recovery peak (560 in P8), and a subsequent sharp decline. The carry-over insight for Period 12 noted a regime shift to a lower mean of ~288. Recent demand for Periods 10-13 (269, 261, 339, 241) confirms this lower stabilized range, with an average of approximately 277 units. The specific drop in Period 13 (241) suggests continued weakness as we move further into May, where heavy denim trousers ('Jade HW Skinny Denim') typically face seasonal headwinds compared to lighter spring/summer attire. Given the recent fluctuation around the 240-340 range with a downward lean in the most recent observation, the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization near the recent low.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a significant downward trajectory. After an early peak in February (~670), demand underwent a regime shift in mid-April (P9-P11) dropping to ~288. Most recently, the last two periods (P13-P14) show a further decline from 339 to 241 and then 189, suggesting the previous 'stabilized' mean is no longer holding. The current date (May 20) is moving deeper into late spring/early summer, where full-length skinny denim often sees reduced demand in favor of lighter seasonal wear. The demand has dropped by ~21% in the most recent week. I expect the downward trend to continue, though perhaps at a slightly decelerating rate as it approaches a potential floor.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend continuation: Demand has dropped for two consecutive periods below the previously established regime of ~288, reaching a new low of 189 in Period 14 (a ~34% decrease from the P12 level).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has been highly volatile in recent weeks. After a significant downward trend that reached a low of 189 units in Period 14, Period 15 saw a sharp increase to 375 units (a 98% increase). This spike aligns with the lead-up to Memorial Day (May 27th), a major retail event. Historically, this product (high-waisted skinny jeans) saw much higher demand (600-700s) earlier in the year, but has since stabilized in a lower regime. Given the current date is the Memorial Day holiday itself, demand is expected to remain elevated compared to the early May lows, though it may see a slight cooling from the immediate pre-holiday peak seen in Period 15. The forecast weights the recent recovery and holiday impact against the established lower mean of the last 7 periods (~287).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a highly volatile demand pattern for these skinny jeans. After a period of decline reaching a low of 189 in Period 14, demand has surged significantly over the last two weeks: 375 in Period 15 (+98%) and 533 in Period 16 (+42%). This recovery aligns with the transition into the early summer retail season (early June), where apparel demand often increases. The current demand level (533) is now approaching the previous peak observed in Period 8 (560). Given the strong upward momentum of +150 to +180 units per week, I anticipate a further increase as the trend stabilizes near the upper historical bounds of ~600-670 units. I forecast a demand of 610, continuing the upward trajectory but at a slightly decelerated rate as it nears previous resistance levels.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 has shown a significant recovery over the last three periods (P15-P17), breaking away from the low-demand regime observed in May. Recent demand levels of 375, 533, and 451 result in a three-period average of approximately 453, which is a 74% increase over the previous five-period average (~260). While Period 17 (451) showed a slight decrease from the Period 16 peak (533), the overall volume remains substantially higher than early Q2 levels. This suggests a new demand level as we enter the summer season. The forecast for Period 18 anticipates demand stabilizing around this new higher mean, accounting for the slight downward momentum from P16 to P17.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: Demand has increased and stabilized at a higher mean of ~453 over the last 3 periods (P15-P17), representing a ~74% increase from the previous May low-point average of ~260.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 706016001 has transitioned from a low-point in May (averaging ~260) to a significantly higher and more stable regime in June. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has been 533, 451, and 462 respectively. The last two periods (451 and 462) indicate a stabilization in the mid-450s. As we are in mid-June, a period generally characterized by consistent summer retail activity for core denim items, I expect the demand to remain within this established band. The forecast uses the recent two-week average (~457) as a baseline, anticipating a slight continued momentum from the previous week's minor uptick.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim has shown significant volatility. After a confirmed upward regime shift (P15-P17) with an average of ~453, demand remained steady in P18 (462) but experienced a notable drop in P19 (358), a decline of ~22%. Given the current date of June 24, we are in the peak of summer, which typically sees reduced demand for full-length heavy denim as consumers favor lighter seasonal apparel. The drop in P19 likely reflects this seasonal cooling. My forecast anticipates a slight further softening or stabilization at this lower level as summer continues.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has shown significant volatility throughout the test period. Following a recovery peak in early June (P18: 462), demand has entered a sharp downward trajectory over the last three periods: 462 -> 358 -> 265. This represents a ~43% decline in three weeks. Seasonally, the transition into July marks the peak of summer, which typically sees reduced demand for heavy denim as consumers favor lighter garments. Given the consistent weekly drop of approximately 90-100 units and the historical low seen in mid-May (P14: 189), I expect demand to continue its descent toward that floor but with a slight deceleration in the rate of decline.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed at Period 21: Demand has decreased for three consecutive periods from 462 (P18) to 265 (P20), a ~43% decline likely driven by seasonal shifts into peak summer heat.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' shows high volatility. After a peak in early June (P18: 462), demand dropped significantly towards the end of June (P20: 265). However, the most recent observation (P21: 353) shows a recovery. July 8th typically aligns with mid-summer retail activity and potential summer sale periods. Given that the product is a denim staple, demand appears to be stabilizing in a new range. The average of the last three periods (P19-P21) is 325, and the bounce in P21 suggests the downward trend noted in previous insights has slowed. I forecast a slight stabilization around the mean of the most recent volatile window.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim jeans item, which typically sees fluctuating demand in summer but gains momentum toward the Back-to-School season starting in mid-to-late July. Recent demand data shows a recovery from a low of 265 (Period 20) to 353 (Period 21) and 393 (Period 22). This represents two consecutive periods of growth (+33% and +11% respectively), suggesting the 'peak summer heat' decline mentioned in the previous carry-over insight has ended. Given the historical trend of jeans demand increasing as autumn approaches and the current upward momentum, I expect demand to continue its gradual rise toward the previous regime average of ~450. Therefore, I forecast a continued increase for Period 23.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has entered a stabilization phase following a period of decline. After a sharp drop to 265 units in Period 20, demand recovered and has stabilized over the last three periods (P21: 353, P22: 393, P23: 369) with an average of approximately 372 units. Seasonally, mid-to-late July (Current Date: 2019/7/22) typically precedes the 'Back-to-School' transition, where demand for core denim items often remains steady or begins a slight upward climb before the August peak. Given the recent three-period stability and the slight dip from P22 to P23, the forecast anticipates demand to remain consistent with the current short-term mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed at Period 23: Following the mid-summer low in P20, demand has stabilized at a new mean of ~372 over the last 3 periods (P21-P23), representing a recovery from the previous trough.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS has shown significant volatility throughout the summer. After a period of relative stability between Period 21 and 23 (averaging ~372 units), Period 24 saw a sharp decline to 232 units (-37%). This drop mirrors the previous low seen in Period 20 (265 units). As we move into late July and early August (Period 25), we enter the start of the 'Back-to-School' shopping season, which typically favors denim staples like skinny jeans. While the drop in Period 24 is significant, the transition into August often signals a demand recovery for this product category. Therefore, the forecast predicts a moderate rebound from the Period 24 low, trending back toward the 300-unit level as seasonal interest begins to pick up.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) showed a significant dip in Period 24 (232 units) but began a recovery in Period 25 (298 units), an increase of 28% week-over-week. Historically, early August (Period 26, starting Aug 5) marks the beginning of the 'Back-to-School' and 'Pre-Fall' retail season, where denim products typically see a surge in demand as consumers prepare for cooler weather. Although the last five periods averaged 329 units, the recent momentum combined with the seasonal transition suggests a continued upward trajectory. I expect demand to return toward the previous stabilization mean of ~370 identified in Period 24's insights, adjusted for the seasonal uptick.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS is currently in an upward trend. Over the last three periods (P24-P26), demand has risen from 232 to 381 units. This recovery coincides with the start of the August 'Back-to-School' retail window, which typically drives higher demand for denim and trousers. The increase between P25 (298) and P26 (381) was approximately 28%. Given the seasonal timing (mid-August) and the consistent upward momentum over three weeks, I expect demand to continue increasing as the peak shopping season approaches. I am forecasting a continued growth trend towards the 450-unit level seen during previous peaks in June.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend confirmed at Period 26: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods from 232 (P24) to 381 (P26), representing a ~64% increase likely driven by the start of the Back-to-School season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim) is currently in a strong upward trend, having increased for four consecutive periods from 232 (P24) to 493 (P27). This surge is strongly correlated with the peak Back-to-School shopping season (mid-to-late August), where denim is a staple category. Historically, the product has seen highs around 670 in February and 533 in May. Given the current momentum\u2014an increase of 83 units followed by 112 units\u2014demand is expected to continue rising as we approach the final weeks before the start of the academic year. The forecast of 585 anticipates a slightly decelerating but still significant growth as demand moves toward the higher historical levels seen at the beginning of the year.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a significant upward trajectory since late July (Period 24), coinciding with the Back-to-School (BTS) retail season. Demand peaked at 493 units in Period 27 before a slight cooling to 432 units in Period 28. Historically, skinny jeans see strong, sustained demand throughout late August as the school year begins. The average demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) is approximately 435 units, which is a 17% increase over the previous July stabilization mean of 372. For Period 29 (August 26), I expect demand to remain elevated near this new mean, reflecting the final surge of late-summer denim shopping, though potentially tapering slightly from the absolute peak seen in mid-August.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 28: Average demand has increased to ~435 over the last 3 periods (P26-P28), a 17% increase from the previous stable mean of 372, driven by the Back-to-School season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS reached a seasonal peak in Period 27 (493 units) during the height of the Back-to-School season. Since that peak, demand has shown a steady decline as the initial shopping surge tapers off: Period 28 (432) and Period 29 (396). This represents a decline of approximately 12% and 8% respectively. As of September 2nd (Period 30), the immediate Back-to-School rush is likely ending, although denim remains a relevant fall product. Given the deceleration of the decline (from -61 units to -36 units), I expect demand to continue its downward trajectory but at a slightly slower rate, stabilizing as it moves away from the peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major demand spike in Period 30 (740 units), which aligns with the Labor Day holiday week (Sept 2, 2019) and the culmination of the Back-to-School shopping season. While high-waisted skinny jeans are a primary fall fashion staple, historical patterns after previous peaks (e.g., P8 to P9 and P16 to P17) indicate a consistent immediate post-event cooling period. The previous regime mean (P26-P29) was approximately 425 units. Although Period 31 demand is expected to drop significantly from the holiday peak of 740, the transition into full autumn should keep demand slightly higher than the preceding August average. I am forecasting a regression toward a slightly elevated post-holiday mean of 465.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 30 (740 units) confirmed: Corresponds with Labor Day holiday, marking the highest volume in the dataset to date and validating the peak of the Back-to-School season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) has experienced a significant surge over the last two periods, coinciding with the peak Back-to-School season and the Labor Day holiday. After jumping from an average of ~435 (P26-P28) to 740 (P30), demand remained very high at 708 in P31. This suggests a transition into a high-demand fall regime, similar to the levels seen at the start of the data (P1-P2). However, as we move into mid-September (9/16), the initial school-start rush typically begins to cool slightly. I anticipate a minor decline from the P30-P31 peak while maintaining strong volume relative to the summer months, reflecting sustained fall denim shopping.

Over the last three weeks (P30-P32), demand has stabilized at an average of ~718 units (740, 708, 707), which is a 65% increase over the previous late-August mean of ~435. This sustained peak aligns with the transition into the Fall season and the continuation of Back-to-School shopping. Given the near-identical demand in the last two periods (708 vs 707), the forecast assumes this plateau will persist into late September.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 32: Average demand increased to ~718 over the last 3 periods (P30-P32), a ~65% increase from the previous mean of 435, marking the Fall/Back-to-School peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has shown a massive spike in the most recent period (P33: 1428 units), more than doubling the already high Fall/Back-to-School regime of ~718 units observed from P30-P32. This surge likely corresponds to a late-September marketing event, payday weekend, or a sharp seasonal shift as cooler weather drives denim sales. While the 1428 value is likely a peak event, historical trends suggest demand will remain elevated throughout the Fall season. A moderate correction from the extreme P33 peak is expected as the initial surge of the promotion or seasonal transition stabilizes, but the forecast remains significantly higher than the previous 700-unit baseline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has entered a significantly higher regime since the start of September (Period 30), coinciding with the Fall/Back-to-School season. While Period 33 experienced a massive outlier spike to 1428 units (likely due to a specific promotion or pay-day event), Period 34 returned to the established regime level with 748 units. Excluding the Period 33 spike, the recent mean since Period 30 (740, 708, 707, 748) is approximately 726 units. As we move into October, demand for denim typically remains strong as a staple fall garment, though the initial seasonal surge may begin to level off. Therefore, the forecast for Period 35 is based on the stabilized mean of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand outlier recorded at Period 33 (1428 units), representing a 100% increase over the current regime mean of ~718; however, Period 34 confirmed a return to the previous stable high-demand level (~748).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' reached a high-demand regime in September (P30-P34), averaging ~725 units (excluding the P33 outlier of 1428). However, Period 35 shows a notable decrease to 606 units, suggesting a cooling off from the peak Back-to-School/Early Fall surge. Given the date (October 14th), demand often stabilizes or slightly declines before the pre-holiday build-up. I expect the demand to remain near the Period 35 level as the initial seasonal peak concludes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 is currently in a post-peak decline phase following the high-volume 'Back-to-School/Early Fall' period (P30-P34). After an outlier spike in P33 (1428) and a return to the peak level in P34 (748), demand has decreased for two consecutive periods: P35 (606) and P36 (581). This indicates a cooling trend as the initial autumn wardrobe surge subsides. The rate of decline slowed significantly between P35 and P36 (-4%), suggesting the demand is approaching a new, lower stabilization point for late October. My forecast for P37 predicts a continued slight decrease to account for this seasonal deceleration.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a significant peak during September (Periods 30-34), followed by a slight cooling in October. The most recent three periods (P35: 606, P36: 581, P37: 643) indicate a stabilization at a new mean of approximately 610 units. This level is ~16% lower than the September peak (avg ~725) but remains substantially higher than the summer baseline, reflecting sustained seasonal demand for high-waisted denim in late autumn. Given the recent slight uptick in Period 37 and the product's relevance as a cold-weather staple, I anticipate demand will remain consistent with the current three-period average.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 37: Average demand has stabilized at ~610 over the last 3 periods (P35-P37), a ~16% decrease from the high-demand peak of ~725 observed in September (P30-P34).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim) has shown a steady upward trend over the last three periods (581, 643, 663) following the post-September stabilization. This growth aligns with the seasonal transition into November, where denim typically performs well as weather cools and retailers prepare for holiday shopping. The mean of the most recent three periods is approximately 629, but the directional trend is clearly positive (+10.7% from P36 to P37 and +3.1% from P37 to P38). For Period 39, I expect the demand to continue this moderate upward trajectory as the market approaches the mid-November pre-holiday peak, likely landing in the 680-700 range.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for SKU 706016001 showed a stable regime throughout October (P35-P38) with an average of approximately 623 units. However, Period 39 (Nov 4) showed a significant 26% decrease to 485 units. This drop likely marks a seasonal 'lull' in early November as consumers anticipate major late-month shopping events like Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019). Period 40 (Nov 11) coincides with Singles' Day, which may provide a minor lift or stabilization compared to the previous week's dip, but is unlikely to return to the September/October peak levels yet. My forecast anticipates a slight stabilization around the 500-unit mark before the late November holiday surge.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a high-demand peak in September (P30-P34 ~700-750) followed by a stabilization in October (P35-P37 ~610). Recent weeks (P38-P40) have shown increased volatility: a peak of 663 (P38) followed by a dip to 485 (P39) and a recovery to 581 (P40). The average demand over the last six periods (P35-P40) is approximately 593. As Period 41 (starting Nov 18) precedes the Black Friday week in 2019, retail demand typically sees a moderate uptick from early-season promotions and holiday shopping commencement. Given the recent recovery from P39 to P40 and the seasonal timing, I forecast a return towards the mid-November average, slightly weighted by the impending holiday peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' shows clear seasonality, with peaks during Back-to-School (Period 30-34, avg ~730) and a recent stabilization at a lower mean (P39-P41, avg ~538). Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with the week of Thanksgiving and Black Friday (Nov 29), which is a major retail event likely to drive a significant demand spike for a staple apparel item like skinny jeans. Based on the previous major promotional event (Labor Day, Period 30) where demand jumped ~85% from its baseline, a substantial increase is expected. Given the current baseline of ~540, a conservative yet significant holiday uplift of approximately 60-70% is applied to account for the Black Friday surge.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend detected since Period 39: Average demand decreased to ~538 over the last 3 periods (P39-P41), a ~12% decline from the previous regime mean of ~610.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 (3100 units) represents a massive outlier (+476% vs. previous 3-period average) corresponding to the Black Friday promotional week. Historically, following significant spikes (e.g., Period 33), demand tends to revert toward the established baseline. For Period 43 (starting Dec 2, 2019), which includes Cyber Monday, demand is expected to remain slightly elevated compared to the pre-holiday baseline of ~538 but will drop sharply from the Black Friday peak. I forecast a return to the upper end of the recent stable range (~600-700 units) as the extreme promotional intensity of Black Friday subsides, while still accounting for Cyber Monday and early December holiday shopping.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 43 (674) showed a strong recovery post-Black Friday, driven by Cyber Monday (Dec 2) and the onset of the holiday shopping season. Period 42 (3100) was a massive outlier corresponding to Black Friday week. Excluding this outlier, the baseline demand leading into the holidays (P39-P41) averaged ~538. The jump to 674 in P43 indicates a sustained holiday lift. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to remain elevated but slightly stabilize compared to the Cyber Monday peak, following the trend seen in previous seasonal transitions where demand maintains a higher plateau before the year-end peak. I am forecasting a slight moderation from the P43 peak while remaining above the November baseline.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand outlier at Period 42 (3100 units) confirmed: Black Friday event drove a ~475% increase over the previous regime mean (~538). Period 43 (674 units) confirms a new holiday-season baseline that is ~25% higher than the pre-holiday November average.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the Black Friday outlier (Period 42), demand has settled into a new holiday-season baseline. Observations from Period 43 (674) and Period 44 (680) show high stability. The current date of 2019/12/16 represents the peak shopping week before Christmas. Given the consistent performance over the last two weeks and the seasonal pressure of the late holiday window, demand is expected to remain high and potentially show a slight increase as consumers finalize winter wardrobe and gift purchases.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has stabilized at a remarkably consistent holiday baseline, with values of 674, 680, and 657 units respectively (averaging ~670). This represents a sustained ~25% increase over the pre-holiday November average (~538), as previously identified. Current Period 46 (Dec 23\u201329) encompasses Christmas Day. While the holiday may lead to a brief closure/lull on the 25th, the surrounding days (last-minute shopping and post-Christmas clearance/self-gifting) typically sustain apparel demand. Given the high stability of the current regime, the forecast remains near the established mean of 670, with a slight downward adjustment to 650 to account for the potential mid-week holiday dip.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: Following the Black Friday spike, demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~670 over the last three periods (P43-P45), reflecting a 25% increase from the November baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a stable holiday demand regime of ~670 units (P43-P45) following the Black Friday outlier. Period 46 (Dec 23) saw a significant 28% drop to 475 units, aligning with the typical retail slowdown during the Christmas week. Period 47 (Dec 30) encompasses New Year's Eve and the immediate post-holiday period, which historically experiences lower foot traffic and a cooling of consumer spending after the peak gift-giving season. Given that P46 represents the start of this seasonal dip, I expect demand for Period 47 to remain suppressed near the P46 level as the market transitions out of the high-demand holiday regime and back toward early-year baselines.
