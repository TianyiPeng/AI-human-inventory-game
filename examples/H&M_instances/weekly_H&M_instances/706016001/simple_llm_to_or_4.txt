Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS over the last five periods shows a fluctuating but generally upward trend: [694, 576, 685, 715, 774]. The average demand over this period is 688 units. The current date is February 11, 2019. In the retail fashion world, mid-February often marks the transition from winter clearances into spring collection interest, and specifically for 'Divided' (H&M's youth line), there is often a pre-spring lift. The most recent demand point (774) is significantly above the mean, indicating momentum. Given the steady increase over the last three periods (685 -> 715 -> 774), I anticipate the demand will remain elevated or slightly increase as spring shopping begins to ramp up. I will forecast a slight continuation of the current upward momentum.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the training period averaged approximately 689 units (694, 576, 685, 715, 774). The most recent observed demand for Period 1 (Feb 11, 2019) was 671 units, which aligns closely with this historical mean. The product is 'High-waisted skinny denim,' a staple item with relatively stable year-round demand, though often seeing a slight uptick during the spring transition. Given the consistency between the training data and the most recent observation, and the absence of major short-term calendar shocks for the week of Feb 18, I expect demand to remain stable near the established baseline. I will project a slight increase to account for the slight upward trend seen in the latter half of the training data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) shows a stable baseline with training data averaging 688.8 units and the first two test periods showing 671 and 673 units respectively. The product is a staple item (high-waisted skinny jeans) in the 'Divided' collection, suggesting consistent year-round demand with slight variations. The period starting 2019/02/25 represents the transition from late winter to early spring, which typically sees a moderate uptick in fashion retail as consumers refresh their wardrobes. Given the stability of the recent demand (variance of only 2 units between Period 1 and 2), I anticipate a very slight increase or maintenance of the current level, slightly regressing towards the historical mean of 689.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a mean baseline of approximately 680-700 units (training data avg: 688, initial test periods 1-2 avg: 672). Period 3 (starting 2019/02/25) shows a notable dip to 539 units, likely reflecting the month-end transition before early March. The current period (Period 4, starting 2019/03/04) enters the spring fashion season where 'High-waisted skinny denim' typically sees renewed demand. Historically, after a dip below 600, demand for this everyday staple tends to mean-revert as pay cycles reset and spring shopping begins. I expect a recovery from the Period 3 low toward the historical mean, adjusting for the recent dip.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows an initial stability around 670-700 units (Periods 1-2) followed by a sharp downward trend in Periods 3 and 4, dropping from 673 to 539 (-20%) and then to 447 (-17%). This period (March 11) is typically a transition phase for spring fashion; however, the recent 2-week momentum is strongly negative. The forecast assumes the rate of decline will decelerate as it approaches a potential floor, adjusting the previous drop of ~90 units to a more conservative reduction, landing at approximately 415 units.

Carry-over insight: Significant downward demand shift detected starting Period 3: demand dropped from an average of ~670 to ~490 over the last two periods (~27% decrease).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial high demand phase (Periods 1-2) with an average of 672 units, followed by a sharp decline starting in Period 3. Periods 4 and 5 indicate a stabilization into a lower demand regime, averaging 457.5 units. The product is a staple item (High-waisted skinny denim), and the current date (March 18) is well into the spring season without immediate major shopping holidays that would trigger a spike. The trend shows a slight recovery in Period 5 (468) vs Period 4 (447), suggesting the downward slide has bottomed out. I expect demand to remain within this new lower regime (~450-480) for the current period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial high demand phase (avg 672 units) followed by a significant drop starting Period 3. For the last three periods (Periods 4-6), the demand has stabilized at a lower level with a slight upward crawl: 447, 468, and 502 units (mean ~472). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', a staple wardrobe item. The current date is March 25, 2019. In the retail calendar, late March often sees a 'Spring Break' or 'Spring Refresh' lift as customers update their wardrobes for warmer weather. The recent trend shows a modest recovery (+4.7% then +7.2%). I expect this gradual recovery to continue as we enter peak Spring shopping weeks, following the established 'lower regime' mean but trending towards the higher end of that range.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization in lower demand regime confirmed: Period 4-6 average is 472 units, representing a persistent ~30% reduction from the initial Period 1-2 baseline. A slight recovery trend is emerging (+~35 units over 2 periods).
