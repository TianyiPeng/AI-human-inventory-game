Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The demand for the last 5 periods has been fluctuating but shows a positive trajectory ([694, 576, 685, 715, 774]), with the most recent period reaching a peak of 774. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The current date is 2019/02/11, which marks the transition from late winter into early spring. For 'High-waisted skinny denim trousers,' this is a high-demand transition period as consumers refresh their wardrobes. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: There is a clear upward trend over the last three periods (685 -> 715 -> 774), indicating an average growth of approximately 6% per period. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the consistent upward trend and the seasonal relevance of denim in February, I expect demand to continue increasing slightly. Taking the last value (774) and applying a modest growth factor, the prediction is set at 810.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data shows a demand range between 576 and 774, with an average of approximately 689 units. The most recent observed demand for Period 1 (Feb 11) was 671 units, which aligns closely with the long-term average. The product is a pair of high-waist skinny denim jeans, a staple item usually exhibiting stable demand. As we move further into mid-February, we are approaching the typical Spring fashion transition. While demand remains stable, there is a slight upward trend observed in the latter half of the training data (moving from 576 toward 774). Given the stability of the 670-690 range, I expect the demand to remain consistent with a minor upward bias as the spring season nears.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) shows a stable range between 576 and 774 units in the training period (average ~689). The most recent observed demands for Period 1 and Period 2 are 671 and 673 respectively, showing high stability and consistency with the training data mean. The product is a staple wardrobe item (denim jeans), which typically experiences steady demand with slight increases as the spring season begins in late February. Given the very narrow variance between Period 1 and Period 2 (a difference of only 2 units), the forecast assumes the current demand regime will persist with a slight upward pressure typical of spring retail cycles.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows an average around 680-700 in the training data, but recent local observations in the test phase show a slight downward shift. Period 1 and 2 were stable at 671 and 673, while Period 3 saw a significant drop to 539. Analyzing the calendar (March 4th), we are moving further into the spring season. The transition from February into March typically sees a temporary stabilization or slight recovery after the initial post-winter slump. However, the drop in Period 3 (-20%) suggests a potential cooling of demand. I expect a partial recovery from the Period 3 low as spring shopping picks up, but likely staying below the previous 670 level due to the recent downward momentum.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) started reasonably stable (approx. 670-700 units) but has shown a significant downturn over the last two weeks. Specifically, demand dropped from 673 in Period 2 to 539 in Period 3 (-20%), and further to 447 in Period 4 (-17%). March 11 typically sees a slight seasonal uptick in fashion as spring collections gain traction, but the immediate momentum for this specific item is currently negative. I expect the rate of decline to decelerate as demand stabilizes toward a new baseline or responds to early spring shopping. Forecast logic: Apply a moderated decrease from the last observed point.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -4 to 0) showed a high average demand of approximately 691 units. However, recent observed demand starting from Period 3 (late February) shows a significant downward shift. Demand dropped from the 670s to 539, then further to 447 and 468 in the most recent periods. This indicates a regime change where the product (skinny denim trousers) is seeing reduced interest entering mid-March, potentially due to a shift in seasonal collection preferences or a correction from initial high volumes. Period 5 (468) showed a slight stabilization compared to Period 4 (447), suggesting the floor for this new demand level is around 450-470 units. For Period 6 (March 18), I expect demand to remain within this stabilized lower range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 3: average demand dropped from ~675 units to ~485 units (-28%) over the last three periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) initially averaged around 670-700 units (training data and Periods 1-2). Starting from Period 3 (late February), a significant regime shift occurred with demand dropping to an average of ~485 units over the last four periods (Periods 3-6). The most recent three periods (Periods 4, 5, and 6) show a slight stabilizing trend with a minor upward crawl (447 -> 468 -> 502), suggesting the floor of this new lower regime has been reached. The current date (March 25) aligns with early Spring fashion transitions. While there is a slight upward momentum in the last two weeks, it remains firmly within the new lower demand regime identified in the carry-over insights. I expect a modest continuation of the recent recovery trend without returning to the initial high levels.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim SKU started high (avg ~672 in Periods 1-2) but underwent a confirmed regime shift downward starting in Period 3. Since that shift, demand has stabilized and shown a slight upward trajectory over the last four periods (447 -> 468 -> 502 -> 511). The current date of April 1st coincides with the start of the spring fashion season, where 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' typically maintains steady demand. Given the consistent week-over-week growth of approximately 2-7% in the most recent periods, I anticipate a slight continued increase towards the previous resistance level of ~540.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2183.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows an initial high demand (avg ~672) which dropped significantly in Period 3, establishing a new baseline. Over the last three periods (P6-P8), there is a visible upward trend: 502, 511, to 560 (+9.5% increase in the most recent period). The current date (April 8) falls into the spring season when demand for 'skinny denim' and 'Divided collection' items typically strengthens as consumers refresh wardrobes for warmer weather. Given the consistent week-over-week recovery since Period 4 and the seasonal alignment with early April, I expect a continued moderate increase in demand.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend recovery confirmed: demand has increased for 4 consecutive periods (P5-P8), rising from 468 to 560 units (+19.6% total growth).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed an initial drop (P1-P4) followed by a steady recovery trend (P5-P8). However, Period 9 (2019/04/08) shows a sharp, significant decline from 560 units to 335 units. Period 10 falls on April 15, 2019, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday (April 21). In many retail markets, the week immediately preceding Easter can see erratic demand due to school holidays or pre-holiday shopping shifts. The drop in P9 likely represents a pre-holiday lull or a shift in consumer focus. Given the product is a 'High-waisted skinning denim', it is a staple item likely to see a rebound as spring shopping continues. I expect a partial recovery from the P9 dip, aiming for a level between the recent low and the previous trend line, moderated by the volatile shift observed last week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $825.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant shift in demand patterns. After a recovery trend peaking at 560 units (Period 8), demand has plummeted sharply to 335 (Period 9) and 269 (Period 10). The current date is April 22nd, 2019, which is the Monday following Easter Sunday (April 21st). This explains the sharp drop in demand as the pre-Easter shopping surge has concluded. Given that high-waisted skinny jeans are wardrobe staples but subject to seasonal lulls after major holidays, demand is expected to stabilize at this lower level for a brief period before any potential spring/summer recovery. I am forecasting a slight stabilization at 250 units, reflecting the post-holiday dip.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed: Post-holiday demand drop (Late April) shows a significant decrease from the early April peak (560) to a new low average of ~300 units (-46%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows an initial high (Period 1-2: ~672), a drop to a medium range (Period 3-8: ~480-560), and a recent significant decline starting Period 9. The last three periods (Period 9-11) show a sharp drop with demand stabilizing at a lower level (335, 269, 261). The current date is 2019/4/29, which is post-Easter (April 21) and represents the shift into Late Spring/Pre-Summer. The carry-over insight correctly identified a new regime shift to roughly 300 units or lower. Given the last two data points of 269 and 261, the demand appears to have reached a floor in this post-holiday trough. I forecast a slight stabilization at this new low level for the coming week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a recent regime shift where demand dropped from a peak of 560 (Period 8) to an average of ~288 over Periods 9-11. However, Period 12 (April 29) shows a sudden uptick to 339 units, likely driven by the start of the May holiday season and seasonal transitions to spring wear for 'High-waisted skiny denim'. May 6 (Period 13) typically follows this upward momentum as spring shopping continues. I anticipate a modest increase from the previous week's 339, continuing the short-term recovery trend after the post-Easter trough.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product showed a peak in early April (560 units) followed by a sharp drop in late April/early May to a lower plateau. Observations from Period 9 to 13 show demand fluctuating between 241 and 339 units, with an average of roughly 290 units over the last five periods. Period 13 (241 units) is the lowest point in this range. Given the 'High-waisted jeans' category and the May 13th date, we are entering a transitional season where denim demand often stabilizes or slightly softens before summer. The recent volatility suggests a mean-reverting behavior around the new lower regime established in the carry-over insights. I expect Period 14 to remain within the 240-280 range, likely seeing a small correction from the Period 13 low back toward the recent average.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a distinct downward trajectory. After a peak in early April (Period 8: 560 units), there was a significant regime shift identified in the carry-over insights, dropping the average to ~300. Recent data from Periods 12-14 shows a further deterioration: 339, 241, and 189 units respectively. The most recent period (P14) saw a 21.5% decrease from P13. Given the date (May 20), we are moving further into late spring/early summer where heavy denim demand often softens in favor of lighter materials or shorts. The current trend is clearly bearish, with the moving average of the last three periods sitting at 256, but the 'spot' demand at 189. I will forecast a slight stabilization but still follow the downward momentum.

Carry-over insight: Continued downward trend confirmed: demand has declined for three consecutive weeks (P12-P14), dropping from 339 to 189 units (-44%), moving below the previously established ~300 unit regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for Period 16 (2019/5/27) shows a recent period of significant volatility and a general downward trend from the early April peak. (1) Historical Context: The product (skinny denim) saw a peak in Period 8 (560) followed by a sharp drop and a secondary peak in Period 15 (375). (2) Seasonality: May is transitioning into summer, which typically sees a reduction in high-waisted denim sales as consumers shift toward lighter apparel/shorts. (3) Recent Trend: Period 15 showed a sudden spike to 375 after three weeks of decline (339 -> 241 -> 189). This spike appears to be a mean-reverting outlier or a month-end promotional lift rather than a sustained trend reversal. (4) Forecast Logic: Given the general downward trajectory from 500+ down to the ~200-300 range, and the volatility of the last four weeks (avg ~286), the forecast expects a moderate correction back down from the Period 15 spike, settling around the 300 unit level.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim SKU underwent a significant decline in April/May, dropping to a low of 189 in Period 14. However, the last two periods (P15-P16) show a sharp and sustained recovery, with demand jumping from 189 to 375 (+98%) and then to 533 (+42%). This indicates a regime shift or strong seasonal rebound entering June (Current Date: 2019/6/3). Given the upward trajectory of the last two weeks and the reversal of the previous downward trend, the forecast anticipates continued momentum toward the earlier established baseline of ~500-600 units, though at a slightly moderated growth rate to account for potential stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Trend reversal confirmed Period 16: demand surged from 189 to 533 (+182%) in two weeks, breaking the previous downward trend and establishing a new upward trajectory moving into June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows high volatility with distinct regime shifts. The most recent sequence (Periods 15-17) shows a significant recovery from a May low of 189 units. Specifically, demand surged to 375 and then 533 units before settling at 451 in Period 17 (June 3rd). This indicates a new, higher demand level compared to the April/May slump. The date (June 10th) is in the middle of the summer retail season; as a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' product, it remains a staple, though potentially facing some seasonal competition from shorter garments. The trend analysis shows that after the sharp spike to 533, the slight pull-back to 451 suggests a stabilization or minor mean-reversion. Given the previous Carry-over Insight regarding the upward trajectory in June, I expect demand to remain relatively high but potentially oscillate. A forecast of 465 is chosen to reflect continued strength in the new June regime while acknowledging the recent dip from the 533 peak.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization of June demand regime: Following the surge from 189 to 533 (+182%), demand has stabilized around an average of ~490 units over the last two periods (P16-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a recovery from a May low (189), peaking at 533 in late May, followed by stabilization in June. The last two periods (P17: 451, P18: 462) indicate a narrow trading range with minimal variance (+2.4% change). Mid-June (June 17) typically represents a steady period for year-round staples like skinny denim before potential summer clearance shifts. The forecast anticipates continued stability based on the three-period average (P16-P18) of approximately 482, but weights the most recent two-week stability more heavily, leading to a prediction near the current mean.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Following the late-May surge, demand has stabilized over three consecutive periods (P16-P18) within a range of 450-535, averaging ~482 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU has shown significant volatility with periodic regime shifts. Recently (P16-P18), demand had stabilized at an average of ~482 units following a late May surge. However, Period 19 (2019/6/17) shows a sharp drop to 358 units, a -22.5% decrease from the previous period. Calendar-wise, late June (2019/6/24) often marks the transition into peak summer sales periods or clearance cycles for year-round basics like skinny denim. Given the sudden break in the P16-P18 stability, I am anticipating a mean-reverting behavior toward the lower bound of the current summer regime or a continued seasonal deceleration. I will forecast a slight recovery from the P19 dip but lower than the early June average to account for the downward momentum observed in the most recent week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for Period 21 (early July) shows a significant downward trend over the last two weeks, with demand dropping from 462 to 358 (-22%) and then to 265 (-26%). This indicates a regime shift away from the June average of ~482 units characterized in the previous carry-over insights. The product is 'High-waisted skinning denim', which often sees a seasonal dip in mid-summer (July) as consumers shift toward lighter apparel like shorts or dresses. The current trajectory suggests demand is approaching the lows seen in late April/early May (~189-261 range). Given the momentum of the decline (averaging a loss of ~100 units per week recently), I expect demand to stabilize or slightly decrease further as we enter the peak of summer heat.

Carry-over insight: New downward trend confirmed Period 20: Demand has declined for two consecutive periods (P19-P20), dropping from 462 to 265 units (-42%), breaking the previous June stability regime of ~482 units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product shows high volatility with distinct regimes. The most recent data (Periods 19-21) indicates a significant drop from the June average of ~482 units to a lower range. Specifically, Period 19 (358), Period 20 (265), and Period 21 (353) show a new average of approximately 325 units. The Current Date (2019/7/8) places us in the peak summer season; skinny denim jeans typically experience lower demand during the hottest months (July) compared to spring or back-to-school periods. While Period 21 saw a slight recovery from Period 20, the overall trend since mid-June is downward. My forecast anticipates a slight stabilization or continued low demand consistent with the current summer regime of ~300-350 units.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonality regime confirmed: Demand has shifted from a June average of ~482 to a July average of ~325 units (-32%) over the last three periods (P19-P21).

Predicted demand: 330 units

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a recent 'Summer seasonality regime' established in July (Periods 19-21) where demand dropped from a June average of ~482 to ~325 units. However, the last two observations (Period 21: 353, Period 22: 393) indicate a mild upward correction or stabilization within this summer window. The product is 'High-waisted skinny denim jeans', which is a wardrobe staple but may see slightly increased demand during mid-July retail periods compared to late June. Analysis of recent momentum (353 to 393, +11%) suggests a continued moderate rise or stabilization around the 400-unit mark. Given the seasonal context and the most recent trend, I forecast the next period to slightly increase but remain within the current July variability range.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has entered a stable mid-summer regime. Following the downward shift in late June (P20), demand recovered and has stabilized over the last three periods (P21-P23) with values of 353, 393, and 369. This creates a current 3-period average of 371.7 units. The carry-over insight from P22 regarding a July average of ~325 units is currently being slightly exceeded as the trend consolidates between 350-400 units. Given 'Divided' collection denim is highly staple but fluctuates with seasonal promotions, and with no major retail events occurring in late July to drive a surge, the forecast assumes a continuation of this stable plateau. The recent slight dip from 393 to 369 suggests a minor softening or mean reversion towards the 370 level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime stabilized: Demand has fluctuated within a tight range (353-393) for three consecutive periods (P21-P23), establishing a new stable mean of ~372 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' shows a recent stabilization around 372 units (P21-P23) followed by a sharp drop to 232 units in Period 24. Calendar analysis indicates that late July/early August often coincides with the end-of-season clearance peak followed by a transition to new arrivals. The drop in P24 suggests the clearance peak has passed or inventory levels for this specific color/wash are thinning out, a common occurrence for denim before the 'Back to School' peak in mid-to-late August. Given that demand fell -37% in the most recent period, I anticipate a slight further decline or stabilization at this lower level before any pre-autumn recovery begins.

Carry-over insight: Downward regime shift confirmed Period 24: demand dropped significantly from the ~372 unit July average to 232 units (-37%), signaling the end of the summer peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS is currently in an August transition period. Historically, the recent trend shows a significant drop from the mid-July plateau of ~372 units to a lower range. Period 24 (232 units) and Period 25 (298 units) represent a new, lower demand regime as summer peaks fade. August 5th is typically a quieter retail period before back-to-school momentum fully kicks in. Comparing the recent uptick from 232 to 298 (+28%), a slight recovery or stabilization is expected within this new lower band. I am projecting a modest increase towards the 300-330 range as demand seeks a new equilibrium.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this denim product (Jade HW Skinny Jeans) shows distinct regimes. After a significant drop in late July (P24: 232), demand has been recovering over the last two periods (P25: 298, P26: 381). This recovery aligns with the 'Back-to-School' shopping season in mid-August. The product, being high-waisted skinny jeans, is a staple item for school/university wardrobes. Historically, periods 21-23 averaged ~372 units before the dip. The recent jump from 298 to 381 (+27%) suggests we have entered a new upward trend or returned to the previous mid-summer baseline. Given the date (August 12), I expect demand to continue growing as the school season peaks, likely surpassing the mid-300s baseline.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school upward trend confirmed: Demand has increased for two consecutive periods (P25-P26), rising from 232 to 381 units (+64% from the P24 trough), signaling a departure from the late-July low regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a confirmed 'Back-to-school' upward trend starting in Period 25. Demand has risen significantly for three consecutive periods: 298 (P25), 381 (P26), and 493 (P27), representing a total growth of 112% from the P24 trough (232). This period (Aug 19) is a prime 'Back-to-school' shipping/shopping week for skinny denim, a staple item. The growth rate between P26 and P27 was ~29%. Given the strong momentum, I anticipate demand will peak or slightly stabilize at a high level. However, following the pattern of previous surges (like P16), I will project a moderate continued increase towards the previous high-regime mean of approximately 500-530 units.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Back-to-school surge confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P25-P27), rising from 298 to 493 units (+65%), effectively returning to the late-May peak levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear Back-to-School (BTS) surge starting at Period 25 (July 29), with demand rising from 298 to a peak of 493 in Period 27. The most recent observation (Period 28, Aug 19) showed a slight softening to 432 units but remains significantly elevated compared to July levels (~232). As Period 29 (Aug 26) marks the final week of August and the immediate approach to the school year for many, demand for denim is expected to remain high, though potentially tapering slightly from the mid-August peak. My forecast anticipates a slight stabilization around the 440-450 range, reflecting the tail end of the BTS rush.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a strong 'Back-to-school' surge that peaked in Period 27 at 493 units, following a significant upward trend from Period 25. Since that peak, demand has entered a moderate decline phase (493 -> 432 -> 396), dropping approximately 8-12% per week. Current Date is 2019/9/2, which coincides with the Labor Day holiday in the US and the typical start of the academic year. While holidays often cause a minor temporary lift, the recent trend shows the primary seasonal surge (purchasing before the school year starts) has passed its peak. Following the observed decay rate of the last two periods (~9% decline), a further slight reduction is expected as the market stabilizes post-surge before potentially settling into a fall baseline. Forecast logic: Apply a consistent decline of approximately 10% to the most recent observation (396 units), resulting in ~356 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-Back-to-school peak decline: Demand has decreased for two consecutive periods (P27-P29) from 493 to 396 units (-20% total), confirming the end of the August surge regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 30 (740 units) represents a massive spike, significantly exceeding the previous 'Back-to-school' peak (493) and the high volumes seen in February (670s). This surge aligns with the official start of the academic year in early September and the transition to autumn fashion (jeans being a core staple). Historical data shows that while August (Periods 25-29) saw a gradual rise to ~493 followed by a slight cooling, Period 30 marks a clear regime shift into high-demand seasonality. Given the magnitude of the jump (nearly doubling from the average of the previous two weeks), I expect a slight normalization as the immediate rush subsides, but demand should remain elevated compared to late August. Following the 740 peak, a minor correction to the high 600s is likely based on typical post-peak behavior in retail cycles.

Carry-over insight: Early September Demand Peak: Period 30 indicates a new high regime shift (740 units), representing a 87% increase over the late August average (~396-432), marking the start of the core Autumn denim season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 30 (early September), where demand surged to over 700 units (740 and 708), compared to the late-August average of ~414. This aligns with the 'Autumn Denim Season' and 'Back-to-School' peak observed in the Carry-Over Insights. Recent demand (P30: 740, P31: 708) indicates a minor cooling off (-4%) after the initial spike, but still remains within a high-demand regime relative to previous months. The product (High-waisted skinny denim) is a seasonal staple for September wardrobe transitions. For Period 32 (Sept 16), I anticipate demand to stabilize slightly lower as the initial peak shopping window passes, but remain significantly elevated (~700 range) compared to summer levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Regime confirmed: Demand has maintained a high level (average >720 units) for two consecutive periods (P30-P31), representing a sustained ~75% increase over the August average.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has entered a strong Autumn regime starting in early September (Period 30). (1) Historically, the last three periods have shown a high and stable volume: 740, 708, and 707 units, averaging ~718 units. (2) Calendar context (September 23) is a peak period for autumn denim shopping as cooler weather sets in. (3) The recent trend is extremely stable (variance of only 1 unit between P31 and P32), suggesting a sustained plateau rather than a temporary spike. (4) Given the consistency of the last two periods at ~708 units and the established Autumn Demand Regime, I forecast the demand to remain stable for this period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Regime fully stabilized: Demand has remained locked within a narrow range (707-708 units) for the last three periods (P30-P32), confirming a new high-volume baseline of ~718 units for the September denim peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim) has entered its peak autumn season. Periods 30-32 established a stable high-demand regime of approximately 718 units. Period 33 saw a massive 102% spike to 1428 units, likely driven by a combination of end-of-month paydays and the intensification of autumn fashion shopping. While such a sharp spike often experiences a correction in the following week, the seasonal relevance of denim in early October suggests demand will remain significantly elevated compared to the early September baseline. I anticipate a partial regression from the Period 33 peak, settling into a new high-volume range for the upcoming weeks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift/spike confirmed Period 33: demand surged from a stable baseline of ~718 units to 1428 units (+99%), marking a significant escalation in the Autumn denim peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift in Period 30, where demand moved from an August average of ~430 to an Autumn baseline of ~725 units. While Period 33 exhibited a massive spike (1428 units), likely due to a specific promotion or event, Period 34 (748 units) saw a return to the established high-volume Autumn regime. As we are now in early October, which is peak season for high-waisted denim as temperatures cool, I expect demand to remain stable within the high-volume baseline observed across Periods 30, 31, 32, and 34 (averaging ~726 units). There is no evidence yet that the spike in P33 was a permanent shift, but the return to ~750 units suggests strong, sustained seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Outlier identified Period 33 (1428 units); demand has since returned to the previously established Autumn baseline of ~725 units (P30-P32, P34), suggesting the spike was a temporary event rather than a permanent regime shift.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has recently been in an 'Autumn peak' regime. From Periods 30-34 (excluding the P33 outlier of 1428), demand was very stable around a mean of ~725 units. However, Period 35 (2019/10/07) shows a shift down to 606 units, a -19% decrease from the previous week. Historically, denim demand often experiences a mid-October lull after the initial September 'Back-to-School/Autumn' surge and before the late-season or holiday shifts. Given the consistent decline observed from P34 to P35 and the historical context of late summer/early autumn peaks tapering off, I expect the demand to continue this slight downward trajectory or stabilize at a lower level for the current period (mid-October).

Carry-over insight: Downshift in Autumn regime confirmed: Period 35 demand (606) dropped 19% below the previously stable September average (~725), signaling a cooling of the peak demand period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) shows distinct seasonality and regime shifts. After a sustained high-volume period in September (P30-P34) where demand averaged ~725 units (excluding the P33 outlier of 1428), demand has entered a cooling phase in October. In P35 (Oct 7) and P36 (Oct 14), demand dropped to 606 and 581 units respectively, representing a two-week downward trend. This total decline of ~20% from the September baseline suggests that the peak Autumn denim season is tapering off as weather transitions further into late Autumn. As we enter the week of Oct 21 (P37), there are no major immediate retail holidays to trigger a spike, so I anticipate the current downward trajectory to continue slightly or stabilize toward the next lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand cooling: Demand has decreased for three consecutive periods relative to the September peak (P34-P36), dropping from 748 to 581 units (-22%), indicating a transition away from the high-volume Autumn regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
After the high-volume Autumn peak in September (average ~725 units), demand has cooled throughout October. The last three periods (P35-P37) show demand settling into a new lower regime with observations of 606, 581, and 643, resulting in a three-period average of ~610 units. While Period 37 showed a slight uptick from the Period 36 low, it remains significantly below the September peak. For late October, I anticipate demand will continue to stabilize within this new 580-650 range as the market waits for the holiday shopping season to begin in November.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: post-Autumn peak demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P35-P37) at a mean of ~610 units, representing a 16% decline from the September average (~725 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization after the September peak (P30-P34). Following the peak, demand settled into a lower baseline of ~610 units (P35-P37). However, the last two observations (P37-P38) show a slight upward movement (643, 663), suggesting the cooling period has ended and a new slight growth phase or a pre-holiday build-up is occurring. Period 39 (2019/11/4) is early November, a period where denim demand often sees a moderate increase leading into the Black Friday/Holiday season. Given the recent growth of ~3% in P38 following a 10% jump in P37, I expect a continued moderate increase, targeting the upper end of the current ~610-660 range.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend recovery confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P36-P38), rising from 581 to 663 units (+14%), indicating an exit from the post-Autumn cooling phase and potentially identifying a pre-holiday growth regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows that following the mid-September peak (~725 units), demand entered a cooling phase in October (averaging ~610-630 units). However, Period 39 (2019/11/04) shows a significant drop to 485 units, a 27% decline from the previous period (663). This decline aligns with the historical 'lull' period typically observed in retail between the Autumn/Back-to-School season and the late-November holiday surge (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). For the current period (2019/11/11), demand is expected to remain in this transitional lower-volume phase before the holiday peak begins. Given the sharp drop in Period 39, the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization or continued low-level demand around the 500-unit mark.

Carry-over insight: New downward regime shift confirmed Period 39: Demand dropped from a stable average of ~630 units to 485 units (-23%), breaking the pre-holiday upward trend and signaling a mid-November lull.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a core Autumn peak for this denim SKU (P30-P34) followed by a stabilization/cooling phase in October (P35-P38) averaging ~623 units. In November, demand has become more volatile: Period 39 saw a significant drop to 485, followed by a recovery to 581 in Period 40. This recovery suggests the drop in P39 was a temporary dip rather than a permanent downshift to a lower regime. The current date (Nov 18) is approaching the major late-November retail events (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Historically, demand for staples like skinny jeans tends to lift as holiday shopping begins. However, given the most recent data point of 581 and the previous month's stable average of ~623, I expect a moderate upward movement towards that late-autumn baseline as shopping activity intensifies, but before the massive holiday peak fully ignites.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (706016001) is currently in a mid-November stabilization phase. Historically, the regime shifted downward in P39 (from ~630 units to 485 units) and has since hovered between 485 and 581 units, with the last two periods (P40-P41) averaging 564 units. The current date (2019/11/25) coincides with the lead-up to Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019) and Cyber Monday. In the retail fashion sector, specifically for staple items like 'High-waisted jeans', this period typically sees a significant surge in demand as consumers shop holiday sales. While P41 (547 units) showed a slight dip from P40, the upcoming calendar event strongly suggests a reversal and spike. I expect demand to increase significantly over the previous week's level, returning towards the high-autumn baseline of ~700+ units due to promotional activity.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a massive demand spike in Period 42 (3100 units) coinciding with the week of Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019). The current period (Period 43, starting Dec 2, 2019) includes Cyber Monday, which typically results in elevated demand compared to the standard baseline but is significantly lower than the primary Black Friday peak. Looking at the previous major peak in Period 33 (1428 units), demand immediately returned to the 700-range (~50% of peak) in the following week. Given the pre-peak baseline was approximately 540 units (Periods 39-41), I expect a similar sharp reversion toward that mean, with a slight elevation remaining due to Cyber Monday and ongoing December holiday shopping. Therefore, I forecast a return to the post-Autumn/pre-holiday baseline levels of approximately 700 units.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday Outlier confirmed: Period 42 demand (3100) represents a nearly 6x increase over the November baseline, marking a temporary promotional spike rather than a permanent regime shift.

Predicted demand: 715 units

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for Period 43 (674 units) represents a return to the high-Autumn/early-winter baseline after the massive Black Friday promotional spike in Period 42 (3100 units). For Period 44 (Dec 9th), we are in the peak holiday shopping window. Historically, denim (a core wardrobe item) sees sustained interest in early-to-mid December. Looking at recent non-outlier data: Period 38 (663) and Period 43 (674) suggest a stable demand regime near the 670-unit mark. As we progress further into December, demand typically remains robust or slightly increases as holiday shopping intensifies before the pre-Christmas cutoff. However, since the product is a core item (high-waisted jeans) rather than a specific gift item, I expect demand to remain relatively stable around the current post-promotion baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization confirmed: Demand in Period 43 (674 units) successfully returned to the pre-November-lull regime (~630-670 units), indicating that the promotional spike did not cannibalize immediate future demand for this core denim SKU.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim has stabilized following the Black Friday outlier (P42: 3100 units). In the two weeks post-promotion, demand has returned to a consistent baseline (P43: 674, P44: 680), which aligns with the historical pre-holiday regime identified in the carry-over insights (~630-670 units). Since the current date (Dec 16) is the peak week for pre-Christmas retail shopping, I anticipate a slight seasonal uptick compared to the previous two flat weeks. Based on the consistency of the last two periods and the high historical relevance of denim staples as gifts or holiday party wear, a modest increase from the 680 baseline is forecasted.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand stability: Post-Black Friday demand has stabilized for two consecutive periods (P43-P44) at an average of 677 units, confirming that the promotional peak did not cannibalize mid-December demand.

Predicted demand: 715 units

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has established a remarkably stable December regime following the Black Friday spike. Over the last three periods (P43-P45), demand has converged on a mean of approximately 670 units (674, 680, 657), which aligns closely with the early-year baseline (~670-680) and the mid-autumn pre-peak regime. The current date (2019/12/23) covers the Christmas week. While retail often sees a 'Boxing Day' or post-holiday clearance surge, for a staple denim SKU, demand typically remains steady or slightly retracts as consumer focus shifts from gifting to self-purchase/returns. Given the current stability and the 3.4% decline observed in the most recent period (P45), I forecast a slight softening of demand into the holiday week while staying within the established high-600s regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for Period 46 (Christmas week) shows a significant drop from the stable December average of ~670 units down to 475 units. Period 47 (the week of December 30th) follows Christmas and transitions into the New Year. Generally, for core denim staples, demand remains suppressed immediately following the holiday peak before the January clearance cycle begins. Given the 28% drop observed in Period 46, and acknowledging the typical post-holiday lull where consumer spending temporarily retracts, I expect demand to stabilize around the most recent observation or continue a minor downward trend before the January reset. Historically, after similar regime shifts (like in late April), demand stayed low for multiple periods. Therefore, the forecast reflects a slight continuation of the lower-demand post-holiday regime.

Carry-over insight: New downward regime shift confirmed Period 46: Demand dropped from the stable holiday average of ~670 units to 475 units (-29%), marking the end of the December peak and the onset of the post-holiday lull.

Predicted demand: 455 units
