Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie Thong). There is no prior period conclude message yet, and on-hand/in-transit start at 0. Historical demand over the last 5 periods is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122]. There is a visible downward trend in the last few periods (from ~300 down to 122). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent average demand while acknowledging the recent dip, setting the basis for (1+L) coverage. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the recent volatility. L will be the promised default of 4.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The item is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a staple lingerie item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we placed an order for 367 units, which is currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0, and because we had no stock in Period 1, all 159 units of demand were lost (sold=0). Historical demand samples are [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], plus the recent observation of 159. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 223. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean (223) * 5 = 1115 for mu_hat. Given the stockout and the need to build inventory once the lead time elapses, I will use 'default' methods which calculate across all available samples to provide a stable baseline for the OR engine while we wait for the first shipment to arrive in Period 5.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Starting on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (promised lead time is 4 periods). History shows unmet demand in P1 (159) and P2 (373), which is lost sales since we have no inventory. The past demand sequence (267, 298, 307, 189, 122) followed by P1 (159) and P2 (373) shows high volatility but no clear trend shift yet. Since the promised lead time is 4, we expect the first order from P1 to arrive in P5. The 'In-transit' total of 719 corresponds to orders from P1 (367) and P2 (352). I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 (demand) to capture the recent higher demand (mean of [307, 189, 122, 159, 373] = 230), as the long-term mean is slightly lower. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of women's thong briefs (Womens Lingerie). Current Period is 4 (March 4, 2019). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 1124 units in-transit. Historically, demand over the last 5 periods (including pre-game data) was [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the first three game periods saw [159, 373, 301]. The average demand is approximately 252 units/period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (367 units) are expected to arrive in the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (available for our Period 6 decision). Currently, we are stocked out (ending inventory 0 for 3 consecutive periods) because initial inventory was 0 and the lead time has not yet elapsed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand level, while keeping L at 'default' (4 weeks) until we observe actual arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a staple lingerie item. Current inventory is critically low (on-hand: 0) with a significant backlogged demand (total lost sales = 1,111 units over Periods 1-4). Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, it is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Based on historical demand [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the more recent demand observations since starting the game [159, 373, 301, 278], the demand is volatile but averages around 280 units per week. I will use the 'default' L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the recent game-play demand dynamics. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the 1-period review cycle (L+1=5 periods of demand covering roughly 1,400 units).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Looking at the history, demand has been fairly consistent over the last 5 periods (mean=272.2, std=78.8). The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since we just received our first shipment, we finally have on-hand inventory (117 units after demand resolution). With 1190 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), the pipeline is well-filled, especially considering these are expected to arrive in P6, P7, P8, and P9 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stable demand mean over all available periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5. For the lead time, 'default' is sufficient as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple women's thong brief (Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p). Current history (Periods 1-6) shows observed demand: [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216]. The mean demand is approximately 263 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6). On-hand inventory is 253, and there are 1039 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Total pipeline inventory is 1292 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of average demand. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all 6 historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most stable baseline for this SKU while the inventory levels catch up from the initial stocking phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $607.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong underwear (standard basic). Historically (including the provided 5 pre-game samples), demand has fluctuated between 122 and 373. Recent weekly demand (P1-P7) averages approximately 261 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals in P5, P6, and P7 (all had an actual lead time of 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 405 units and in-transit is 735 (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 7 periods as a regime (N=7), the mean demand is 261.4, so mu_hat (1+L)*mean is approximately 1307. Since pipeline inventory (405 on-hand + 735 in-transit = 1140) is relatively high, the OR backend will throttle the order size to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level target of 80% (Profit $4 / (4+1)).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on P5, P6, and P7 arrivals. Demand regime stable around 261 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P9 (2019/04/08). Analyzing historical demand [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253, 283], the mean demand since P1 is approximately 250 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P4 orders arriving in P5-P8). Current on-hand is 340, and in-transit is 811. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) of 1151 units covers about 4.6 weeks of average demand. To ensure we don't stock out given a 4-period lead time, I will use a 5-period average for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the stable demand around 261 units (avg of last 5: 250, 216, 253, 283, plus a slightly higher projection for current cycle). Sigma_hat will also be based on N=5 to reflect recent volatility and provide a safe buffer for the 80% service level target (based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's cotton thong 3-pack, a stapled underwear item with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-9) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has fluctuated between 176 and 283. The most recent demand (P9) was 176, but the overall mean since stocking began (P5-P9) is 235.6. Given the dates (April), there are no major immediate seasonal spikes expected for this category, but we must maintain enough stock to cover the review period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1=5 weeks). Current on-hand is 379 and in-transit is 776. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover 5 weeks of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the performance since the initial stockout phase ended, and calculate for lead time since the 4-period lead time is now well-established.

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) is currently in Period 11 (late April). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P6. Recent demand (P9-P10) has dipped to 176 and 169 units, following a period of higher demand (avg ~261). This downward trend should be reflected to avoid overstocking, especially since current on-hand inventory (411) plus in-transit (675) is high (1086 units total) compared to recent demand levels. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mean and standard deviation to capture this recent cooling of demand while maintaining enough coverage for the 4+1 period cycle. Profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies a moderate service level, but the high pipeline suggests the OR backend will likely order a minimum amount to prevent excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P9: demand decreased from a previous average of ~260 to ~172 (-33%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is cotton thong briefs. We have recorded a demand regime shift starting Period 9, where demand dropped from an average of ~260 to ~172 units/week (-33%). The three most recent weeks (P9, P10, P11) show very stable demand at 176, 169, and 176 respectively (average 173.7). This suggests a new lower baseline. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P5-P11 records). On-hand inventory is 336, with 678 in-transit (P8-P11 orders). Total pipeline is 1014 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current rate (~174/week), we need roughly 870 units. Since on-hand + in-transit (1014) already exceeds this, the OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order to reduce holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower demand regime and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for the low volatility in this new period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 average demand is 173.7, compared to previous Period 1-8 average of 266.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has shown high volatility. While Periods 9-11 established a lower demand regime (~174 units), Period 12 showed a significant spike to 323 units. This spike coincides with late April/early May, which may reflect a pre-summer or mid-season shift. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Period 12's demand is an outlier compared to the last 3 periods, but cannot be ignored. I will use recent_N with N=4 to balance the lower demand from P9-11 with the sudden surge in P12 (average of [176, 169, 176, 323] = 211 units/period). Lead time L is set to 'default' as it is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 12 (323 units) after a 3-period low-demand regime (avg ~174); monitoring for a new higher demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility: a low-demand regime (avg ~174) in P9-P11, followed by a spike in P12 (323) and a drop in P13 (122). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 193.2 units, while the longer-term average is higher. The product is a core lingerie staple (cotton thongs), which typically has steady demand but can experience fluctuations due to promotions or inventory replenishment cycles. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high period-to-period variance (122 to 323), using a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat better captures the current slightly lower average while acknowledging the volatility. I will use the default sigma_hat calculation to ensure the base stock covers this high demand variance. Pipeline inventory (538) and on-hand (365) are significant, and with L=4, the system is aiming for a 5-period window coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly volatile with no clear stable regime after the Period 9 shift; Period 9-13 average is 193.2 units compared to the pre-P9 average of 266.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for women's lingerie (thong briefs) has shown significant volatility recently. After a period of lower demand (P9-P11 avg ~174), demand spiked in P12 (323) then dropped again in P13-P14 (avg ~136). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is 186.2 units. Promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P10 arrived P14). I will use N=6 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent unstable regime while anchoring for the OR backend's safety stock calculation. L is set to 'calculate' as the history provides consistent data points for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the P9 shift; Period 9-14 average demand is 186.2 units, significantly lower than the P1-P8 average of 266 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 71 units for the recent period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple lingerie item (cotton thongs). Analyzing the history from Period 9 onwards (Date: 2019/4/8 to 2019/5/20), demand has entered a lower, more volatile regime. The average demand over these last 7 periods (P9-P15) is 184 units/period, compared to the initial regime average of 266. Lead time is consistently confirming at 4 periods (as seen in the clear arrival sequence from P11-P15). Current on-hand is 247, with 645 in transit (orders from P12-P15: 0+334+201+110=645). Total pipeline inventory is 892 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using a recent_N approach (N=7 to cover the current regime), mu_hat will be estimated based on the 184 units/period average, which provides a total target (base stock) sufficient to cover expected needs without over-ordering, considering the pipeline is already substantial.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-P9 confirmed: average demand decreased to 184 units/period (P9-P15 data) from previous 266 (-31%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we observe that the order placed in Period 12 (ordered=0) correctly resulted in arrived=0 in Period 16, confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand for Period 16 was 200 units. Looking at the demand regime since Period 9, the average demand is approximately 186.5 units ((176+169+176+323+122+151+171+200)/8). Although Period 12 was an outlier (323), the overall trend is much lower than the initial Period 1-8 average of 266. The current on-hand inventory is low (47), but there is a significant amount in-transit (794 units), specifically orders from Period 13 (334 units) and Period 14 (201 units) which are expected to arrive in Period 17 and 18 respectively. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) of this current lower-demand regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 9) has stabilized around an average of 183 units per period (P9-P17 mean = 182.7). Period 16 showed a missed arrival (P12 ordered 0 units, which is correctly reflected), and Period 17 saw the arrival of the Period 13 order with the promised 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 227 units, and in-transit is 662 units (Orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total pipeline + on-hand is 889 units. Five periods of average demand (~183 * 5 = 915) suggests the current position is slightly below the target, but given the volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 57 for the recent period), I will use the recent_N method (N=9, covering the shift from P9 onwards) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple item (Women's Thong briefs). Current date is 2019/6/17. Demand analysis shows a significant shift in Period 9. The average demand from Period 1 to Period 8 was approximately 266 units. From Period 9 to Period 18, the average demand is 192.5 units, though volatility remains high (standard deviation of ~65 units in this recent period). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The 'arrived=0' in Period 16 conclude reflects that no order was placed in Period 12 (ordered=0), confirming lead-time stability. Current on-hand is 147 units with 592 units in-transit. I will use the recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the lower demand regime since Period 9 while accounting for the recent spike (281 units in P18). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most relevant demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9-18 averaged 192.5 units/period, a ~28% reduction from the P1-P8 average of 266. Volatility remains high with recent demand ranging from 122 to 323.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am managing SKU 464297007 (Women's thong briefs). As of Period 20 (late June), there is a significant recent demand spike: Period 19 demand was 556 units, more than double the previous average. This follows a period of high volatility. In-transit inventory includes a missing shipment from Period 12 (0 units ordered) and a delayed/missing shipment from Period 16 (149 units ordered), which should have arrived in Period 20 (based on L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0. With L=4, I need to cover demand for Period 20-24. Given the massive spike in Period 19, I will use a recent demand average weighted towards the last 5 periods (including the spike) to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle potential sustained high demand, but I'll cap the impact slightly using recent_N=5 rather than a longer average. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 when shipments arrive, but the missing Period 16 arrival suggests potential stockout risk. I will keep L at default (4) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike detected: Period 19 demand (556) is ~190% higher than the P9-P18 average of 192.5 units. Shipments from Period 12 (0 units) and Period 16 (149 units) are effectively missing or delayed as of Period 20 start.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with significant backlogged demand (lost sales in P19 and P20). Period 19 saw a demand spike of 556 units, while Period 20 demand was 261 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 290.4 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime (~192 units). The order from Period 12 (ordered 0) effectively created a supply gap, and the order from Period 17 (202 units) is expected to arrive during Period 21. Given the recent spike, I am using an 'explicit' L=5 to account for potential replenishment delays or the transit gap and setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods' mean (290.4 * (1+5)) to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining safety stock (sigma_hat) based on the recent higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Period 16-20 average demand increased to 290.4 units, reversing the low-demand trend observed from P9-P15. Inventory reached 0 in P19 and P20 due to this spike.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has shown significant volatility recently. After a low-demand regime (P9-P15 avg ~184), we saw a major spike in P19 (556) followed by stabilized but higher demand in P20 (261) and P21 (201). The Period 16-21 average is approximately 280 units. Lead time appears stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P17 order (202 units) in P21. Although the P12 order (0 units) was effectively a non-arrival and the P16 order arrived as scheduled, the high pipeline (1521 units) due to recent large orders in P20 and P21 (546 and 549 units respectively) must be balanced. Since one order (P12) resulted in 0 units, I will continue to monitor for lost shipments, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering given the massive in-transit volume. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering the shift from P16 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Period 16-21 average demand is 280 units/period with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 138). Pipeline is heavily loaded with ~1100 units from P20-P21 orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following a demand surge that began in Period 19. Demand for the last four periods (P19-P22) has averaged 339.75 units, significantly higher than the P9-P18 average of ~193. Demand in P22 specifically was 341. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods, with orders from P18 arriving correctly in P22. Although 295 units (ordered P19) are expected to arrive in P23, the system remains in a stockout state. The pipeline is currently heavy with 1519 units in transit (mostly from P20 and P21 orders). To balance the stockout risk against the risk of over-ordering once the massive pipeline arrives, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime (last 4 periods, N=4) and scaling L to the promised 4 periods. The OR backend's cap mechanism will likely limit the order size this period given the large (1519) pipeline already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: mean demand increased to ~340 units/period (P19-P22) from the previous low-demand regime of ~193 (P9-P18). Stockout occurred from P19-P22 due to this sharp increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1180.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 19. Recent demands have been 556, 261, 201, 341, and 422, resulting in zero on-hand inventory for several periods due to stockouts. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 356.2 units, a significant increase from the previous average (~190). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to recent 'conclude' messages. However, there is a missing order from Period 12 (ordered 0, which is fine) and no mention of the Period 16 order being 'lost'\u2014it arrived in Period 20. The current pipeline is very high (1696 units) because of large defensive orders (546 in P20, 549 in P21, 129 in P22, 472 in P23). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At a mean of ~356 per period, we need ~1780 units. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 1696, the OR backend will calculate an additional order based on these parameters. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this current spike, while recent_N=8 for sigma_hat captures the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P19-P23 average demand is 356.2 units/period (+85% from P9-P18). Inventory remains at 0 due to sustained high demand exceeding recent arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 19. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 319.3 units, significantly higher than previous periods. While Period 24 demand was lower (135), the previous periods showed spikes up to 556. Inventory has just recovered from a several-period stockout (ending P24 with 411 on-hand). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22, P23, and P24). Given the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 163 for the last 6 periods) and high demand level, I will use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's characteristics while maintaining a healthy pipeline for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P19-P24: Mean demand is 319.3 units (+65% over P9-P18 average), with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 163). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of demand transition. Following a significant spike (P19-P23), demand has cooled in the last two periods (P24: 135, P25: 133). However, the high levels seen recently (averaging ~319 units from P19-P24) and the risk of stockouts during those weeks necessitate a balanced approach. We currently have 827 units on-hand and 938 in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24). The order from P22 (129 units) is expected to arrive in P26. Total pipeline plus on-hand is roughly 1765 units. Over a 5-period horizon (L+1), at the recent high average of ~320 units/period, we need ~1600 units. Our current coverage is slightly above that, which is appropriate given the high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 163). I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the high-demand regime while reflecting the very recent cooling, as the backend's capped policy will moderate ordering given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; recent P24-P25 demand (avg 134) is significantly lower than the P19-P23 peak (avg 356), suggesting the spike may be subsiding or seasonal. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has experienced significant demand volatility since Period 19. A major spike occurred (Periods 19-23) followed by a sharp drop in demand in Periods 24-25 (avg ~134), and another rebound in Period 26 (339). The current on-hand inventory is 617 units, and the pipeline is extremely high at 809 units (mostly from large orders in P23 and P24). Specifically, 472 units ordered in P23 are expected this period (P27), and 337 units ordered in P24 are expected in P28. Given the promised lead time (L=4) remains accurate, the current inventory and pipeline total 1,426 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand even at the high-demand regime average (~280). To avoid excessive holding costs from over-stocking during this unpredictable phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the volatile behavior since the Period 19 spike began, while allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering due to the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly unstable post-P19 spike; P19-P26 demand average is 300.9 with high variance (min 133, max 556). Supply is now catching up with large arrivals in P24-P26 and expected in P27.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong briefs) has experienced a highly volatile period since P19, with demand reaching up to 556 and dropping as low as 133. The average demand for the most recent 9 periods (P19-P27) is approximately 293 units, which is higher than the P9-P18 low-demand regime (~193) and slightly higher than the initial P1-P8 regime (~266). The pipeline is now well-supplied after high orders in P20-P23 arrived: On-hand is 846, and In-transit is 680 (P24, P25, P26, and P27 orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma is approximately 140 for the recent regime), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current mean and variability. The target base stock covers 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). With 1526 units total inventory (on-hand + in-transit), the system is currently over-supplied relative to the expected 5-period demand (~1465 units), but maintaining parameters based on the current regime ensures the backend maintains a safe buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P19 spike: Period 19-27 average demand is 293.3 units/period (\u03c3 \u2248 140), representing a 52% increase from the previous Period 9-18 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-683.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has shown a significant increase in mean and high volatility, with an average of approximately 283 units per period (P19-P28). However, very recent demand in Periods 24, 25, and 28 suggests a potential cooling off (values of 135, 133, and 100). Current on-hand inventory is high (1083 units) due to recent large arrivals from orders placed during the stockout phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand and in-transit inventory (total 1622 units) relative to recent demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher post-P19 average while acknowledging the volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent high variance. This approach ensures base stock reflects the current unpredictable demand phase while preventing excessive over-ordering given the current healthy stock position.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has shown significant volatility post-Period 19. After a sharp spike and subsequent stockouts, demand has moderated over the last three periods (P27-P29) to an average of 155.7 units. However, the broader regime since P19 averages approximately 274 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 959 units with 554 units in transit (expected arrivals from P27-P29 orders). The Period 12 order (originally 0 units) and Period 25 order (0 units) are accounted for, and the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the recent demand dip and the large pipeline, the backend will naturally limit new orders. I will use a recent_N of 11 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the period from the P19 spike to the present (P19-P29) to reflect the current high-volatility, higher-mean regime while acknowledging the recent slowdown. This balances the risk of another spike against the current high holding levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-P19 spike (P19-P29) averages 274.5 units/period with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 147), though the most recent 3 periods show a dip to ~156 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has entered a lower phase following the P19-P23 spike. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) is approximately 168 units, which is significantly lower than the P19-P29 average of 274. In the most recent 3 periods (P28-P30), demand has averaged 108 units. With on-hand inventory at 858 units and 610 units in-transit, we are currently overstocked relative to the recent demand trend. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture this downward shift (average ~168/period) while maintaining a buffer for the high historical volatility (sigma_hat set via recent_N of 12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 24-30 average demand has decreased to 167.9 units/period, down from the P19-P23 spike average of 356 units. Inventory levels are high (858 on-hand) relative to this new lower demand.

=== Period 31 Summary ===
464297007: ordered=0, arrived=343 units (ordered on Period 27, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=1201, demand=77, sold=77, ending on-hand inventory=1124

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime following the large spike observed between Periods 19-23. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P24-P31) is 156.5 units, with a very low recent demand of 77 units in Period 31. This is a significant decrease from the previous regime average (~293 units). We are currently overstocked with 1124 units on hand, which at the current demand rate of ~150 units/period, represents over 7 weeks of supply. Therefore, the goal is to avoid ordering while this excess inventory is processed, especially since the holding cost is $1/unit. I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to reflect this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P27 order arriving exactly in P31.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 24-31 average demand decreased to 156.5 units/period (down ~47% from the P19-P27 average of 293). Current inventory levels are high (1100+) relative to this new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-350.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU 464297007 has entered a new lower regime. From Period 28 to Period 32, demand values were 100, 124, 101, 77, and 194, averaging approximately 119.2 units per period. This is significantly lower than the previous high-demand spike (P19-P23 avg: 356) and the subsequent stabilization (P19-P27 avg: 293). Currently, the on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1126 units, which is enough to cover nearly 10 weeks of current average demand. To minimize holding costs and prevent further overstocking, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) to reflect this lower demand environment. I will use 'calculate' for the lead time as the observed lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lower demand regime confirmed: Period 28-32 average demand is 119.2 units/period, a ~59% reduction from the Period 19-27 average of 293 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2319.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive demand spike of 692 units, which is significantly higher than the recent average (~119 units) and even higher than the peak of the Period 19 spike (556 units). This surge has rapidly depleted on-hand inventory from 1126 to 449 units. Given the product is a cotton thong (Womens Lingerie) and the date is late September, this might represent a specific promotional event or seasonal shift. Our current pipeline is very thin (only 56 units in-transit from Period 30), meaning we are vulnerable to stockouts if this high demand continues over the 4-period lead time. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 10-period average (which includes the high-volatility P19-P33 range) to ensure the base stock is high enough to handle further spikes, while sigma_hat is set to capture the extreme variance observed recently. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike detected Period 33: demand reached 692 units, a ~480% increase over the P28-P32 average (119.2), significantly higher than any previous observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1170.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 and 34, we observed a massive demand spike (692 and 335 units respectively), totaling 1,027 units over two weeks. This is a dramatic departure from the previous 5-period average of ~119 units and suggests a significant seasonal or trend-based shift (early October). The current on-hand inventory is 170, and the in-transit pipeline is 520 units (all from the large P34 order). With lead time stable at 4 periods, these 520 units won't arrive until Period 38. The demand in Period 33 alone exceeded the entire currently planned pipeline. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand regime, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture the current spike's intensity (average ~513.5 per period) and setting a high sigma_hat (explicitly at 200) to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 77 to 692 in recent weeks). This ensures the base stock calculation targets a much higher inventory level to buffer against continued high demand.

Carry-over insight: Major demand spike detected P33-P34: average demand jumped to 513.5 units/period, compared to the P28-P32 average of 119.2 (+330%). This follows a similar high-volatility pattern seen in P19.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) is currently exhibiting extreme volatility, characterized by massive spikes followed by sharp drops. Most recently, Period 33 saw an unprecedented spike to 692 units, followed by 335 in Period 34 and a drop to 123 in Period 35. This pattern mirrors the spike seen around Period 19. Inventory is currently low (47 units) while pipeline is high (1181 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P30 order arrived P34). Given the 'high-low' nature of these spikes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the elevated average demand (approx 218 units/period) resulting from the P33-P34 surge, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the significant volatility (standard deviation > 200). This will signal the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock to buffer against the next potential spike while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility confirmed: Period 33-35 average demand is 383 units (range 123-692), significantly higher and more volatile than the P28-P32 low-demand regime (avg 119). Pipeline is currently saturated with orders from P34-P35.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following an extreme demand spike in P33-P34 (avg ~513) which significantly depleted the high inventory levels held in P32. While demand in P35-P36 moderated (avg 111.5), the system is catching up with a large pipeline of 1437 units. Period 37 marks the end of October, entering the pre-holiday season for lingerie. Historical data shows two distinct volatility spikes (P19 and P33). We are currently in a high-volatility regime. I will use recent_N (N=4, covering P33-P36) to capture the recent mean demand (approx 312.5 units/period) and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using these recent high-demand samples ensures the base stock is high enough to handle potential holiday spikes while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility confirmed: Period 33-36 average demand is 312.5 units (range 100-692), significantly higher than the P28-P32 average of 119. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 is experiencing extreme demand volatility and stockouts. Period 33 saw an unprecedented spike to 692 units, followed by significant demand levels (335, 123, 100, 124). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with active stockouts occurring in Periods 36 and 37. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, meaning orders placed in P34 (520 units) are expected to arrive in Period 38 (this period), and orders from P35 (661 units) in Period 39. To address the stockout and the high volatility (avg ~275 units over P33-P37), \u03bc\u0302 is set to 300 units per period (multiplied by 1+L) and \u03c3\u0302 is set to 150 units per period (multiplied by sqrt(1+L)) using the explicit method. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for recent high demand and mitigates the risk of further stockouts while we wait for the large pipeline (2079 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: P33-P37 average demand is 274.8 (range 100-692), compared to the P28-P32 average of 119. On-hand inventory exhausted as of P36. Pipeline of 2079 units expected to resolve stockout starting P38.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of extreme demand volatility. We recently observed a massive demand spike (P33: 692, P34: 335), following a period of very low demand (P28-P32 avg: 119). The most recent four periods (P35-P38) show demand returning to lower levels (avg: 115.5), which is closer to the pre-spike baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is heavily loaded (1559 units) from large orders placed during the stockout (P35-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 405. Given the extreme volatility seen in P19 and P33, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P33-P38) to capture the spike's gravity while allowing the lower recent demand to pull the estimate down. Since the pipeline is already very large (covering many periods of even peak demand), the backend 'cap' and base stock logic will likely result in a zero or small order, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs as supply catches up.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility confirmed: Period 33-34 saw a massive spike (avg 513), followed by a return to lower levels in P35-P38 (avg 115.5). Pipeline is heavily saturated with 1559 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of high demand volatility. We had a massive demand spike in P33-P34 (avg 513), which was followed by a moderate period (P35-P39 avg 140). However, the P39 demand of 241 suggests a potential upward trend or continued instability. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 825 and a massive pipeline of 898 (orders from P36 and P37), our total inventory position is 1723. This is approximately 6-7 weeks of supply based on the long-term post-spike average (approx 274), but only 3 weeks if another extreme spike (max observed ~700) occurs. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the heavy incoming pipeline, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the mix of the P33-P34 spike and the subsequent correction, while using recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility (range 100-692). This ensures the base stock stays elevated enough to handle another spike without over-ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: Period 33-39 shows a range of 100 to 692 units. While the massive spike in P33-P34 has subsided, demand in P39 (241) indicates ongoing instability compared to the P28-P32 low (avg 119).

Daily Reward (R_t): $854.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P39-P40) indicates that the extreme volatility observed since P33 continues, with demand increasing to 387 in P40. The massive spike in P33-P34 (avg 513) was followed by a cooler period (P35-P38, avg 115), but P39-P40 (avg 314) suggests demand is potentially trending upward again as we enter late November (leading into the holiday season for women's lingerie). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 694 units, but could be depleted quickly if another large spike occurs. A pipeline of 642 units is expected in P41. Given the radical shifts between ~100 and ~700 units, I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike average while remaining responsive to the current upturn. For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to reflect the extremely high volatility (standard deviation > 150) which is critical for maintaining an adequate base stock to prevent stockouts during spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P33 (range 100-692). Recent demand (P39-P40) suggests a potential secondary uptrend ahead of the holiday period, following the initial P33-P34 spike.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits extreme demand volatility with periodic spikes followed by relative lulls. We are currently in a high-demand phase (average ~325 units over the last 3 periods: P39-P41) leading into the late November/December holiday period. Given the product is 'Womens Lingerie' (Thong briefs), demand typically increases toward the end of the year. Current on-hand inventory is 988 units with 372 units in-transit (due P45). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for P42-P46 (L+1 = 5 periods). The recent 3-period average is 325.3, while the broader post-P33 average is 263.3. Balancing the risk of stockouts during a potential holiday surge against the holding cost of the current 988 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples to capture the heightened volatility and the recent uptrend (P33-P41), while maintaining a standard sigma to account for the high variance (\u03c3 \u2248 180 in recent periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ascent: Period 39-41 average demand is 325.3, compared to P35-P38 average of 115.5, indicating a pre-holiday ramp-up for the lingerie category.

Daily Reward (R_t): $567.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent demand (P40-P42: 387, 348, 311) confirms a sustained holiday ramp-up for the Womens Lingerie category, averaging ~349 units/period. This is a significant increase from the post-spike low (P35-P38 avg: 115) and aligns with the secondary uptrend noted in Period 41. Although there was a massive spike in P33-P34 (avg 513), the current holiday trend is more stable but elevated. On-hand inventory is 677, and in-transit is 746 (from P41 and P42 orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during the peak holiday season (December), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this updated demand regime (approx 347 units/period) and maintain a higher service level via sigma_hat calculation over the same volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp-up confirmed: Period 40-42 average demand increased to 348.7 units/period (+200% from P35-P38 average of 115.5). Recommend N=4 for demand estimation to capture this stable high-demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak holiday demand period (December). History shows significant demand shifts: a massive spike in Period 33-34 (avg 513) and a recent sustained increase starting Period 39 (P39-P43 average: 310.6 units/period). Given the product category (womens lingerie/underwear) and the date (Dec 9), we anticipate high demand through late December. The current on-hand inventory is 411 units, with 1049 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture the current holiday ramp-up and provide a safety buffer for volatility, I am using recent_N=5 for demand (covering P39-P43) which results in a mean demand estimate of ~310 per period. This covers the lead time + current period (L+1=5) requirement. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the recent spread in demand (range 241-387).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak in progress: Period 39-43 average demand is 310.6 units/period, compared to the preceding P35-P38 average of 115.5 (+169%).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak for the lingerie category. Demand over the last five periods (P40-P44) has averaged 338.4 units per period, showing a significant increase and relative stability compared to the pre-holiday levels. On-hand inventory is low (31 units), with no arrivals in the last three periods, confirming a consistent 4-period lead time. Large orders from P41 (372 units) and P42 (374 units) are expected to arrive in P45 and P46 respectively, which should stabilize the stock. Given the game is nearing its end (Period 47), I am setting mu_hat to capture the current holiday demand mean using the last 5 periods (N=5) and using the default lead time (L=4) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to satisfy the remaining demand without over-ordering as we approach the conclusion.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P40-P44): average demand is 338.4 units/period, showing sustained high volume for the Dec season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Dec 23) for this lingerie SKU. The demand regime from P40-P45 has stabilized at a high level, averaging 341.2 units per period (P40: 387, P41: 348, P42: 311, P43: 266, P44: 380, P45: 360). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is very low at 43 units, but the pipeline (In-transit) is 1304 units, providing some coverage for future periods. However, with the current high-demand regime, a base stock levels must be maintained to avoid stockouts during the remains of the festive season and potential post-holiday sales or returns. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current holiday average (approx. 1706 units for 1+L=5 periods) and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday high-demand regime (P40-P45) confirmed with a mean of 341.2 units/period, representing a significant sustained increase for the December period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1373.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final week of December (2019/12/30). The demand regime for the holiday period (Period 40-46) has been remarkably stable, with an average of 341.2 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 42. Since Period 40, demand hasn't dropped below 266 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for the lingerie category. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 59 units on-hand and high demand expected to continue through the post-holiday/New Year transition, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this specific December high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the base stock reflects the current stable 340+ unit demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility seen during this peak period.
