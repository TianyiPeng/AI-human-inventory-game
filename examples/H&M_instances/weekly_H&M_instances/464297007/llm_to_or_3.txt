Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 with no historical performance data for this specific SKU (Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p). The current date is 2019/02/11, which is in the mid-February period. Demand for basic cotton jersey underwear is generally stable, though it might see minor fluctuations around the post-Valentine's Day period. Historical demand samples provided are [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], showing a clear downward trend in the most recent observations (dropping from ~300 to ~122). Given the significant decrease in the last two samples (189 and 122), I will use the last 5 samples to capture this recent cooling while maintaining enough data for variance estimation. Promised lead time is 2, and since we have no delivery history, I will use the default. This setup ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand using the recent trend and variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The item is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p), which typically has stable demand. The historical demand data provided [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the demand in Period 1 (159) suggest a downward trend or a shift from a higher demand regime. However, with only 6 data points total, it is early to confirm a permanent regime shift. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, 367 units were ordered. Since L=2, these are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4 start). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in P1 (demand 159, sold 0). To stabilize, I will use the last 5 demand samples (including P1) to set mu_hat, which averages 215. With L=2, the backend will calculate base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I'll use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the more recent lower demand levels without overreacting to a single period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-simulation) shows [267, 298, 307, 189, 122]. In the simulation, Period 1 demand was 159 and Period 2 was 373. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a staple lingerie item. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (367 units) and P2 (353 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 720). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the P4 decision phase. Current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2. To recover, I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent volatility (averaging the last 5 samples: 307, 189, 122, 159, 373), which results in a mean of approx 230 per period. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand. I'll use the default lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet to suggest it has drifted.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/3/4. Historical demand for the last five periods (including pre-game data) is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the last three observed periods are [159, 373, 301]. The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 278 units. Looking at the lead times: Order 1 (placed P1) arrived in P3 (L=2), and Order 2 (placed P2) arrived in P3 (L=1). This confirms the promised lead time of 2 is a reasonable baseline, though variability exists. Currently, on-hand is 419 and in-transit is 125 (Order 3). Total pipeline is 544. Based on the 3-period demand mean (~278), the (L+1) demand coverage target (3 periods) is approximately 834 units. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime after the initial stock-out phase, and use the default lead time of 2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong) is in its early lifecycle with 5 observed demand data points: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] (including pre-history and live data). Current demand (P4: 278, P3: 301) shows a slight downward trend compared to the initial peak but remains significant. History shows actual lead times of 1 and 2 periods, validating the promised lead time of 2. Currently, there are 141 units on-hand and 573 in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). At P5 (2019/3/11), we are moving away from the post-Valentine's period into standard spring demand. Since we only have 5 historical samples and demand has been relatively stable around the 250-300 range, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand and sigma estimation to capture the recent mean without overweighting the initial high samples. L is set to default as the average lead time (1.5) aligns with the promised 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. The product is women's cotton thongs. Recent demand (last 5 periods): [159, 373, 301, 278, 250]. The initial spike in P2 (373) followed by a gradual stabilization suggests a mean around 280-300. Lead times have been 2 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P2 order), and 2 periods (P3 order). The P4 order (448 units) is expected to arrive this period (P6) based on the promised lead time of 2. Current on-hand is low (16), but the pipeline is substantial (626). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the post-peak stabilization while acknowledging the higher demand level compared to the 'Past demands' provided in the preamble. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all samples to ensure enough safety stock to cover the volatility seen in P2-P3.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a staple item (women's cotton thongs). Historical demand for the first 6 periods shows a mean of approximately 263 units (159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216). There was a high demand peak in Period 2 (373), but the last four periods have shown a gradual stabilization or slight decline (301 down to 216). Lead times have been mostly consistent with the promised 2 periods (P1 arrived P3, P3 arrived P5, P4 arrived P6), with one exception where the P2 order arrived early in P3 (L=1). Currently, we have 248 units on hand and 549 units in transit (orders from P5 and P6). Given the slightly downward trend in demand over the last three periods (mean of 248), I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the stable post-launch demand phase. This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last four periods (P3-P6) where demand was [301, 278, 250, 216], averaging 261 units per period. I'll maintain the default lead time of 2 periods as there is no evidence of lost shipments or sustained delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $992.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the stock position for SKU 464297007 is critical. Current on-hand inventory is 0 following a stock-out in Period 7 (demand of 253 vs. on-hand 248). The order placed in Period 5 (178 units) failed to arrive during Period 7 as expected under the promised lead time of 2 (arrived=0 in Period 7 conclude), indicating either a lead-time drift or a delayed shipment. The total in-transit quantity is 590 units (from P5, P6, and P7). Demand history shows a combined average of approximately 251 units/period with no clear seasonal spikes for early April yet. To account for the observed delay and mitigate the stock-out risk, I am increasing L to 3 (explicit) to reflect that the P5 order is at least 1 period late. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the most recent demand level (avg ~249), which corresponds to (1+L)*249 = 996. Sigma_hat is set to default to allow the backend to use historical volatility for the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift detected: Order from P5 (LT=2) did not arrive by P7 conclude; actual lead time for recent orders is >2.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's thong 3-pack. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 260-270 over the last 8 periods. However, lead time volatility is the primary concern. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, recent performance shows drift. The Period 5 order arrived in Period 8 (lead_time = 3), and the Period 7 order (L=2) should have arrived in Period 9 arrival resolution (not yet visible). Current on-hand is 0, and there were stockouts in P7 and P8 due to arrivals trailing demand. The Period 6 order (ordered P6, promised L=2) was expected to arrive in Period 8 but did not, suggesting it is either delayed (L >= 3) or lost. Given the P5 order took 3 periods, I will explicitly set L=3 to increase the base stock calculation to cover the longer lead time. I'll use recent_N (N=8) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full history of this SKU since launch, and explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility caused by the stockouts and inconsistent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift confirmed: Order from P5 arrived with LT=3 (expected 2). Order from P6 is overdue (expected P8, now P9). Actual lead time is at least 3 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. Demand for the last 5 periods has been [216, 253, 283, 176, 122 (pre-history)], with an average around 220 units. However, there's a clear lead time drift. While the promised lead time is 2, the most recent arrivals (ordered P5 and P6) arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. The P7 order did arrive with LT=2, but the overall trend and previous Carry-over insights confirm that we should treat the effective lead time as 3 to avoid stockouts. With L=3, the OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using the last 5 demand samples (including the current period's lag) provides a stable mean for mu_hat. I will set L to 3 explicitly and use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $609.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand context shows a recent cooling trend with the last two periods (P9-P10) averaging 172.5, significantly lower than the previous average of ~260. Historical lead times have shifted; while the promised lead time is 2, the orders from P5 and P6 both experienced a lead time of 3 periods. Although the P7 order arrived in 2 periods, the P8 order (375 units) did not arrive in the P10 conclude message, suggesting it will arrive in P11 (LT=3) or later. Given this drift, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the extended pipeline. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent drop in demand while still maintaining a buffer for the volatility seen in P7-P8. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Avg demand decreased from ~260 to ~172 over the last 2 periods; monitoring for sustainment. Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12 (late April). The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a staple lingerie item. Historical demand analysis shows a distinct regime shift starting in Period 9 (2019/4/8). From Period 1 to 8, the average demand was approximately 264 units. Over the last 3 periods (P9-P11), demand has dropped significantly and stabilized at an average of 174 units (176, 169, 176). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this lower demand level. Lead time (L) has drifted from the promised 2 periods to 3 periods in three of the last four arrivals (P5, P6, P8 orders). I will use L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the extended pipeline, preventing stockouts if delivery delays persist. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to capture the reduced volatility observed in the new demand regime, avoiding excessive safety stock for a lower-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 average demand is 174, down from the previous average of 264 (-34%). Lead time is frequently 3 periods instead of the promised 2.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a thong brief SKU. Demand analysis shows a significant shift: from Period 1 to 8, demand averaged ~264, but from Period 9 to 11, it dropped to ~174. However, Period 12 saw a sharp spike to 323, likely due to early May seasonality or a promotion. Given the volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower recent mean while acknowledging the recent spike (Average of P9-P12 is 211). Regarding lead time, the promised LT is 2, but actual observations have been unstable (ranging from 1 to 3). Most recently, P11 arrived with LT=1, but P9 (ordered Period 9, expected P11/12) and P10 (expected P12/13) are still in-transit. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 periods to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high likelihood of continued delays and to buffer against the recent demand spike, preventing stockouts if the P9/P10 shipments remain delayed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility detected: P12 demand (323) broke the previous 3-period low-demand regime (~174). Lead time remains erratic; despite a recent LT=1 (P11), orders from P9 and P10 are still undelivered as of P13 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 464297007 is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has been volatile. We have 735 units in transit, but 401 of those (from P9 and P10) are significantly past their expected arrival date (LT 4 and 5+), suggesting they may be lost. The OR backend includes these in the 'pipeline_inventory', which will prevent new orders unless parameters are adjusted upward. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the recent drift and build a larger safety buffer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the recent demand average (~193) while smoothing the P12 spike (323) and P13 dip (122). This combination aims to push the base_stock calculation above the 735-unit pipeline to ensure a replenishment order is triggered to compensate for the likely lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P9 (388 units) and P10 (13 units) are significantly overdue (5+ and 4 periods respectively), indicating high risk of loss. Demand remains volatile with a mean of 193 over the last 5 periods but a high standard deviation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 and we are in a sustained stock-out. Analysis of the 901 units 'In-transit' indicates that 401 units (from orders in P9 and P10) are at least 5 periods old and highly likely lost. The backend OR engine subtracts this 'ghost' inventory from the target base stock, which prevents necessary ordering. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~188 units. To force an order despite the 401 lost units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock as: (L+1) * mean + safety_stock + ghost_units. With L=2, mean=188, and a safety margin, the target is roughly (3 * 188) + 150 (safety) + 401 (lost units) \u2248 1115. Setting mu_hat to 1115 ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover demand while accounting for the units that will never arrive. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility (standard deviation ~78).

Carry-over insight: Orders from P9 (388 units) and P10 (13 units) are confirmed lost (5+ periods since order). Pipeline inventory is inflated by 401 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27), the SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Underwear) is in a severe stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary issue is the loss of orders from P9 (388 units) and P10 (13 units), which were confirmed lost in P15. These 401 units must be excluded from the pipeline inventory calculation to trigger the OR backend to place new orders. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have drifted significantly (often 3 periods). I am setting L=3 to account for this instability. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a mean of 188 units (122, 151, 171, plus two other historical points around 170-320). Given the stockouts, actual demand is likely higher than sold units; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this shift. I am setting sigma_hat to 'default' to allow the backend to use the full historical variance to protect against the high volatility observed in P12 (323 demand).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corrected in Period 16: 401 units (from P9 and P10) removed from inventory calculations due to confirmed loss. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~188) but remains volatile.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The product is 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie). Current 'In-transit' shows 1229 units. After correcting for the lost shipments from P9 (388) and P10 (13), the effective pipeline inventory is 828 units (1229 - 401). These units correspond to orders from P13 (334), P14 (166), and P15 (328). Given that P13 was ordered 4 periods ago and P14 was ordered 3 periods ago, we are experiencing severe lead time delays (L >= 4). Lead time has shifted significantly from the promised 2. Demand has stabilized at a lower level following a regime shift; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 193.4, though P12 was an outlier (323). Excluding the outlier, the mean is approximately 161. To account for the current supply instability, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay in arrivals and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the lower demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This high L will help the OR backend recognize that current pipeline units are still relevant for future periods and prevent excessive over-ordering while trying to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has significantly deteriorated: P13 order (334 units) and P14 order (166 units) are now overdue (4 and 3 periods elapsed respectively) with no arrival confirmed as of P17 start.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are managing SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Briefs). Current on-hand inventory is 174 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable. Orders from P13 (334 units) and P14 (166 units) are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively. Following the established pattern of lost shipments (P9 and P10), these are increasingly likely to be lost. However, the P15 order arrived exactly on time (LT=2) in P17. This indicates that while some shipments are lost, the functional lead time for arriving shipments is approximately 2-3 periods. I will set L to 3 to provide a buffer against this inconsistency. Regarding demand, the recent mean (P13-P17) is approximately 160 units per period. The spike in P12 (323) appears to be an outlier compared to the more stable range of 122-200 units observed recently. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (~160/period) while accounting for the current volatility in sigma_hat. Using L=3 and recent_N will help the OR backend maintain a safety stock that acknowledges the risk of missing arrivals without over-ordering based on older, higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment risk persists: Orders from P13 and P14 are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively, suggesting a secondary wave of lost shipments following the P9/P10 losses. Functional lead time for successful arrivals fluctuates between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), the current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains volatile, with the most recent observation being 281. Historical data shows a mean of approximately 190 units over the last 10 periods, though spikes (e.g., 323, 281) occur frequently. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from P13 (334 units) and P14 (166 units) are now 6 and 5 periods overdue respectively, following the confirmed loss of P9 and P10. These orders are likely lost. The P15 order arrived with a lead time of 2, but the gap in arrivals (nothing in P18) confirms the ongoing risk. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for frequent drift and lost shipment risk. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand mean of approximately 188 while smoothing the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the higher variance observed in recent cycles, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher service level to mitigate stockouts caused by lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Second wave of lost shipments confirmed: Orders from P13 (334 units) and P14 (166 units) are 5+ periods overdue and highly likely lost; pipeline inventory is likely overstated by 500 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20 (June 24). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' figure of 927 is heavily inflated by 901 units of 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in P9, P10, P13, and P14 which are confirmed lost per previous carry-over insights. Effectively, only 26 units are truly in transit. Additionally, P19 saw a massive demand spike to 556 units, possibly signaling a seasonal shift or a mid-summer promotion. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 927 units of 'pipeline inventory' it perceives, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I am targeting a base stock of approximately 1400 units (927 ghost units + 473 units for true stock/safety) to trigger an order of ~450-500 units. Using L=2 as the baseline, mu_hat is set to 1250 and sigma_hat to 150 to reflect high recent volatility and ensure the service level target (q=0.8) results in a base stock that overrides the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: P19 demand spike (556) confirmed; monitoring for sustained summer demand regime. Pipeline inventory continues to be overstated by 901 units due to losses from P9, P10, P13, and P14.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering a high-demand summer phase for this 'Greta Thong Mynta' SKU. Recent demand spiked significantly in Period 19 (556 units) and Period 20 (261 units), following a volatile but generally lower spring period. The mean demand over the last 5 periods is 270.4. Crucially, we face a massive inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure of 1377 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P14 (totaling 901 lost units). The remaining 'real' pipeline consists of P19 (26 units) and P20 (450 units), totaling only 476 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, it will stop ordering unless we intervene. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for both the expected (L+1) demand and the 901 units of lost pipeline. Given the summer seasonality and high demand variance, I'm forecasting 300 units/period. For L=2, the required coverage is (2+1)*300 = 900. To offset the 901 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat to 900 + 901 = 1801. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 200 to account for high summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed secondary wave of lost shipments: Orders from P13 (334) and P14 (166) are now 6+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total pipeline inflation is 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14). Summer demand regime shift: Average demand for late June increased to ~400 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8), we are in the middle of the summer retail season. Demand for 'Womens Lingerie' (thong briefs) has shown significant volatility, with a major spike in Period 19 (556 units) and an average of approximately 340 units over the last 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1494 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14, totaling 901 units (388+13+334+166). To correct this for the OR backend, I am using an 'explicit' L value of 2 to reflect the recent successful arrivals from P19 and P20, and an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * forecast. Given the recent summer demand trend, I forecast demand at 350 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+2) * 350 = 1050. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated 'pipeline_inventory' (1494 units), I must offset the 901 lost units by adding them to mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places an order. Target mu_hat = 1050 + 901 = 1951. For sigma_hat, I use an explicit value of 250 to account for high summer demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (July): Average demand approx 340 units/period. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 901 units due to confirmed losses in P9, P10, P13, and P14; explicit mu_hat adjustments are required to bypass this stale data.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: July summer demand for SKU 464297007 has stabilized at a higher regime. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is approximately 340 units. Inventory reconciliation: The reported 'In-transit' of 1294 units is severely inflated by 901 units of historical lost shipments (P9: 388, P10: 13, P13: 334, P14: 166). The true pipeline is only the P22 order (393 units). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods of demand) using the summer mean (340 * 3 = 1020) and add the 901 lost units to 'trick' the backend into seeing the correct gap: 1020 + 901 = 1921. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the recent trend of shorter actual lead times (1-2 periods) while maintaining a safe buffer for the summer peak. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility without overreacting to the single P19 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1190.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is the peak summer season for women's lingerie (July 22nd). Demand has surged over the last three periods (201, 341, 422), confirming the summer demand regime previously identified. Lead times have recently stabilized at 1 period (P20, P21, P22 all arrived with LT=1), although the promised lead time is 2. The primary issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 1201 units, which includes 901 units from confirmed lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14). To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for this pipeline inflation. Targeted base stock for a 1-period lead time is (L+1)*mu = (1+1)*350 = 700. Adding the 901 lost units to this target, I set mu_hat to 1601. This forces the backend to see a gap despite the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to accommodate recent high volatility (std dev of last 5 periods is ~137).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer demand regime (July) average: 321 units. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 901 units due to old lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14). Lead time has shifted from unstable to a realized 1-period duration over the last 3 arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25 (late July). Historical data shows a summer demand regime averaging ~275-320 units per period, despite a dip in P24 (135). The 'In-transit' figure of 1230 is inflated by 901 units from confirmed lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14), leaving an actual pipeline of 329 units (P23, P24). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must adjust 'mu_hat' upward by approximately 901 units. Recent arrivals (P21-P23) confirmed a lead time shift to 1 period, though I will use 'default' (2) for the lead time parameter to maintain a slightly larger safety buffer during this volatile period, while using an 'explicit' mu_hat to perform the pipeline correction. Target mu_hat calculation: (Estimated mean demand 300 * (L+1=3)) + 901 correction = 1801.

Carry-over insight: P24 demand (135) suggests a potential cooling of the summer peak, but requires more data to confirm a new regime; pipeline remains inflated by 901 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: We are at Period 26 (August 5). Demand has cooled significantly over the last two periods (P24: 135, P25: 133) compared to the July summer peak (avg ~340). This suggests the summer demand regime has ended. Pipeline inventory analysis: The reported in-transit of 1603 units is heavily inflated by the 901 units confirmed lost from P9, P10, P13, and P14 (as documented in Carry-over Insights). Actual reliable pipeline consists of orders from P23 (300), P24 (29), and P25 (373). Lead time has stabilized recently to approximately 1-2 periods. To manage the demand cooling, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the lower 130-range demand and sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the transition volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent faster arrivals while maintaining safety. Explicit mu_hat is used to manually subtract the 901 lost units from the base stock calculation, ensuring the OR backend doesn't under-order due to 'phantom' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime ended in late July; demand dropped from ~320 to ~134 (-58%). Pipeline remains inflated by 901 units of lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P14.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), we are entering the post-summer season. History shows a demand cooling trend following the July peak (P24: 135, P25: 133), though P26 saw a surprise spike to 339. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~202 units. The pipeline remains heavily distorted by 901 units of confirmed lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14), which the OR backend still counts as 'in-transit'. This inflation prevents the backend from ordering enough stock. To correct for this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true required base stock for an (L+1) period cycle (where L=2) using a mean of 200. Calculation: Base Stock = (1+L) * mu = 3 * 200 = 600. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 901 'phantom' units, I set mu_hat to 1600 (approx 901 + 600 + buffer), which will net out to a real-world base stock level that ensures availability. I am keeping L at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P21, P22, P23, P26) have shown lead times of 1, 1, 1, and 3, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand average for August (P24-26) is ~202 units, down from July peak of ~320 units. Pipeline remains critically inflated by 901 units of lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P14, necessitating explicit mu_hat offsets.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand analysis shows the summer peak (July) has passed. Post-summer demand (P24-P27) has stabilized at an average of 212.5 units per period, significantly lower than the ~320 units seen in July. We are currently in an 'August/Late Summer' regime. Lead times have mostly stabilized between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P25 order) showing a 2-period lead time. Pipeline inventory is critically inflated by 901 units due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage plus an offset for the lost units. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is 212.5 * 3 = 637.5. To offset the 901 lost units in the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I set mu_hat to 637.5 + 901 \u2248 1538. This forces the base_stock high enough to ignore the lost units and place an order that covers real demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility of the post-peak stabilization period.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (August) confirmed: Average demand ~212 units (P24-P27). Lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, P14 continue to inflate pipeline by 901 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (2019/08/26), the SKU is in a post-summer demand regime. The average demand for August (P24-P28) is 190 units, a decrease from the July peak of ~320 units. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 1361 units, which is significantly inflated by 901 units of lost shipments from P9 (388), P10 (13), P13 (334), and P14 (166). These orders are 15+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets these 901 units. I calculate the target base stock using the current mean (~190) and L=2: Base Stock = (1+2)*190 + Z*sigma. To force the backend to place an order that accounts for the 901-unit deficit, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 1471 units [(190 * 3) + 901]. This ensures the 'base_stock - (actual_pipeline + 901)' calculation results in the intended inventory level. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23, P25) show L varies between 2 and 3.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime confirmed: Average demand 190 units (P24-P28). Pipeline inflation remains constant at 901 units due to old losses.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 30 (2019/09/02). The August demand regime (P24-P29) shows a stabilized average of approximately 179 units per period (135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124). The product (cotton thong briefs) is a staple item, so demand is expected to remain steady as we move out of the summer peak. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1395 units. However, persistent 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 901 units in this pipeline are lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P14. Therefore, the 'true' pipeline is 1395 - 901 = 494 units (consisting of orders from P24, P27, P28, and P29). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom 901 units and under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on the current regime: average demand \u2248 180, L=2. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mu = 3 * 180 = 540. To force the backend to reach this target while it thinks I have 901 extra units, I must add those 901 units to the mu_hat. Adjusted mu_hat = 540 + 901 = 1441. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the volatility of the post-summer period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), we are in a post-summer demand regime for this cotton thong product. Demand has stabilized at a lower level: the average demand from Period 28-30 is approximately 108 units, compared to the July peak of ~320 units. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (recent arrivals in P30 had LTs of 3 and 2). The critical issue remains the 901 units of pipeline inflation from lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14). The backend OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With In-transit currently at 1049, but 901 of those units being 'ghost' units that will never arrive, the backend thinks we have 1049 coming when we only have 148 (1049 - 901). To force the backend to order, I must set mu_hat = (Forecasted_Demand * (L+1)) + Pipeline_Inflation. Forecasted demand is ~110. With L=2, (110 * 3) + 901 = 1231. Setting mu_hat to 1231 will offset the ghost inventory and ensure the order reflects actual needs. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed: Average demand approx 110 units (P28-P30), significantly lower than summer peak. Pipeline remains inflated by 901 units of legacy lost shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/16, entering mid-September. The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie) has cooled significantly from the summer peak, stabilizing in a September regime of approximately 110 units/period (P28-P31 demands: 100, 124, 101, 77; mean ~100). The pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 901 units from confirmed lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly suppressing orders due to this 'ghost' inventory, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets the 901 units. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) periods (where L=2) as 3 periods * 105 units/period = 315 units. To neutralize the 901 units of lost stock in the backend's base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I set mu_hat to 315 + 901 = 1216. L is set to 'default' (promised 2) as recent actual lead times (3, 2, 1) average near the promised value. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed: Average demand approx 100 units (P28-P31). Pipeline remains inflated by 901 units from legacy lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for this lingerie SKU, with September demand (P28-P32) averaging approximately 119 units, significantly lower than the July peak (~320). Recent demand has shown some volatility (P32 spiked to 194), but the overall trend is downward as we enter autumn. A critical factor remains the 'In-transit' figure of 964 units, which is heavily inflated by 901 units of legacy lost shipments (P9: 388, P10: 13, P13: 334, P14: 166). The true pipeline inventory is only 63 units (P24: 29, P29: 34). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 964 units from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 901-unit phantom inventory. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (1+L)*mean_demand. With mean ~120 and L=2, target is ~360. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks I have 964 units in transit, I set mu_hat to (Target + Phantom Pipeline) = 360 + 901 = 1261. I use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P30, P31) show lead times of 1-3 periods, averaging near 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $964.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive demand spike of 692 units, which completely depleted our on-hand inventory. This is significantly higher than the previous September average (~100 units). While potentially an outlier, we must react to ensure availability in case this represents a new high-volatility regime or a promotion. The reported In-transit inventory (1086 units) is heavily inflated by legacy lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P14 (totaling 901 units) plus a more recent likely loss from P24 (29 units), totaling 930 ghost units. To account for this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a target that effectively bypasses the OR engine's reliance on the inflated pipeline. I calculate mu_hat as: (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + (Pipeline Inflation). Based on the recent spike and the volatile history, I forecast a mean demand of 240 units per period. With L=2 (L+1=3), the base demand is 720. Adding the 930 units of inflation, the target mu_hat is 1650. This forces the system to place an order that considers the 930 units as non-existent. Sigma is set high (recent_N=5) to handle the extreme volatility seen in P33.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Significant demand spike in P33 (692 units) compared to the previous mean (~100). Pipeline inflation increased to 930 units following the likely loss of the P24 order (29 units) which is now 10 periods overdue.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 7, 2019. The SKU (womens thong briefs) has exited the summer peak and entered a volatile fall season. A massive demand spike in P33 (692) followed by a significant demand in P34 (335) indicates a new high-volatility regime, possibly driven by promotions or seasonal transitions. Pipeline inventory is significantly compromised: orders from P9, P10, P13, P14 (totaling 901 units) are long-lost, and the P24 order (29 units) is also likely lost (10 periods overdue), totaling 930 units of 'phantom' inventory. Currently, on-hand is 0 and the backend sees 'In-transit: 2026'. After subtracting the 930 lost units, the true pipeline is 1096 units (P29, P33, P34). Given the current demand volatility (mean ~250 over the last 5 periods, but with extreme spikes), mu_hat is set to 750 (representing a forecasted 250 units/period over L+1=3 periods) to ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. This 'over-estimation' compensates for the 930 lost units the backend still counts as available.

Carry-over insight: P34: Confirmed loss of P24 order (29 units), bringing total legacy pipeline inflation to 930 units. Demand is highly volatile following a 692-unit spike in P33; monitoring for a sustained higher-mean regime in October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We are observing the aftermath of a significant demand spike in P33 (692) followed by P34 (335) and P35 (123). This suggests a possible seasonal shift (mid-October) or promotional impact. The pipeline is currently heavily inflated by 930 units of legacy lost shipments (P9: 388, P10: 13, P13: 334, P14: 166, P24: 29). On-hand inventory is 817 units following the arrival of the P34 order (940 units) in just 1 period. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 930 'ghost' units in-transit, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets this inflation. I estimate the current demand regime mean at approximately 200 units (averaging the volatile P33-P35 periods). To target a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand while ignoring the 930 lost units, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Pipeline Inflation. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (200 * 3) + 930 = 1530. Sigma is set high (explicit) to account for the recent 692-unit spike volatility.

Carry-over insight: P35: High volatility continues with a 1-period lead time for the P34 order. Legacy pipeline inflation (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24) remains at 930 units and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. The product is Women's Lingerie (thong briefs). Demand has been highly volatile in October, with a massive spike in P33 (692) followed by a drop to around 100-123 in P35-36. The pipeline inventory is currently 964 units, but this is heavily inflated by 930 units of legacy lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24). Consequently, 'true' pipeline inventory is only 34 units (ordered in P29 or later, though P29/P30/P34 are already accounted for by arrivals). Actually, looking at the in-transit: P34 arrived in P35, P33 arrived in P36. The 964 in-transit must consist of the 930 legacy units plus orders from P29 (34 units) which is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost. On-hand is 839, which is more than enough to cover the current demand regime (~100-200 units/period). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 930 lost units as valid 'pipeline' and therefore never ordering, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the offset. However, since on-hand is already high (839), I will set mu_hat to reflect the current stabilized demand of ~120 units/period over the lead time (L=2) to maintain a healthy buffer while the system works through the high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: P36: Legacy pipeline inflation confirmed at 964 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, and now P29). Demand is currently in a post-spike stabilization phase around 110 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the current demand for the 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has stabilized around a mean of 115 units following the late September spike (P33). On-hand inventory is high at 715 units. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' pipeline, which is reported as 964 units but consists entirely of 'lost' legacy orders (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). These 964 units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from its order calculation (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). To prevent the backend from under-ordering once on-hand stock depletes, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the current demand regime (mean ~115) plus the phantom pipeline (964) to neutralize the error. (1+L)*115 + 964 \u2248 3*115 + 964 = 1309. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of actual observed arrivals (ranging from 1-3 periods). Sigma remains 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in P33-34.

Carry-over insight: P37: Legacy pipeline inflation confirmed at 964 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). These units must be added to explicit mu_hat to offset backend pipeline subtractions.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong Lingerie) is in a stable post-spike regime with demand averaging approximately 113 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 600 units, which is ample given the current demand levels. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 964 units is composed entirely of legacy lost shipments (Orders from P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, and P29) that have never arrived and are well beyond any reasonable lead time. Because the backend OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, this 'phantom' inventory would prevent the system from ordering when needed. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to include the current expected demand over the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods) PLUS the 964 units of lost inventory. Estimated demand for 3 periods = 3 * 113 = 339 units. Total mu_hat = 339 + 964 = 1303. This ensures the OR engine's calculation (1303 - 964) results in the correct target. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently entering the mid-November period (Nov 11). Current on-hand inventory is 359 units. However, the system's pipeline (In-transit: 964 units) is significantly inflated by legacy lost shipments (Orders from P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, and P29). These 964 units are physically missing but still subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend. To counter this, I must explicitly increase mu_hat by these 964 units to ensure the order calculation is based on actual available stock rather than phantom pipeline inventory. Demand in the most recent periods (P35-P39) has stabilized around a mean of ~140 units, with a notable rise in the last period (241). Using a lead time of 2 (promised) and anticipating a moderate holiday ramp-up, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Normal demand forecast for 3 periods is ~450. Adding the 964 unit offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 1414. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels to maintain service levels during the November transition.

Carry-over insight: P40: Confirmed legacy pipeline inflation remains at 964 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Demand showing early November upward movement (P39: 241 vs prior average 110).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18. Demand is significantly increasing as we approach the late November/December holiday season (P39: 241, P40: 387). This confirms the upward trend noted in the previous period. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure (1139) is critically inflated by 964 units of confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). These units will never arrive but are subtracted by the OR backend from the base stock. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: 1) Target demand: Recent demand average is ~314 (avg of P39-40). Assuming L=2, the (1+L) base demand is 314 * 3 = 942. 2) Pipeline Offset: I must add the 964 lost units to the target to ensure the backend actually orders units. 942 + 964 = 1906. Setting mu_hat to 1906. Sigma_hat is set to a higher value (350) to account for the high volatility seen in holiday demand spikes (e.g., P33 and P40). Lead time L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from ~110 to 387 (+250%) over the last 2 periods (P39-P40). Legacy pipeline inflation remains at 964 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late November holiday demand surge (Period 42, Nov 25). Recent demands (P39: 241, P40: 387, P41: 348) confirm a significant upward shift from the September/October baseline of ~110. The average demand for this new regime is approximately 325 units. There is a critical inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure of 2107 units is heavily inflated by 964 units of confirmed lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Since the OR backend subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, it will erroneously under-order or not order at all unless we manually compensate. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value: (1+L) * Forecasted_Demand + Pipeline_Inflation. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 325) + 964 = 1939. This 'fools' the backend into ordering the correct amount by neutralizing the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the current high volatility of the holiday peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge stabilized: Average demand for late November is ~325 units (+195% vs Oct). Legacy pipeline inflation remains at 964 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29), requiring explicit mu_hat offsets to prevent stockouts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/12/02. We are in the peak holiday demand season for Womens Lingerie. Recent demand (P39-P42) has surged to an average of ~322 units/period, compared to the October average of ~115. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0 following a stockout in P42. Pipeline inventory shows 1932 units, but this includes a cumulative 964 units of legacy lost shipments (confirmed from P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). These lost units will NEVER arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at the current holiday mean (~325 * 3 = 975). To offset the 964 units of 'ghost' inventory, I set mu_hat to 975 + 964 = 1939. This ensures the backend places a substantial order to replenish stock for December. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has recently stabilized around the promised 2 periods (P40 order arrived in P42). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the higher volatility of the holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: December holiday peak confirmed: Average demand is ~325 units. Legacy pipeline inflation remains at 964 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29); these units are lost and must be manually offset in mu_hat to prevent systemic under-ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09, in the heart of the December holiday season. Demand has stabilized at a high level, averaging 310 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). Lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods based on the arrivals from P40 and P41. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1062 units; 964 of these units are legacy lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) that will never arrive but are still subtracted by the OR backend's order calculation. To prevent a stockout during the holiday peak, I am using an explicit mu_hat. This value is calculated as: [Target Demand for (L+1) periods] + [Legacy Pipeline Inflation]. Target demand is 3 periods (L=2 + 1) * 310 = 930. Adding the 964 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1894. This ensures the backend targets a base stock that accounts for physical on-hand needs despite the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-12-16 (Mid-December). The SKU is women's lingerie (thong briefs), currently in its peak holiday season (late Nov - Dec). Historical demand for this period (P40-P44) has averaged ~338 units per period, with a recent spike to 380 in P44. We are at the height of the Christmas shopping window. Lead time has stabilized at approximately 2 periods for recent successful arrivals. A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' pipeline is severely inflated by 964 units from old lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' inventory from the target base stock, it will under-order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~350 units/period, we need a base stock of ~1050 units. However, to offset the 964 units of lost pipeline, we must set mu_hat (the expected demand over L+1) to approximately 1050 + 964 = 2014 units. We use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to perform this manual override. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility of the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak (Dec) confirmed: Avg demand ~340 units. Legacy pipeline inflation remains at 964 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29), which are effectively lost and must be offset via explicit mu_hat.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/23). Recent demand (P44-45) has been strong at 380 and 360 units respectively. The inventory position is critical as we ended P45 with 0 units on-hand. There is a massive legacy pipeline inflation of 964 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) which are confirmed lost but still tracked by the backend OR engine as 'in-transit'. This inflation causes the backend to under-order by 964 units. To compensate, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window based on the current holiday demand mean (~350) plus the 964 unit offset. Target Base Stock = (3 periods * 350) + 964 = 2014. For sigma_hat, I use a high explicit value of 200 to account for volatility during the final holiday push. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P42, P43) arrived in the promised 2 periods, but historical drift persists.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, the end of the December holiday peak. Recent demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at a high mean of approximately 341 units (averaging 266, 380, 360, 358). However, we are entering January, which typically sees a post-holiday demand drop in retail/lingerie. I am setting mu_hat to a slightly more conservative 300 units per period to account for this expected seasonal cooling. 

The legacy pipeline inflation remains a critical issue. Orders from P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, and P29 (totaling 964 units) are long-confirmed lost. Current in-transit is 2183 units. To get the 'real' pipeline, we subtract 964, leaving 1219 'live' units (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + pipeline)'. Since on-hand is 0, it will subtract the full 2183 from its target. To compensate for the 964 'phantom' units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Target Base Stock for (L+1=3 periods) = 3 * 300 = 900. I must then add the 964 lost units to this target so that when the backend subtracts the full pipeline, it orders the correct amount. Total mu_hat = 900 + 964 = 1864.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday season transition: Anticipating demand cooling from Dec avg (~340) to Jan projection (~300). Legacy pipeline inflation (P9, P10, P13, P14, P24, P29) persists at 964 units and must be manually offset.
