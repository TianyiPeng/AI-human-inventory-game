Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a staple lingerie item with relatively stable demand, though potentially affected by base seasonal trends. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (267, 298, 307, 189, 122) shows a significant downward trend in the most recent two periods. The mean of the last 5 periods is 236.6. Given the promised lead time of 4, our base_stock must cover 1+4=5 periods of demand. Calculating mu_hat (expected demand over review + lead time): Using the mean of all 5 samples (236.6) gives (1+4)*236.6 = 1183. However, the recent drop (189, 122) suggests a regime change or seasonal decline following a peak. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent variance while not over-reacting to the single lowest point (122), allowing the capped policy to manage the replenishment safety buffer. Initial L is set to default (promised 4).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 367 units, which are currently in-transit. Since on-hand inventory was 0, we had a stockout (demand 159, sold 0). Historical demand samples are [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], and the most recent demand in Period 1 was 159. The mean of all 6 samples [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159] is 223.66. With L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods (1+L). mu_hat (default) would be 5 * 223.66 = 1118.3. I will stick with the default parameters as there is not yet enough evidence of a sustained demand shift or lead-time deviation (actual lead time for the P1 order won't be known until P5 or P6).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Historical demand data shows a significant spike from 159 in P1 to 373 in P2, with a previous history mean around 217. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, as the initial orders from P1 and P2 (totaling 719 units in-transit) are scheduled to arrive based on a 4-period promised lead time (expected arrival in P5 and P6 respectively). Since we have 0 'conclude' messages showing arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the recent samples [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373] average 245. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent fluctuations (avg ~210), while keeping L=4. This ensures the base stock (L+1=5 periods of demand) is approximately 1050 units, aiming to recover service levels once shipments start arriving.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's cotton lace thong briefs. Current period is P4. On-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 (and will be visible in the P5 conclude message read at P6). Historical demand samples are [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] from before the simulation, and [159, 373, 301] during the simulation. Average demand across all 8 samples is approximately 252. Since lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Using 'default' for mu_hat will compute (1+4) * 252.1 = 1260.6. Given we have 1124 units in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will order approximately 136 units to reach the base stock, subject to the cap. This is a conservative approach while waiting for the first shipment to arrive to confirm lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (basic underwear), which typically has stable demand, though the observed demand in the first 4 periods (159, 373, 301, 278) averaged 277.75, slightly higher than the pre-history average of 221.2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Pipeline inventory is 1423 units (sum of orders from P1-P4). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (incorporating the most recent 4 data points plus 1 from the immediate past history) to capture the slightly higher recent demand trend while maintaining a base stock level that accounts for the current pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the last 10 periods (including pre-game) is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373, 301, 278, 250]. The mean over these 10 periods is approximately 254.4. Lead time evidence from the Period 5 conclusion confirms the promised lead time (P1 order arrived in P5, L=4). Currently, we have 117 units on hand and 1062 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy to target (L+1) periods of demand. Since L=4, it targets 5 periods of demand (approx 1272 units). With a pipeline of 1062 + 117 = 1179, the system is slightly under-stocked but has significant incoming volume. I will use the recent 10 demand points (recent_N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand regime, and stick with the default lead time of 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Greta Thong Mynta), a staple item in Womens Lingerie. Analysis of demand shows an initial spike (300+ units in Periods 2-3) followed by a stabilization between 216-250 units in the most recent periods (P5-P6). Historical demand samples [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] from before the game started show a declining trend, but the in-game mean is approx 263. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of approximately 283 units/period (average of P2-P6). Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the arrival of P1 and P2 orders in P5 and P6 respectively. In-transit inventory is high (947 units: P3, P4, P5, P6 orders), which covers nearly 4 periods of demand. On-hand is 253. With L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods (L+1). Current total (OH 253 + IT 947 = 1200) covers roughly 4.2 periods at 283 demand. The OR backend will likely place a small adjustment order to reach the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Demand stabilizing around 250-280 units/period after early-season volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' shows demand stabilization. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is [301, 278, 250, 216, 253], averaging 259.6 units. The confirmed lead time L = 4 matches the promised lead time (P1, P2, and P3 orders arrived exactly at P(N+4)). With On-hand=405 and In-transit=872 (comprising orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), we are well-covered.mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary demand mean of ~260 over the (1+L)=5 period window (Total target mu_hat \u2248 1300). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility without being skewed by the very high demand in P2 (373). This approach maintains a high service level while managing holding costs as inventory begins to accumulate.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). Analysis of the last 4 concluded periods (P5-P8) confirms the actual lead time is 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has stabilized following an initial volatile period (P2 and P3 saw demands of 373 and 301). Over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), demand has been 250, 216, 253, and 283, averaging 250.5. With a lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. Our target base stock, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (75% service level / critical ratio is 4/(4+1)=0.8), should be based on this recent stable demand. I will use the recent_N method (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the early demand spikes (P1-P3) would otherwise inflate the safety stock and mean inappropriately. Current pipeline inventory (655) and on-hand (421) totals 1076 units, which is ample for the next few periods, but we must maintain the cycle to prevent stockouts once these arrivals clear.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized from Period 5 onwards: mean is 250.5 units/period (std dev approx 28) for the range P5-P8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/15. Historical demand analysis shows an initial volatile period (P1-P4) followed by a more stabilized regime. In the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has been [250, 216, 253, 283, 176], with a mean of 235.6 and a standard deviation of 41.5. The most recent demand (P9) was quite low (176), possibly suggesting a softening trend or late spring variability. The lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on five consecutive arrived shipments (P5-P9). I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this more stable recent demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent dip in demand with the prior stability to avoid over-reacting to a single low data point while maintaining a safe service level (z-score for $4 profit vs $1 holding cost is ~0.84, or roughly 80th percentile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) is showing a demand decline over the last two periods (P9: 176, P10: 169) compared to the previous stable range of 250-280 units. This suggests a shift in the demand regime, possibly seasonal as we move further into spring (April). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5 through P10). Since the product has a relatively high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), and the current on-hand inventory (319) plus in-transit stock (767) is high relative to recent demand levels, I am adjusting the demand forecast downward. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent high ending inventory and the softening demand trend (average of last 4 periods is ~220 units). This should signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 9: average demand dropped from ~250 to ~172 units (-31%) over the last two recorded periods (P9-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (late April), we are observing a sustained demand downturn. The initial demand of ~250-280 units/period seen in March (Period 5-8) has dropped significantly to an average of 173.7 units over the last three periods (P9: 176, P10: 169, P11: 176). This shift coincides with the post-Easter period in April. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand 473 + In-transit 559 = 1032) is very high relative to this new demand regime, covering approximately 6 periods of stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on history (P1-P7 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Therefore, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering while maintaining the promised lead time parameter L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: sustained drop from ~250 to ~174 units/period (average over P9-P11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand spiked significantly to 323 units, which contradicts the downward trend (approx. 174 units/period) observed from Period 9 to 11. Historically, early demand (P1-P4) was also high, suggesting that the lower demand in April might have been a temporary dip rather than a permanent regime shift. Period 12's spike might be related to early May seasonal factors or a return to the early-game mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high inventory on hand (232) and in-transit (477), the pipeline of 709 units covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand at the higher rate. To avoid over-ordering while respecting the recent volatility, I will use a larger N=8 for demand estimation to capture both the low April periods and the higher demand periods, and use recent_N for sigma to account for the increased variance (standard deviation between ~169 and ~323 covers a wide range).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 12 with a spike to 323 units, countering the previous downward trend of ~174 units/period seen in P9-P11. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has shown significant volatility recently, moving from a low-demand regime (~174 units in P9-P11) to a spike of 323 (P12) and then a drop to 122 (P13). Given this is a 3-pack cotton lace thong (staple underwear), demand is likely anchored to a mean with occasional promotional or seasonal variance. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 212.8 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 339 and in-transit at 572, the total pipeline is 911 units. This covers roughly 4.2 periods of demand at the 5-period average. To prevent overstocking during the current volatile phase while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent 5-period average (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the elevated volatility (std dev ~84).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly (Range: 122-323) between P12-P13; 5-period average (P9-P13) is 212.8 units/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory review for Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is cotton-lace thongs, which are generally non-seasonal basics, but we are seeing significant demand variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). A recent demand regime shift was noted starting Period 9; however, the last few periods (P12-P14: 323, 122, 151) show high volatility compared to the P9-P11 stability (~174). Measuring the mean and standard deviation over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) provides a balanced forecast: mean = (176+169+176+323+122+151)/6 = 186.1. Using N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this recent volatility surge while respecting the overall downward shift from the early season peak. Mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*186.1, and sigma_hat will reflect the heightened variance (stdev \u2248 74) across the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after Period 12; mean demand for P9-P14 is 186 units/period with significant variance (std dev ~74).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong Briefs) is experiencing a period of high demand volatility. Since Period 9 (late spring), demand has ranged from 122 to 323 units per period. The recent 5-period average (P11-P15) is 188.6 units, but the high standard deviation (~74 over P9-P14) suggests we must maintain a robust safety stock. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (promised = actual). Given current inventory (265 units) and substantial in-transit orders (627 units), we are well-covered for the short term. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering P9-P15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and its associated volatility. This aims to balance the service level for potential spikes (like the 323 in P12) while acknowledging the average has trended lower than the early-season levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile but the lower-level regime is confirmed: Mean demand P9-P15 is 191.4 units/period with continued high variance.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a zero arrival for an order placed in Period 12. However, checking the history for Period 12, the order quantity was 0. This clarifies that no shipment was actually lost; the system is behaving as expected with a stable lead time of 4 periods. The demand for Period 16 was 200 units, which is consistent with the volatile but lower-level regime observed since P9. Since P9, demands have been: 176, 169, 176, 323, 122, 151, 171, 200. Calculating the mean of these last 8 periods (P9-P16) gives 186 units. Given the high variance (spike of 323 and dip of 122), I will continue using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this most recent volatile regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9 to 16 confirmed: mean 186 units/period with high volatility (range 122-323). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) shows a sustained demand regime that began around Period 9. The current period is June 10, typically transitioning into a stable summer period for lingerie basics. Analysis of the demand history from Period 9 to 17 shows a mean demand of approximately 188 units/period (Calculated: [176, 169, 176, 323, 122, 151, 171, 200, 154]) with considerable volatility (std dev ~56), largely driven by a single outlier in Period 12 (323 units). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the exception of the Period 12 order (value 0, which logically hasn't 'arrived'), resulting in a pipeline gap in Period 16. The arrival in Period 17 (324 units from Period 13) confirms lead time remains 4. To balance the relatively low profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which implies a target service level around 80%, I will focus on the most recent 9 periods (the Period 9 regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures both the lowered mean and the increased volatility observed recently.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Historically, lead time (L) has been consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P13 and P14 orders arriving in P17 and P18 respectively). The order from Period 12 (0 units) logically resulted in 0 arrivals in Period 16. Demand from Period 9 to Period 18 has averaged 189 units/period, but with significant volatility (std dev ~58). Specifically, the last two periods (P17-P18) showed demand of 154 and 281, suggesting that while the long-term average is lower than the initial weeks, spikes still occur. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower but volatile demand regime (P9-P18). This N value encompasses the entire identified secondary regime. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for a 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1028.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand spiked significantly to 556 units, compared to the previous stabilized mean of ~186-191 units. This spike (June 17) likely corresponds to seasonal lingerie demand or a mid-summer promotion. This surge drained all on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. Although the carry-over insights previously suggested a lower-level regime, the last two periods (281 and 556) indicate a significant upward trend or seasonal peak. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period, I will adjust mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P17-P19 average = 330) and increase sigma_hat based on this recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, although the order from Period 12 is unaccounted for (ordered 0 units, so 'arrived=0' in P16 is expected).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 18-19: demand increased from averaging ~190 to 556 in P19 (+190% vs recent mean). This likely indicates a seasonal summer peak for this category.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand phase likely corresponding to the summer season (July start). Period 19 saw a significant demand surge to 556 units, followed by 261 units in Period 20 (where sales were stock-out limited). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a large pipeline exists. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current goal is to replenish stock rapidly to capture this summer surge. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the recent surge (P18-P20 average demand is approx 366). Using N=3 for mu_hat captures this spike better than a longer average. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the high volatility observed since the end of the previous stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked to 556 in P19 and remained high (stock-out at 261 units sales) in P20. Expected mean demand for the high season is ~350-400 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $803.00

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer period (early July), following a significant demand surge in June (P19 demand: 556). Recent periods show a stock-out constrained demand (P20 sold 149 units with 0 ending inventory, P21 sold 201 units with 1 ending inventory). The previous 'Period 21' demand was likely suppressed by low on-hand inventory. Given the product is light underwear (thong briefs), the summer seasonality is a primary driver. I am setting mu_hat conservatively using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the high-demand shift from P19-P21 (average demand ~339), while acknowledge that the 'OR backend' will use its internal service-level logic based on this mean. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since demand variability has increased with the surge, 'sigma_hat' is set via 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the current volatility. Our goal is to rebuild safety stock to prevent further lost sales during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand spiked significantly in June/July (P19-P21). Observed demand average in this 3-period window is 339 units/period, despite stock-outs limiting sales in P20 and P21.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer peak for this SKU (Greta Thong), with recent demand observations of 556, 261, 201, and 341. Stock-outs occurred in Period 19, 20, and 22, meaning true demand is likely higher than sold units. The average demand across this peak (P19-P22) is approximately 340 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P18 order in P22. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1923 units in-transit. To capture the summer peak while accounting for the significant volatility (range 201 to 556+), I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1700 ((1 + 4) * 340). I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 250 (roughly sqrt(5) * 110) to account for the high variance observed during this surge, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock level to prevent further stock-outs during the peak season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (July) for this lingerie/underwear item. Demand has escalated significantly since P19, with recent figures being 556, 261 (stock-out), 201 (nearly stocked out), 341 (stock-out), and 422 (stock-out). The True Mean (\u03bc) for this summer regime is likely between 400 and 500 units per period. In Period 23, we saw demand of 422 units while only 295 were available. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand, but there is a large pipeline of 1628 units (including major orders from P20 and P21). The order from Period 20 (669 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 24 (viewable in P25). To handle the summer peak, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate mean demand at 450 units/period (\u03bc_hat = (1+L)*450 = 2250) with L=4. Volatility remains high due to stock-out data clipping, so I've set sigma_hat explicitly to capture the spread (sqrt(1+4)*100 \u2248 223). The OR backend will order if the pipeline (1628) falls below the base stock (~2500), ensuring we cover potential demand while accounting for the massive incoming shipments.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand from Period 19-23 averages >400 units/period when accounting for lost sales due to stock-outs. Pipeline inventory is currently high (1628 units) awaiting arrival of P20-P22 orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history reflects a high-volatility summer peak. Demand spiked in P19 (556) and remained high through P23 (422), but dropped significantly in P24 (135), which could signal the end of the seasonal peak or just high variance. The average demand from the start of the surge (P19-P24) is approximately 319 units per period. However, given the product is cotton thong briefs (a staple) and we are moving into late July, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the higher summer average while acknowledging the recent drop. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1-P20). With on-hand inventory at 534 and a large pipeline of 1593 units (from P21-P24), the 'cap' logic in the OR backend will likely limit current ordering to prevent overstocking as the season potentially wanes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the summer peak; Period 24 saw a sharp drop to 135 units after several periods of high demand (>400 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-480.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering August (P26), following a confirmed summer peak (P19-P23) where demand frequently exceeded 400 units. However, demand in P24 and P25 dropped significantly to 135 and 133 units, respectively. This suggests the high-growth summer regime has ended, and demand is reverting to a baseline, possibly slightly lower than the spring average or stabilizing around the the long-term historical mean. On-hand inventory is currently high at 1012 units, and pipeline inventory is 982 (orders from P22 and P24). Since actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, order from P22 is expected to arrive in P26 conclude, and P24 in P28 conclude. To avoid excessive holding costs during this post-peak cooling phase, I will utilize the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the transition from the peak (P19-P23) to the current lower demand (P24-P25). This results in a balanced forecast of approx 277 units/period across the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the high volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand correction: Demand dropped from >400 units (P19-P23) to ~134 units (P24-P25), indicating the seasonal peak has concluded by late July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms that the summer peak (P19-P23) has concluded. Demand in the last three periods has settled down significantly (P24: 135, P25: 133, P26: 339). While P26 showed a moderate increase to 339, it remains below the peak levels of >400-500. Current on-hand inventory (1021) is very high following the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P20, P21, P22). With an additional 634 units in-transit (from P24), and a lead time of 4 periods, we are significantly overstocked relative to the post-peak demand level (~200 units/period). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (averaging P24-P26) to reflect the post-peak environment (~202 units/period before the (1+L) multiplier). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the volatility during this transition. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the high pipeline and on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand correction confirmed: Demand dropped from >400 units (P19-P23) to an average of ~202 units (P24-P26). On-hand and pipeline inventory are currently sufficient for approximately 8 periods of demand at this new rate.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has transitioned from a high-summer peak (>400 units/period) to a post-peak correction phase starting around Period 24. Recent demand (P24-P27) has been 135, 133, 339, and 243, averaging approximately 212 units/period. The current date (2019/8/19) suggests we are moving into the late summer/early autumn season where base demand for lingerie typically stabilizes. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (778) plus in-transit stock (634) totals 1412 units, which covers over 6 periods of recent average demand. Given the stock surplus, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the last 5 periods (N=5, including the end of the peak) to allow the OR backend to draw down the excess inventory while maintaining a safe service level. This will stop further ordering until pipeline levels align with the current sales rate.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The peak summer season (June/July) has concluded, and demand has settled into a lower post-peak regime. Over the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 190.0 units per period (135, 133, 339, 243, 100), though it remains somewhat volatile with a standard deviation of approximately 98. This matches the 'post-summer correction' noted in previous carry-over insights. Currently, the on-hand inventory is very high (1312 units), which covers approximately 7 periods of demand at the current average rate. With an additional 99 units in-transit, there is no immediate risk of stock-out. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering because on-hand + pipeline exceeds the calculated base stock. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the recent lower demand levels accurately. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 allows for a wider window to account for the residual volatility seen during the transition from peak to off-peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-692.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal summer peak for this product (Womens Lingerie) has clearly concluded. Since Period 24 (late July), demand has undergone a sustained downward correction, averaging approximately 179 units/period (P24: 135, P25: 133, P26: 339 [outlier], P27: 243, P28: 100, P29: 124). Excluding the Period 26 outlier, the average is ~147 units. The current on-hand inventory (1188 units) is extremely high, covering over 6 periods of demand even at the high-end estimate of 180 units/period. Total pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 99 units from Period 28. With lead time stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P24-P29) to capture the post-peak regime and allow the OR backend to minimize orders to reduce the inventory surplus and associated holding costs ($1.0/unit).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P24-P29) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~179 units/period, significantly down from the >400 units/period seen during the June/July summer peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong briefs) has exited its summer peak (June/July) and entered a stable post-peak regime. Analyzing the demand from Period 24 to Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 168 units/period (135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124, 101). The current on-hand inventory is 1087 units, which covers approximately 6.5 periods of demand at this current rate. With an additional 99 units in-transit (ordered in Period 28), the total pipeline of 1186 units is more than sufficient to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time window. Consequently, the OR backend capped policy will correctly output an order of 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect this steady post-summer demand level and avoid holding excessive stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P24-P30) confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~168 units/period with lower volatility compared to the summer peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-702.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak (P19-P23) into a lower-volume post-peak regime. Over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), demand has averaged approximately 156 units/period, with the most recent three periods (P29-P31) showing even lower levels (124, 101, 77). This SKU currently has 1010 units on-hand and 99 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~156 units, required stock is ~780 units. Our current inventory position (1010 + 99 = 1109 units) is well above this requirement, sufficient for approximately 7 periods of demand. To avoid escalating holding costs which are $1.0/unit while profit is $4.0/unit (critical z-score is approximately 0.84), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the post-peak stability. The OR backend will likely place a zero order because the pipeline exceeds the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P24-P31) stabilized further: average demand is 156 units/period, significantly lower than the ~168 units noted previously.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Briefs) has stabilized into a post-summer regime. Analyzing the data from Period 24 to Period 32 (following the seasonal peak), the mean demand is approximately 161 units per period (135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124, 101, 77, 194). Removing the outlier in Period 26 and the recent slight uptick, the baseline is closer to 150. Currently, on-hand inventory is 915 units with 0 in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate of ~161 units/period, required stock is ~805 units. Since on-hand (915) already exceeds this coverage, no new order is necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime (using recent_N where N=9) to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while maintaining a safe buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation remains somewhat high due to fluctuations). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P24-P32) mean settled at ~161 units/period, confirming a significant drop from the seasonal peak (>400 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2545.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observed a massive and unexpected demand spike of 692 units, which is a complete outlier compared to the post-summer average of ~161 units (over 4x the recent mean). This spike has drastically reduced on-hand inventory from 915 to 223 units. Given the date (Sept 30), this could be a late-September promotional event or a recurring specific demand event for this SKU (Womens Lingerie). Because this spike is so severe, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to protect against a potential multi-period high-demand regime or further volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to incorporate this spike into the moving average while still acknowledging the prior lower baseline. Pipeline inventory is extremely low (47 units from P33), so the OR engine needs to place a significant order to restore the base stock level against this new high-variance environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-summer demand regime (P24-P32) of ~161 units/period was interrupted by a massive demand spike of 692 units in Period 33 (Date: 2019/9/23).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie Thong) is experiencing a second major demand surge. Following a summer peak in June/July (P19-P23), demand dropped to a stable baseline of ~160 units (P24-P32). However, Period 33 and 34 show a massive spike (692 and 335 units respectively), with a stock-out occurring in Period 34. This likely represents an autumn/pre-holiday promotion or seasonal shopping event. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). The average of the last 2 periods is ~513 units. I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture this sharp upward trend and a higher sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed (692 vs 335). The in-transit inventory is 567 units (orders from P33 and P34), which is insufficient for the expected demand over the lead time (~500+ per period). Lead time remains 'calculate' as historical arrivals have been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge detected starting Period 33: demand jumped from ~160 to an average of 513 units/period (+220%), likely a secondary seasonal peak or promotion. Stock-out occurred in Period 34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant demand surge that started in Period 33 (Date: 2019/9/23). Recent demand figures are 692, 335, and 123 (the last limited by stock-out), representing a shift from a post-summer mean of ~160 to a surge mean of approximately 383 (weighted by the recent few periods and stock-out evidence). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a massive pipeline of 1496 units. However, given a lead time of 4 periods, these units (ordered in P33-P35) will only start arriving in Period 37. To bridge this gap and maintain the service level for the (L+1) period window during this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the surge. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the heightened volatility (123 to 692 range). Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4), as historical consistency (P1-P28) shows it stays stable despite demand fluctuation.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed starting Period 33 (Sept 2019): Average demand jumped from ~160 to ~383 units/period. The regime is characterized by high volatility (Std Dev ~285) and immediate stock-outs due to low on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) entered a significant high-demand regime starting Period 33 (late Sept), likely a seasonal peak or promotion. The mean demand for the last four periods (P33-P36) is 312.5 units/period with extremely high volatility (Period 33 demand was 692). The system is currently in a severe stock-out situation (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (2353 units) includes several large recent orders (P34: 520, P35: 929, P36: 857). Given the stable lead time of 4 periods, the P33 order (47 units) is expected to arrive in Period 37, the P34 order (520 units) in Period 38, and the P35 order (929 units) in Period 39. To address the immediate stock-out and capture this high-demand regime while managing the significant pipeline, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the surge and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility. L remains default (4 periods). This will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to justify the current pipeline and any necessary additional ordering until the surge stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge starting Period 33 confirmed: Mean demand P33-P36 is 312.5 units/period with a peak of 692, following a period of stability around 160. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently transitioning through a high-demand period that began around Period 33 (late September), though recent observed 'sold' units are low due to stock-outs (on-hand 0). Total demand across P33-P37 averages ~275 units/period (692, 335, 123, 100, 124). The drop in demand in P35-P37 likely reflects censored demand due to zero stock, although the 692 spike in P33 was an outlier. We are expecting significant arrivals starting next period: P34 order (520) in P38, P35 order (929) in P39, and P36 order (857) in P40. With 2306 units already in transit, we are well-covered for the current forecasted demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this high-volatility regime, while maintaining the proven lead time of 4. This will prevent over-ordering while we wait for the large pipeline to land.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme since Period 33: actual demand is likely higher than 'sold' units in P34-P37 due to stock-outs (on-hand 0). Mean demand P33-P37 (including likely censored periods) is ~275 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has entered a highly erratic phase. Following a massive spike in P33 (692 units) and stock-outs in P34-P37, recent demand in P37-P38 (124 and 115 units) suggests the 'surge' might have been a short-lived promotion or a very high-variance peak. However, censored demand in P34-P36 means we must be cautious. The 'In-transit' quantity is very high (1786 units) due to large orders placed during the stock-out (P35: 929, P36: 857). These orders are expected to arrive in P39 and P40. Current on-hand is 405. Given the extreme volatility (P33-P38 demands: 692, 335*, 123*, 100*, 124, 115), I will use a conservative recent_N (N=6) to capture this entire volatile regime while accounting for the high 'mu' required by the backend to justify the existing pipeline. L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P33; the immediate surge (P33: 692) has cooled to ~120 units in P37-P38, but the mean for the P33-P38 period remains high (~248 units) when accounting for suppressed sales.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volatility regime following a massive demand spike in late September (P33). While demand in the last few periods (P37-P39) has moderated to an average of ~160 units, the overall average since the P33 surge (P33-P39) is approximately 261 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (1093) and in-transit units (857) provide a high stock level of 1950 units. Given the post-spike stabilization observed in previous cycles (like the summer peak), I expect demand to settle around 200 units. A lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed. With 1950 total units against a projected 5-period demand (review + lead time) of ~1000-1300 units, the system is currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average since the P33 spike to ensure the OR engine maintains a safe but not excessive buffer while the volatility subsides.

Carry-over insight: Post-September surge regime (P33-P39) mean demand is ~261 units/period with high volatility. Recent 3-period demand (P37-P39) suggests a cooling trend toward ~160 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-inventory state (on-hand: 1563) following the arrival of large orders placed during the September demand spike (Period 33-36). Historical demand analysis shows a primary summer peak (June/July) and a significant secondary spike in late September (Period 33: 692), followed by a volatile cooling period. The immediate prior periods (P38-P40) show a rising demand trend (115, 241, 387), which may indicate the start of a late-year/holiday surge given the date (Nov 18). However, current on-hand inventory is exceptionally high, covering approximately 4-6 periods of demand even at the elevated levels. Under the capped base-stock policy, providing high mu_hat and sigma_hat would not trigger new orders due to the massive pipeline/on-hand surplus. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-September-spike behavior (P33-P40) including the high-demand periods and the current rise. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand trend observed post-September spike: Mean demand P33-P40 is ~264.6 units/period with high volatility. Recent demand (P38-P40) shows a potential holiday-season ramp-up (115 to 387).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are entering the peak holiday shopping season (Black Friday and December). Demand has shown a clear upward trend over the last four periods: 241 (P39), 387 (P40), and 348 (P41). The mean of these recent periods is ~325 units, significantly higher than the early-November average. Given the product category (Womens Lingerie/Thong), we expect this higher demand to persist or increase further through December. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 1215 units, with 145 units in transit. Using the recent 4-period window captures this holiday ramp-up more effectively than the long-term mean. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 samples and use a calculated lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand increased from ~120 in P37-38 to an average of ~325 units/period in P39-P41 (+170%), signaling the start of the Q4 peak season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the early December holiday season (Period 43, 2019/12/02). History shows a clear holiday demand ramp-up starting around Period 39, with demand over the last four periods (P39-P42) averaging 321.75 units (241, 387, 348, 311). This is a significant increase from the post-September lull. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent concluded shipments (P33-P36). Given the proximity to the December holiday peak, I am applying a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime while maintaining a buffer for seasonal volatility. On-hand inventory is healthy (904), but with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a robust pipeline to cover the rest of the December/January cycle. A target base stock based on the ~322 mean across the (L+1=5) period risk window is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P39-P42 is 321.75 units/period, representing a sustained +100% increase over the October lull (~160 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the holiday demand regime (Q4). Over the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 310.6 units/period (241, 387, 348, 311, 266), which is significantly higher than the October lull. Although Demand decreased slightly in the most recent periods, we must maintain a service level consistent with a holiday peak. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 638 units, and we have 803 units in-transit (P41 order of 145, P42 order of 234, P43 order of 424). Total pipeline inventory is 1441 units. Since lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods. With a mean of ~311 across the last 5 periods, the required base stock is approximately 1555 units. Given we have 1441 units already in the system, a modest order is warranted to maintain a buffer for potential volatility. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this sustained Q4 regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). We are in the final stages of the holiday shopping season. Demand for 'Womens Lingerie' (thongs) has stabilized at a high level. Since Period 39 (start of November), demand has averaged approximately 322 units per period (P39-P44 observations: 241, 387, 348, 311, 266, 380). Although there is high in-transit inventory (1027 units from orders in P41-P44), the on-hand inventory has dropped to 258 units, which is below one period's average holiday demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P33-P36 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). I will set L to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I will use the average of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current holiday regime (mean ~322). For sigma_hat, I will use N=6 to reflect the current volatility in this holiday period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P39-P44) confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 322 units/period (std dev ~56), representing a sustained high-demand period for the December holiday season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand for the holiday regime (since Period 39) has stabilized at a high level with a mean of ~337 units/period (average of P39-P45: 241, 387, 348, 311, 266, 380, 360). Recent data shows strong late-season demand, with P44 and P45 both seeing \u2265360 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P41 arrived in P45). With on-hand inventory low at 43 units and a high demand expectation for the remaining holiday period and transition into the new year, we need to maintain high service levels. I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the holiday regime from P39 to P45) to capture this higher seasonal average of ~337 units/period. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect current volatility and ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the seasonal demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1108.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand holiday season regime (Dec 2019), with demand averaging approximately 342 units/period over the last 8 periods (P39-P46). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stock-out in P46 where demand (358) exceeded starting inventory (277). In-transit inventory (1468 units) consists of orders from P43 (424), P44 (224), P45 (422), and P46 (398). The P43 order is expected to arrive in P47 arrival resolution. To maintain a high service level during this peak, mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current regime mean (~342), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) window of ~1710 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P39-P46) is sustained at a mean of ~342 units/period with moderate volatility (Std Dev ~50). This represents a stable high-demand regime for late Q4.
