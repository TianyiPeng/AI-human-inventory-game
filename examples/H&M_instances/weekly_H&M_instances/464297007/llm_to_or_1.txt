Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong Underwear). Historical demand data provided: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122]. The last two periods show a significant decline (189, 122) compared to the initial three (267-307), suggesting a potential demand regime shift or post-promotion stabilization. Given that it is February 11th, we are past the early-year retail peak. Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and a promised lead time of 2, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover at least (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the recent dip, as using only the last 2 periods might be too aggressive if the drop was an outlier. The backend will compute mu_hat as (1+2) * mean(267, 298, 307, 189, 122) = 3 * 236.6 = 709.8. This ensures we order enough to fill the empty pipeline while adjusting for the recent lower demand trend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie). Current historical demands are [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] plus the newly observed Period 1 demand of 159. The demand shows a downward trend from initial peaks of ~300 to current levels ~120-190. Period 1 ended with 0 inventory and 159 units of lost sales because the first order of 367 units (placed in P1) has a promised lead time of 2 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 3. For the mu_hat calculation, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (last 3 points: 122, 189, 159; average ~157). L is set to 'default' (2). The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (Period 3) based on the promised lead time of 2. Historical demand has shown volatility, with a significant spike to 373 units in Period 2. The mean of the 7 available demand points is approximately 245 units. The product (Womens Lingerie - Thong) may experience seasonal shifts, but without a confirmed longer-term trend beyond the recent spike, I will use a window of the last 4 samples (including the spike) to calculate demand to ensure we aren't under-ordering if the high demand persists. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 2, as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest otherwise. The target pipeline (mu_hat) for 3 periods (L+1) based on a recent mean of ~240 would be around 720 units. With 519 currently in transit, the OR engine will trigger a supplemental order to bridge the gap and rebuild a buffer after the initial stockouts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Lingerie (thong briefs). Historical demand shows a downward trend: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] (pre-game) and [159, 373, 301] (in-game). The most recent in-game demand was 301. Inventory status: 218 on-hand, 276 in-transit (ordered P3). Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in 2 periods (as promised), but P2 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests a potentially shorter or volatile lead time. However, promised L=2 is a safe anchor. Demand recently has been averaging around 275 over the last 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the post-start behavior, and 'default' for lead time since we have one instance of the promised lead time being met and one instance of it being early.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's cotton thong (lingerie). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game) is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the 4 periods of gameplay are [159, 373, 301, 278]. Average demand across all 9 data points is approximately 255. Significant stockouts occurred in Periods 1, 2, and 4 due to zero on-hand inventory. The lead time analysis shows Period 1 order arrived in 2 periods and Period 2 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting a volatile lead time (promised is 2). Currently, 0 units are on-hand and 733 are in-transit (orders from Period 3 and 4). To recover from the stockout and handle potential demand spikes as we move further into March, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand levels and account for the fact that early low 'sold' units were due to stockouts, not low demand. L is set to default as the average lead time (1.5) is close to the promised 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's cotton thong underwear, which typically exhibits stable, low-seasonality demand. Current history shows demand ranging from 159 to 373 (mean ~260). We are at Period 6. Observed lead times have been 2 periods (P1 order arrived P3) and 1 period (P2 order arrived P3), with the P3 order arriving in P5 (2 periods). The P4 order (457 units) is expected to arrive this period (P6) based on the promised lead time of 2. Currently, on-hand is low (26) and we just experienced a stockout in P4. Total pipeline is 616 (P4: 457 + P5: 159). I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the current mean (approx 260) and use default for L as 2 periods appears reliable enough. sigma_hat will use the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $597.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context shows a stabilization period after a peak in P2/P3. The recent 4-period demand trend is slightly downward (301, 278, 250, 216), but remains within the 200-300 range. Current date (late March) does not align with major shopping holidays in the immediate term, though spring seasonality often drives moderate interest in basic lingerie. Lead times have been stable at the promised 2 periods (with one exception of 1 period in P2), so I will use the default promised lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-peak stabilization while ignoring the earlier low-demand historical outliers (122, 189). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected arrival of the P5 order while accounting for the current demand regime of ~260-280 units per period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a stable lingerie item. Historical demand over the last 7 periods is [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253]. Excluding the Period 2 outlier (373), demand is relatively stable around 250-260 units. Current inventory is critically low (14 units on-hand), and we have 671 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, and P7). Reviewing the lead time history: P1 order arrived P3 (L=2), P2 order arrived P3 (L=1), P3 order arrived P5 (L=2), P4 order arrived P6 (L=2). The P5 order (159 units) was expected in P7 (L=2) but has not arrived yet, suggesting a slight delay or variability. I will stick to L=2 for planning. Given the recent demand stability after the initial ramp-up/volatility, I will use a recent N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~250. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the current lower volatility compared to the early game.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), the SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Underwear) is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). Recent demand has been stable but strong, with the last 5 samples averaging 256 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have varied: Period 1 arrived in 2 periods, Period 2 in 1 period, Period 3 in 2 periods, Period 4 in 2 periods, and Period 5 took 3 periods. The average of observed lead times is (2+1+2+2+3)/5 = 2.0. However, the Period 6 order (289 units) and Period 7 order (223 units) are currently in-transit and overdue based on a standard 2-period lead time. We expect these arrivals soon. To ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand, I will use 'calculate' for L (which results in 2.0) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stable demand regime (avg ~256). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This setup should signal the backend to order enough to recover from the current stock-out once in-transit units arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: range 1-3 periods, average 2.0. Period 5 order experienced a delay (L=3).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's lingerie thong. Historical demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 254 units and a standard deviation of 63. Recent demand (last 3 periods) shows a slight downward trend (283, 176), though the earliest data point in that set was high (253). Lead times have shown variability: while the promised lead time is 2, we've observed values of 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, Period 5 and Period 6 orders both took 3 periods to arrive, suggesting a potential shift or instability in the supply chain. Currently, on-hand inventory is 336 units with 295 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 8 and 9). To ensure we cover demand across the risk horizon (Lead time + 1 review period), I will set L to 3 to account for the recent delays. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime, which averages approximately 236 units per period. This results in a total mu_hat of (1+3)*236 = 944. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie/Thong) shows a recent downward trend in demand, likely settling after an early peak. The last 5 periods show a mean demand of approximately 219 units, compared to the overall historical mean of ~239. Current inventory status: On-hand = 167, In-transit = 598. The in-transit inventory includes orders from Period 8 (141), Period 9 (154), and Period 10 (303). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.0 based on recent history. Given the current date (April 22), we are post-Easter, which explains the cooling demand (176 and 169 in the last two weeks). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (avg ~219/period) rather than the volatile early periods. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from ~270 to ~172 (-36%) following a seasonal peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Underwear) has undergone a regime shift. Starting from Period 9, the average demand dropped from approximately 264 units/period to 174 units/period (a 34% decrease), likely following a seasonal peak in March. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower-demand environment (P9-P11). Regarding lead time, the promised L=2 is frequently missed, with recent actual lead times being [3, 3, 2, 3]. The average of recent lead times is 2.6, so I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average, which better captures the risk of 3-period arrivals. The current pipeline (457 units) combined with on-hand (132 units) is sufficient to cover the next (L+1) periods given the lower demand rate, preventing over-ordering while maintaining a service level for the 0.8 critical ratio.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie thongs) is currently in a demand regime shift. After a period of lower demand (~172 units), Period 12 saw a significant spike to 323 units, possibly due to early May seasonality or stock-outs in previous periods leading to pent-up demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0. There are 457 units in-transit: these consist of orders from Period 9 (154 units) and Period 10 (303 units). Based on recent lead time history (P8 arrived in 3 periods, P6 in 3 periods), these are expected to arrive in Period 13 or 14. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the observed delays (recent_N=5 captures the shift from L=2 to L=3). Mu_hat uses recent_N=5 (Periods 8-12: [283, 176, 169, 176, 323]) to capture the current mean of ~225. This yields a mu_hat of (1+3)*225 = 900. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility (Std Dev ~68), resulting in sqrt(4)*68 = 136. These parameters aim to rebuild safety stock after the stock-out in Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 12: demand spiked to 323 from an average of 172 (+87%), potentially signaling a new higher-demand regime or seasonal shift.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 (2019/5/13). The product is a women's cotton thong (lingerie). Historical demand analysis shows high demand in the first 8 periods (avg ~260), followed by a lower regime in Periods 9-11 (avg ~174), and a significant spike in Period 12 (323), followed by 122 in Period 13. This volatility (122 to 323) suggests we are in a high-variance period, potentially seasonal as we move into May. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced a stockout in Period 13. There are 782 units in-transit, including orders from P9 (154), P10 (303), and P13 (325). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.38 for the 8 concluded orders). Given the recent stockout and the high demand spike in Period 12, I will set L to 3 to account for observed delays and protect the pipeline. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high volatility while acknowledging the lower average of the last few weeks (~193 per period). This will result in a mu_hat of ~772 (1+3 * 193).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (Range: 122-323) in the most recent 3 periods. Actual lead time mean has shifted to ~2.4 periods based on history, with multiple occurrences of L=3.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent history shows a stockout since Period 12, leading to lost sales. Historical demand data shows a spike at Period 12 (323) followed by a drop (122, 151). The average of the last 6 samples (Periods 9-14) is 186.1, which reflects the post-peak regime. Lead times have been unstable, with several orders taking 3 periods to arrive (P5, P6, P8 orders). The orders from P9 (154 units), P10 (303 units), P13 (325 units), and P14 (119 units) are all in transit. The P9 and P10 orders are now technically overdue if L=2 (P9 was ordered 6 periods ago, P10 was ordered 5 periods ago). This strongly suggests either significantly delayed shipments or lost orders. I will adjust the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect the observed delays and use a recent_N approach for demand (N=6) to capture the current regime. Setting L=3 helps the OR backend increase the pipeline inventory requirement to cover the longer fulfillment window and account for the uncertainty in arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss or severe delay: Orders from Period 9 and 10 have not arrived as of Period 15 (5-6 periods elapsed), despite a promised lead time of 2 and an observed max lead time of 3.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong Underwear) is facing a critical stockout and supply chain disruption. There is 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 901 units reflects several overdue orders: Period 9 (154 units, now 7 periods old) and Period 10 (303 units, now 6 periods old) have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, suggesting they are likely lost. Subsequent orders from Period 13 (325 units) and Period 14 (119 units) are still within a plausible lead-time window (L=2 or 3). Demand has stabilized after a volatility spike, with recent demands of 122, 151, and 171 (avg ~148). Because the backend OR engine assumes promised lead time (L=2) and counts all 'In-transit' items (including the 457 likely lost units from P9-P10) against the base stock, it will likely not order enough. To compensate for the pipeline inflation caused by lost orders, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 (to reflect the reality of current delays) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + L) * average_recent_demand = (1 + 3) * 148 = 592. However, to force the backend to place an order despite the 901 'in-transit' units, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed that pipeline. Given the current pipeline of 901, and the need to cover future demand, I set mu_hat to 1200. This is a strategic 'explicit' override to trigger replenishment despite the presence of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 9 (154 units) and Period 10 (303 units) are confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed as of Period 16 (L > 6). This is causing pipeline inflation that prevents the OR backend from ordering. Explicit parameter overrides are now required to force replenishment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is in a critical stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary obstacle is 'pipeline inflation': there are 1330 units in-transit, but 457 of these (ordered in P9 and P10) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Because the OR backend counts all in-transit units against the target base stock, it will stop ordering unless parameters are adjusted. Recent demand (P13-P16) has averaged 161 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (the observed maximum), a safe base stock to cover (L+1) periods would be 161 * 4 = 644 units, plus a safety buffer. However, the backend sees 1330 units in-transit, so it will calculate 'order = 644 - 1330', resulting in zero orders. To force a replenishment order of approximately 300-400 units, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to override the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1800 (calculated as ~1330 phantom/real transit + 450 desired stock) to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the lost shipments. L is set to 3 to reflect the actual historical delay pattern.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 457 units from P9-P10 are confirmed lost. Mu_hat must remain explicitly inflated to offset these units until they are removed or the system stabilizes.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand = 0) despite a massive in-transit pipeline of 1909 units. Historical analysis confirms that 457 units (ordered in P9 and P10) are lost. Furthermore, orders from P13 (325 units) and P14 (119 units) are significantly overdue (5 and 4 periods elapsed vs. promised L=2). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy: final_order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap). With pipeline_inventory at 1909, the backend will refuse to order unless the pipeline is offset. Demand since Period 13 has averaged 159.6 units/period (N=5). To force the backend to place a replenishment order and bypass the phantom pipeline units (specifically the confirmed lost 457 units and the likely lost/stalled 444 units from P13-14), I am explicitly inflating mu_hat. I estimate necessary coverage for (L+1)=4 periods at 160 units/period (~640) plus an offset of ~1000 units to clear the pipeline subtraction, resulting in mu_hat = 1650. This ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Crisis (P18): 457 units (P9-10) confirmed lost; 444 units (P13-14) likely lost/stalled (L>4). Total 'ghost' pipeline = 901 units. Mu_hat must be explicitly set >1600 to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $826.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Historical demand shows a mean of approx. 210 units/period (last 10 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 298. The 'In-transit' pipeline is severely inflated at 1330 units. Analysis of history confirms that 901 of these units are likely lost or indefinitely delayed: P9 (154), P10 (303), P13 (325), and P14 (119) have all exceeded a lead time of 4+ periods (promised L=2). However, P17 (ordered 579) arrived in P18 (L=1), and P16 (429) is still within a reasonable window. To bypass the OR engine's 'ghost' pipeline, I must set mu_hat (target stock level) high enough to trigger an order despite the 1330 units reported in transit. Based on a 2-period lead time and 210 units/period demand, a healthy base stock is ~630. With 1330 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1960 (630 + 1330) to signal that more inventory is needed. I keep L at 2 to reflect the promised speed, though actual performance is volatile.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline ghost inventory updated: 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) confirmed lost/stalled as of P19. P17 arrived in L=1, but P16 remains outstanding at L=3.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. The OR backend sees an 'In-transit' quantity of 1324 units. However, based on lead-time analysis, the following orders are almost certainly lost or significantly delayed: P9 (154), P10 (303), P13 (325), and P14 (119). These sum to 901 units. If the backend considers these 901 units as 'pipeline inventory', it will fail to place new orders, leading to future stockouts. Recent demand has surged (Period 19 demand was 556), and we are entering late June, where summer lingerie demand remains relevant. The current on-hand inventory is 171 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1324 units in-transit, I must set 'mu_hat' (which acts as the target base stock level) to a value higher than the visible pipeline + on-hand + safety stock. I estimate a base stock requirement of ~1900 units to offset the 901 ghost units and cover current demand (avg ~300 * 3 periods + safety). I set L=2 as the promised baseline and mu_hat explicitly to 1950 to trigger a meaningful order. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect high recent volatility (122 to 556).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost pipeline confirmed at 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14). Demand surge observed in P19 (556 units) suggests a shift to a high-demand regime or seasonal peak.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are navigating a severe supply chain crisis. A total of 901 units (from orders in Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14) are confirmed as lost or indefinitely stalled, as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods by 5-11 periods. This creates 'ghost inventory' in the in-transit pipeline (1,990 units total), which prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed this ghost count. Additionally, demand has surged significantly (556 units in P19, 261 units in P20), potentially marking a summer seasonal peak. To force the necessary replenishment and cover for the lost stock plus high demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,800. This value accounts for the 901 ghost units plus a forecast of approximately 600 units/period over the (L+1)=3 period window (1,800 + 901 \u2248 2,701). Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed ghost pipeline remains at 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14). Summer demand peak observed with average demand over the last 3 periods rising to ~360 units (+50% vs previous regime).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: July 8, 2019. We are in a post-peak summer demand regime for lingerie. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 339 units, though it is cooling from a high of 556. The 'In-transit' figure of 1922 includes 901 units of confirmed ghost inventory (Orders from P9, P10, P13, and P14) that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places a correct order, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 901 ghost units. With a target demand of ~300/period and L=2, base stock needs to be ~900 (real) + 901 (offset) = 1801. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1850 to ensure adequate safety stock and counteract pipeline inflation. L is set to default (2) as recent actual lead times have stabilized between 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14). Demand has stabilized into a summer regime averaging ~300 units/period (P19-P21), requiring sustained mu_hat inflation until ghost units are cleared.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), we have a high on-hand inventory of 1568 units. Recent demand (P19-P22) has shown a summer regime averaging 340 units/period (556, 261, 201, 341). However, the system still reports 901 units 'In-transit' from Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14, which are now 9-14 periods old and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' pipeline from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set extremely high. Currently, on-hand (1568) is sufficient for ~4.5 periods of demand (1568 / 340 \u2248 4.6), which exceeds the (L+1=3) coverage window. To prevent the backend from triggering unnecessary orders while we burn through this excess, but also to ensure the 'ghost' units don't block future orders once stock levels normalize, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the summer demand mean (~340/period). I will keep sigma_hat at default to reflect current volatility. No new order is expected or needed this period given the high on-hand balance.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (July 22), the SKU is in a high-demand summer regime. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has averaged 356 units (556, 261, 201, 341, 422), significantly higher than the spring average (~170). On-hand inventory is currently high (1146 units) following recent successful arrivals from P19, P20, and P21. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 901 units remains a concern; these units (ordered in P9, P10, P13, and P14) are confirmed as lost/ghost inventory as they are now 10-15 periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' pipeline from the target base stock, I must continue to set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds both the expected demand (3 periods * 356 = 1068) and the ghost pipeline (901) to ensure the system doesn't under-order if demand spikes further. However, given the current high on-hand stock (1146), no order is likely needed this period. I will set mu_hat to 1300 to reflect the 3-period demand forecast while partially accounting for the ghost inventory, and use 'recent_N' for sigma to capture the high volatility (range 201-556) seen in the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P19-P23): average demand increased to 356 units/period. Ghost inventory (901 units) persists and must be countered by explicit mu_hat settings until cleared.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/7/29), we have 1,011 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory of 901 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P9, P10, P13, and P14) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the effective inventory position is exactly the on-hand amount: 1,011 units. The summer demand regime remains active, though Period 24 saw a dip to 135 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 320 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). A base stock target of ~960-1050 units is appropriate. Since the current on-hand (1011) satisfies this requirement, no new order is strictly necessary this period. However, to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 901 ghost units as available supply and potentially blocking future orders if demand spikes, I will continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1,200 to ensure the backend target remains slightly above the ghost pipeline + on-hand if needed, though with current stock levels, the 'cap' logic or current position will likely result in a zero or near-zero order, which is correct for a 'wait and see' approach following the P24 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-346.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis shows a significant cooling from the summer peak (P19-P23 avg: 356) to a much lower level in the last two periods (P24: 135, P25: 133). On-hand inventory is high (878 units), providing approximately 6.5 periods of coverage at current demand levels. The ghost pipeline of 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains in the system. Because on-hand inventory is now sufficient to cover near-term demand despite the ghost inventory offsetting the pipeline calculation, I will transition from 'explicit' mu_hat inflation back to 'recent_N' to allow the backend to naturally stop ordering. Setting N=7 for mu_hat captures the recent slowdown (P24-25) while acknowledging the high-demand periods (P19-P23) to ensure the base stock calculation doesn't drop too aggressively while we observe if the lower demand persists. This will result in zero orders, allowing on-hand inventory to decrease and reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand slowdown observed: P24-P25 average demand fell to 134 units, signaling the end of the summer peak (previously ~350). Ghost inventory (901 units) remains confirmed lost/stalled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 27 (mid-August). Demand analysis shows a significant slowdown following the summer peak (P19-P23 avg: 356). The last three periods (P24-P26) show a lower average of 202 units (135, 133, 339), though P26 saw a rebound. The 'ghost' inventory of 901 units (from P9, P10, P13, P14) remains in the 'In-transit' bucket despite being long lost, which artificially suppresses the backend's ordering logic. Current on-hand inventory is 539 units. Given the lower recent demand and high on-hand stock, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the post-summer slowdown (approx 202/unit per period). Because ghost inventory (901) + on-hand (539) = 1440, and base stock will likely be calculated around 600-800, the OR backend will correctly place zero orders. No explicit inflation is needed this period as we are overstocked relative to the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: Summer peak ended; average demand decreased from 356 to ~200 units (-44%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward from the summer peak (avg ~350) to a more moderate level. In the last four periods (P24-P27), demand was 135, 133, 339, and 243, averaging 212.5 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 296 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 901 units represents orders from P9, P10, P13, and P14, which are now more than 13 periods overdue and are confirmed lost/stalled as documented in previous carry-over insights. These 'ghost' units prevent the backend OR logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this and ensure we maintain stock for the upcoming weeks, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high enough to offset the 901 ghost units. Since we want to cover approximately (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the new average of ~215 (total ~645), and we have 296 on-hand, we need a target base stock of ~645. To force an order when the backend sees (296 + 901) = 1197 units in the system, mu_hat must be set above 1200. I am setting mu_hat to 1600 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust replenishment signal and maintain a high service level as the on-hand inventory depletes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), the SKU is entering a post-summer demand regime. The most recent demand samples (P24-P28: 135, 133, 339, 243, 100) average 190 units/period, confirming a shift away from the earlier summer peak of ~350 units. The 'ghost' inventory of 901 units (from P9, P10, P13, P14) is still officially counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline (1431 units), despite being lost months ago. This ghost pipeline significantly exceeds the required base stock, which would normally block the OR backend from ordering. To ensure continuous availability, mu_hat must be set explicitly high to 'see through' the 901 units of lost stock. My target base stock is approximately 1,800 units (covering L+1 periods of current demand plus a safety buffer). Given that the backend subtracts the full pipeline (1431) and current on-hand (196) from the base stock (Total Inventory = 1627), an explicit mu_hat of 1800-2000 is required to trigger replenishment. I will use mu_hat = 1950 to ensure a healthy order is placed despite the pipeline inflation. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging around 2.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update: 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remain confirmed lost as of P29. Current demand regime (P24-P28) average is ~190 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the SKU is in a post-summer demand regime. Analysis of demand since Period 24 shows an average of approximately 179 units per period (135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124). The high demand spike in Period 26 (339) and Period 27 (243) prevents a simple low-demand forecast, so I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. 

Regarding inventory, the system shows 1899 units 'In-transit'. However, 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 901 units (from orders in P9, P10, P13, and P14) are lost/stalled and will not arrive. Thus, the functional pipeline is 1899 - 901 = 998 units. These functional units come from orders in P28 (530) and P29 (468). With on-hand inventory at 72 and expected demand around 180-200, the current stock + functional pipeline (approx 1070 units) covers roughly 5-6 periods of demand, which is well above the required (L+1)=3 periods. 

To prevent the OR backend from over-ordering due to the 901 'ghost' units in its pipeline calculation, I must continue to explicitly set mu_hat. To maintain a safety buffer without triggering new orders while we consume existing stock, I set mu_hat = 1200 (covering the ghost units + minimal operating stock). I will use 'calculate' for L as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the recent high volatility (SD \u2248 95).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the product (cotton thong briefs) is exiting its summer peak. The current demand regime (P24-P30) shows a significant slowdown, with an average demand of approximately 168 units per period, compared to the summer peak of ~350 units. On-hand inventory is 501 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (1369 units) is heavily inflated by 901 units confirmed as lost from Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14. These 'ghost units' prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to bypass the ghost inventory while accounting for the current demand forecast and the promised lead time (L=2). To ensure the backend sees a need for stock, the base_stock calculation (mu_hat) must exceed the total 'pipeline' (ghost 901 + real in-transit 468 = 1369). Setting mu_hat to 1900 provides a safety buffer and ensures replenishment continues despite the persistent data error regarding lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update: 901 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remain confirmed lost as of P31. Post-summer demand (P24-P30) has stabilized at an average of 168 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has significantly cooled following the summer peak (P19-P23), with the last four periods averaging 100.5 units (P28-P31), and P31 hitting a low of 77. This marks a confirmed post-summer regime shift. Ghost pipeline inventory (901 units from P9, P10, P13, P14) remains confirmed as lost or stalled, as these orders are now 18-23 periods overdue. The current in-transit total of 1530 includes these 901 ghost units plus recent orders from P29 (468) and P31 (161). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 901 lost units and responds to the current demand level of ~100-110 units/period, mu_hat must be set explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand. With L=2, (2+1)*110 = 330. To bypass the ghost inventory of 901, mu_hat is set to 1231 (330 + 901). This allows the system to recognize that it needs ~330 units of 'real' stock. Since current on-hand is 424 and real in-transit is 629 (468+161), no order will be placed this period, which is appropriate given the current overstock situation (424 on-hand vs ~100 demand).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P28-P31) average demand decreased to 100 units/period (-40% vs previous post-summer estimate of 168).

Daily Reward (R_t): $546.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (~350 units) to a post-summer regime averaging ~119 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). On-hand inventory is 230. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1530 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory: 901 units from P9, P10, P13, and P14 are confirmed lost/stalled, and the 468 units from P29 are now officially overdue (L=4+). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this ghost pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome (Ghost Pipeline + Valid In-transit - On-hand). Specifically, valid in-transit is likely only the 161 units from P31. The ghost/stalled total is 901 (old) + 468 (P29) = 1369 units. Setting mu_hat to 1800 effectively signals to the backend that the 'true' needed stock level exceeds the phantom 1.5k units, maintaining a buffer against current demand of ~120/period and covering for the 2-period lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent volatility (Range 77-194).

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update: P29 order (468 units) is now confirmed stalled/overdue (L=4) alongside the previously identified 901 units, bringing the total ghost inventory to 1369 units. Post-summer demand (P28-P32) average is 119 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 34 (Sep 30, 2019). A massive demand spike of 692 units occurred in Period 33, far exceeding the previous post-summer average of ~119. This likely reflects a seasonal or promotional event for the 'Womens Lingerie' category. Current inventory is 0. Pipeline Issues: There are 1,369 units confirmed lost/stalled (P9, P10, P13, P14 = 901 units; P29 = 468 units). The backend sees In-transit = 1638, but only 269 units (P31, P33) are realistically expected to arrive. Ghost inventory (1369 units) is preventing the OR engine from ordering. Strategy: We must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the ghost inventory. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the new potential spike level (~350-400 units/period) plus the ghost inventory, we need a mu_hat significantly higher than the current pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 2600 (Ghost 1369 + Target Stock ~1200) to force a substantial replenishment order and restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at P33: Demand rose to 692 units, signaling a potential new high-demand regime or promotional peak. Ghost pipeline update: Total confirmed lost/stalled units increased to 1369 (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) as of P34.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the SKU is facing a critical stockout following a massive demand surge in P33 (692 units) and sustained high demand in P34 (335 units). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline is heavily inflated at 2768 units, but a significant portion (1369 units from P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) is confirmed lost or stalled. Additionally, the large order placed in P34 (1291 units) is within its promised lead time but hasn't arrived. To trigger a necessary replenishment order and bypass the OR backend's pipeline-based capping, mu_hat must be set explicitly higher than the current perceived pipeline. Given the recent demand spike and the need to offset the 1369 'ghost' units, I am setting mu_hat to 2000. This value accounts for a projected (1+L) demand (approx 3 * 200 = 600) plus a buffer to neutralize the stalled units in the OR backend's logic. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead time variance (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in P33-P34 (Avg 513) confirms a new high-demand regime or promotional event. Total ghost pipeline units remain at 1369 (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) as of P35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-676.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (mid-October), we are navigating a significant demand spike that occurred in Periods 33-34 (average ~513 units), which has since cooled to 123 units in Period 35. This volatility is typical for promotional events or early seasonal shifts. The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost pipeline' of 1369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, and P29) which are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled. These units erroneously inflate the OR backend's inventory view, preventing necessary replenishment orders. To counter this, mu_hat must be set explicitly high enough to trigger an order despite the 1477 units currently 'in-transit'. Our on-hand inventory is 1168 units. With recent demand averaging ~380 over the last 3 periods, we have roughly 3 periods of stock. Given the 2-period promised lead time, we are at a critical reorder point. I am setting mu_hat to 1900 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for replenishment, effectively offsetting the 1369 lost units and targeting a safety stock level that accounts for recent high-demand volatility. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 350 to buffer against the high standard deviation observed in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme (Range 77-692 in last 5 periods). Total ghost pipeline remains 1369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) confirmed lost/stalled as of P36. Order from P34 (1291 units) arrived successfully in 1 period, suggesting recent logistics for new orders may be stabilizing despite historical losses.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 1176 units following a large arrival in Period 35. Demand has cooled significantly from the late September peak (692, 335), with the last two periods showing 123 and 100 units respectively. The 'ghost pipeline' of 1369 units (from P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) remains unresolved and continues to mislead the OR backend's order calculation by inflating perceived stock. To prevent the backend from stopping orders prematurely when new stock is actually needed, I must maintain an explicit mu_hat that offsets these 1369 units. However, given the current high on-hand balance and the recent demand slowdown (averaging ~111 units over P35-P36), the immediate priority is to let the current inventory bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat to 1700 (1369 ghost units + ~330 for 3 periods of demand) which effectively signals a near-zero net requirement to the backend for this period, allowing on-hand stock to satisfy current demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has stabilized following the extreme spike in late September (P33-P34), with the last three periods (P35-P37) averaging 115.7 units. This indicates the spike was likely a short-term promotion rather than a sustained regime shift. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 1052) following the arrival of large orders from P33 and P34. However, the 'ghost' pipeline of 1369 units (from P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) remains a critical issue for the OR backend. These units will likely never arrive, but the backend sees them as incoming inventory, which would prevent it from ordering when needed. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the ghost pipeline plus the required safety stock. Given current demand (~116/period) and L=2, a base stock for 3 periods (L+1) would normally be around 350-400 units. To 'force' the backend to see a need, mu_hat is set to 1800 (Ghost 1369 + 3 periods of demand + safety margin). Since current on-hand (1052) is sufficient for ~9 periods of demand, the backend will likely order 0 this period anyway, which is optimal to avoid further holding costs while we wait for on-hand to deplete.

Carry-over insight: Post-promotion demand stabilization: P35-P37 average demand is 116 units/period, returning to pre-spike levels. Ghost pipeline remains at 1369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (2019/11/04), the demand has stabilized following a mid-September spike (P33-P34). The average demand for the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is 115.5 units, which is a significant drop from the promotional peak. Currently, we have 937 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory of 1,369 units is composed of confirmed 'ghost' units from P9, P10, P13, P14, and P29 which are lost or indefinitely stalled. These ghost units inflate the backend's pipeline view, effectively preventing it from ordering. However, given our high on-hand stock (937 units) and current low demand (~116 units/period), our current inventory covers approximately 8 periods of demand. This is well above the (L+1) target even with lead time variability. Therefore, no new orders are needed this period. We will use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-promotion regime and 'default' for L.

Carry-over insight: Post-promotion demand stabilization: P35-P38 average demand is 115.5 units/period. Current on-hand inventory (937) is sufficient for ~8 periods at this rate.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. Demand in Period 39 increased to 241 units, potentially signaling the start of the holiday shopping season (pre-Black Friday). The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units (Periods 9, 10, 13, 14, 29) which are confirmed lost/stalled but still counted by the OR backend. With 696 units on hand and a demand of ~240, we have approximately 3 periods of stock. However, given the promised lead time of 2 periods and the expected seasonal peak in late November/December, we must begin replenishment now to avoid stockouts. To trigger an order despite the 1,369 ghost units, mu_hat must be set higher than the sum of ghost inventory and desired safety stock. I am setting mu_hat to 2200 (explicit) to force the backend to place a replenishment order of approximately 150-300 units, accounting for both the ghost inventory and anticipated holiday demand. sigma_hat is set to 250 (explicit) to handle the high volatility observed during previous peak regimes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uptick: Period 39 demand (241) is 108% higher than the P35-P38 average (115.5), likely signaling the start of seasonal peak demand. Ghost pipeline remains at 1,369 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the holiday seasonal peak (mid-November), with demand rising from 115 (P38) to 241 (P39) and now 387 (P40). This confirms a sustained upward trend. On-hand inventory is 309 units. Total pipeline is 1715, but 1369 units are confirmed lost/stalled (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29), leaving an effective pipeline of only 346 units (ordered P40). The total 'effective' stock is 309 (on-hand) + 346 (in-transit) = 655 units. Given the rising demand, 655 units is insufficient to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review period=1), especially if demand continues to scale toward 400-500 units/period. To force the OR backend to order despite the 1369 'ghost' units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to exceed (Effective Inventory + Ghost Inventory). Current demand is ~390; for L=2, base stock needs to be ~390 * 3 = 1170. Adding 1369 ghost units, mu_hat must be at least 2539. I will set mu_hat to 2700 and sigma_hat to 400 to reflect high holiday volatility and ensure replenishment starts now.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P39-P40): demand increased from ~115 to 387 (+236%). Ghost pipeline remains at 1369 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42), which is the start of the holiday peak season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand in P39-P41 (241, 387, 348) confirms a significant shift from the previous baseline of ~115 units/period to a seasonal regime averaging ~325 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 2,728 units. However, this pipeline includes 1,369 'ghost units' (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled. To trigger the OR backend to order and maintain service levels during this holiday peak, mu_hat must be set to explicitly override the ghost pipeline. Total pipeline (2728) - ghost units (1369) = 1359 'real' in-transit units. To achieve a base stock that covers the peak demand (L+1 = 3 periods at ~450/period to be safe) plus the ghost gap, mu_hat is set to 2800. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility observed during promotional/peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Nov-Dec) established: P39-P41 average demand is 325 units/period (+182% over pre-peak average). Ghost inventory remains at 1369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). The product is in a high-demand holiday regime (Nov-Dec), with the last three periods averaging 349 units/period. On-hand inventory is very low at 35 units. The In-transit total is 2665 units, but 1369 of these (from P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) are confirmed lost/stalled, leaving an effective pipeline of 1296 units (P41: 1013, P42: 283). To maintain stock during this peak and counter the 'ghost' inventory that prevents the OR engine from ordering, mu_hat must be set explicitly high. Given the target lead time (L=2) and review period (1), we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~1050 units) plus enough to offset the 1369 lost units. Setting mu_hat to 2500 ensures the OR engine places an order to bridge the gap while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat=250 based on holiday demand swings).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Nov-Dec) remains strong: P40-P42 average demand is 349 units/period. Ghost pipeline remains at 1369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the middle of a sustained holiday demand peak for womens lingerie. Recent demand (P40-P43) has averaged 328 units/period. The current pipeline inventory stands at 1663 units, but 1369 of these are 'ghost' units from historical losses (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) that will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P42 (283 units) and P43 (11 units), totaling 294 units. With 782 units on hand and 'real' incoming supply of 294, our total effective inventory is 1076. At a holiday demand rate of ~330/period, this covers roughly 3 periods (matching L+1). To maintain this position and prevent stockouts as the holiday season continues, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the ghost pipeline and target a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime. To force the OR backend to order, mu_hat must be set above the ghost inventory threshold. I estimate the necessary base stock at (330 units * 3 periods) + safety stock (~200) = ~1190 units. Adding the 1369 ghost units, I set an explicit mu_hat of 2559. I use calculate for L as recent logistics (P40, P41) show the promised 2-period lead time is currently reliable.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak (P45, Dec 16). Demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) has averaged 338.4 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime compared to the pre-holiday average of ~115. On-hand inventory is 402 units. The 'In-transit' total of 1864 units includes 1369 units confirmed lost/stalled (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29). These 1369 units act as 'ghost inventory' that prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is explicitly set to exceed the ghost pipeline plus safety stock requirements. To trigger an order that covers the current demand (avg ~340) for the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 3), and to offset the 1369 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2400. This ensures the base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) is high enough to result in a positive order value despite the 1864 units 'in-transit'. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime remains sustained (P40-P44 average: 338 units/period). Ghost pipeline remains at 1369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) as of P45.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), the peak of the holiday shopping season. Recent demand (P40-P45) has stabilized into a high-demand holiday regime averaging 342 units/period. The 'ghost pipeline' of 1,369 units (from P9, P10, P13, P14, P29) persists in the system, causing the OR backend to believe there is significantly more inventory in transit than actually exists. To trigger a replenishment order that covers the current demand of ~342 units and accounts for the 1,369 missing units, mu_hat must be set to a level that compensates for this discrepancy. Setting mu_hat to 2,400 (representing (L+1) * 345 + 1369) ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the total perceived pipeline (1,926 units) plus on-hand (325 units), targeting a replenishment of approximately 150-200 units to maintain stock levels through the end of the year. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times, which has drifted between 2 and 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Nov-Dec) remains sustained with an average of 342 units/period over the last 6 periods. Ghost pipeline remains at 1,369 units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019/12/30), we are at the end of the holiday season. On-hand inventory is 0. The demand regime over the last 7 periods (P40-P46) has been consistently high, averaging 344 units per period (Holiday Peak). Total in-transit inventory is 2,143 units, but this includes 1,369 'ghost' units confirmed lost (P9, P10, P13, P14, P29). Subtracting these, the 'real' pipeline is 774 units (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Given the holiday peak is likely ending after late December, I expect demand to regress toward a post-holiday mean, but the current 0 on-hand status requires immediate replenishment. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the sustained holiday demand levels for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to ensure a high service level while the system still reports 1,369 units in the pipeline that will never arrive. To trigger an order despite the 1,369 ghost units, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 2,400. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for 3 periods of 350 demand ~ 1,050) + (Ghost Inventory 1,369) = 2,419. This will force the OR engine to place an order to cover the physical stockout.
