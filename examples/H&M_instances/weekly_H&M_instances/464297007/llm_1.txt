There is a downward trend in the recent samples, suggesting a current demand regime closer to ~150-200 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 arrive in P3. d) Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 0. I am starting with a stockout. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (the periods before the first shipment arrives). Given the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I want to be efficient but avoid stockouts. Total demand to cover (L+1) = 3 periods. Using a conservative estimate of 230 per period to account for the historical mean, I need ~690 units. I will order 700 to account for potential demand spikes and seed the pipeline.",

Period 1 actual demand was 159, which is lower than the historical average but within a reasonable range for this category. c) Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 700 placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at Period 4 decision). d) Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 700 in-transit. Since I cannot satisfy current demand until the first shipment arrives, and demand is occurring (P1 demand = 159), I need to build a pipeline to cover lead time (2) + current period (1) = 3 periods of demand. e) Forecasted demand is ~200 units/period. Target pipeline for 3 periods = 600 units. I already have 700 in-transit. However, to maintain a safety stock and account for the fact that Period 1 demand was not met (lost sales), I will order enough to ensure continuous coverage once the flow starts.

This is a staple basic item, though demand often fluctuates in the 'Womens Lingerie' category around Valentine's Day (which just passed) and seasonal transitions. (b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples average ~237. Realized demand in P1 (159) and P2 (373) averages 266. P2 demand (373) was significantly higher than the P1 (159) and the historical mean, likely reflecting post-Valentine's sales or typical weekly volatility. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (700 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3 (this period) and become visible/usable in P4. P2 order (200 units) should arrive in P4. (d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 900. Total Pipeline = 900.

Current inventory is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have missed sales in Period 13 due to a stockout. The pipeline shows 1000 units in-transit: Orders from P9 (280), P10 (280), P12 (100), and P13 (340). Based on the 'Carry-over Insight', lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. The P9 and P10 orders are now overdue (P9 is at L=5, P10 at L=4), suggesting a high probability they are lost or significantly delayed. If they arrive this period (P14), they cover demand; if not, we face continued stockouts. To protect against the likely loss of the 560 units from P9/P10 and the high holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I will place a conservative order to ensure future availability given the 2-3 period lead time, while acknowledging the 1000 units already in the pipeline.

The pipeline (In-transit: 2180) is extremely large due to recent aggressive ordering (P24: 500, P25: 250). However, history shows a high rate of shipment loss (P9, P10, P13, P14, P18 all lost). Excluding the confirmed/suspected lost units (P9, P10, P13, P14, P18), the active pipeline likely consists of P24 (500 units) and P25 (250 units).

  "rationale": "The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical data and the recent trend (P39: 241, P40: 387) indicate a clear upward demand shift consistent with the pre-holiday season for lingerie. This matches the 'late November/December' seasonal peak anticipated in previous periods. The baseline demand has moved from ~115 to approximately 300-400 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 410 units. While 'In-transit' shows a large number (2730), historical evidence confirms that the vast majority of these units are from lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P14, P18, P24, P29). The only reliable order currently in the pipeline is the 300 units ordered in Period 40, which should arrive between P41 and P43. To prepare for the Black Friday and December peak, additional inventory is required. Total inventory needed to cover the lead time (avg 2-3 periods) plus current demand is approx 1200 units (400 demand * 3 periods). Current reliable stock (On-hand 410 + P40 order 300 = 710) is insufficient for the expected holiday volume. An order of 500 units is placed to reach a safer stock position without over-investing in holding costs ($1/unit).",

Historical patterns show significant volatility during peak periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (62 units). The pipeline consists of orders from P40 (300) and P41 (500). Given the lead time variability (1-3 periods), the P40 order is likely to arrive in the current period (P42), but its arrival isn't guaranteed until the period concludes. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) of high holiday demand (estimated at ~400 units/period) and rebuild safety stock against potential shipment losses, a significant order is required. Total target inventory for 3 periods at 400 demand/period is 1200. Existing reliable pipeline + on-hand = 62 + 300 + 500 = 862.

Based on typical retail patterns, demand is expected to remain high through the weeks leading up to Christmas and possibly into the post-Christmas sales period.

The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P42 (500 units) and P43 (500 units), which are expected to arrive in P44 and P45 respectively (assuming the current stable 2-period lead time). Total inventory plus reliable pipeline (285 + 500 + 500) is 1285 units. Given the lead time (L=2), we need to cover demand for P44, P45, and P46.

While the current pipeline covers this, I will place a maintenance order of 300 units to ensure a safety buffer for potential late-December demand spikes or to mitigate the risk of another shipment loss, which has been a recurring issue for this SKU.",

Inventory is currently 0. Analyzing the pipeline: 1) The order from Period 42 (500 units) is one period overdue but historically likely to arrive soon or be lost. 2) The order from Period 43 (500 units) is expected to arrive during Period 45 (available for P45 demand). 3) The order from Period 44 (300 units) is expected to arrive during Period 46. Because orders placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 47 (the final period), they can only satisfy Period 47 demand. Any order placed in Period 46 or 47 will not arrive before the simulation ends. My total expected demand for the remaining periods (P45, P46, P47) is approximately 1,020 units (340 * 3). Total reliable in-transit inventory is 1,300 units (P42: 500, P43: 500, P44: 300). If all these arrive, I will have 1,300 units to cover ~1,020 units of demand, leaving a small surplus of ~280. However, if the overdue P42 order is lost (consistent with the frequent loss pattern), I will only have 800 units to cover 1,020 units. To mitigate the risk of stockouts in the final period while avoiding excessive holding costs on the final day, I will place a conservative order of 250 units to arrive in P47, ensuring I can cover the final period's demand even if one previous order is lost.",

We are currently entering the final peak week of December, followed by the post-holiday transition. On-hand inventory is 140 units.

The P43 order is expected to arrive during Period 46 (this period) but will only be visible in Period 47. Assuming the holiday demand remains high for Period 46 (~350 units) and potentially tapers slightly in Period 47 (~250-300 units), we need to ensure enough inventory is on the way to cover the (L+1) horizon. Total reliable pipeline + on-hand is 140 + 500 + 300 + 250 = 1190 units. Given the likely arrival of 500 units this period, the end-of-period inventory will be roughly 140 + 500 - 350 = 290 units.
