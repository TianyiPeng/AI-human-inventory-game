Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Underwear). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] shows a mean of 236.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 78. However, there is a clear downward trend in the last two periods. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the recent drop in demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the full historical context as we start, which results in mu_hat = 5 * 236.6 = 1183. This provides a balanced starting point before we observe more current period behavior.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The item is a 3-pack of cotton lace thongs (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand for the last five periods was [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], and Period 1 demand was 159. The average demand across these 6 points is approx 190. Current on-hand is 0 because the Period 1 order (367 units) is in transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 resolution and be visible in the Period 6 start. The stock-out in Period 1 (sold 0 despite 159 demand) was inevitable as on-hand started at 0. Since we have no lead-time conclude messages yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 6 samples show a slight downward trend compared to the earlier samples (267-307 vs 189-122-159). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this slightly lower mean of ~190, which prevents over-ordering while the pipeline is full.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. History shows a stock-out situation with 0 units on-hand. Total demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 159 and 373 respectively, with 0 sales due to lack of inventory. We currently have 719 units in-transit (367 from P1, 352 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the product is thong briefs (underwear) and it's late February/early March, there is no high seasonal volatility anticipated, but we must recover from the stock-out. The demand history supplied [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] plus recent periods [159, 373] suggests variable demand but no clear regime shift yet. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (all available data points including past and recent periods) to capture the recent high demand of 373 while tempering it with historical averages. This helps the OR backend establish a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time and current demand volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie), which typically exhibits steady demand with potential seasonal variation. Currently, we are in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (367 units), Period 2 (352 units), and Period 3 (394 units) are all in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and all historical demand so far (833 units total) has been lost due to stockout. Historical demand samples [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] plus recent observed demand [159, 373, 301] suggest a mean around 250-260. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent volatility and 'default' for lead time and sigma. Since no orders have arrived yet, actual lead time cannot be inferred; I will stick with the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie). Current Period is 5 (March 11, 2019). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 1,307 units in transit. Historical demand across the last 5 periods (including pre-game and game history) is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] plus recent game-period demands [159, 373, 301, 278], showing significant volatility but a steady mean. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order was placed in Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and be visible in the Period 6 start message. Since no orders have concluded yet, we maintain the default 'calculate' method for lead time. For demand, we observe a fairly stable regime; mu_hat and sigma_hat will use all available recent samples (N=9, including pre-game) to smooth out the volatility seen in Period 2 (373) and Period 4 (278).
