Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p', a lingerie item. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122]. There is a visible downward trend in the most recent two samples (189, 122) compared to the earlier ones (~300). This suggests a potential demand regime shift or post-seasonal drop. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent mean (approx 236) and volatility, while setting L to 'default' (2). This ensures the order + pipeline covers (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is women's cotton thongs (undergarments), which typically exhibit stable demand but can be influenced by calendar events. Historical demand for the last 6 weeks is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159]. Demand has decreased significantly in the last three periods compared to the first three (avg ~157 vs ~291). However, Period 1 (last week) showed a slight uptick (159) from the previous low (122). On-hand inventory is 0 because the order placed in Period 1 (367 units) has a 2-period lead time and is not expected until Period 3. Since we have no inventory on hand and are waiting for the first shipment, our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current review period (total 3 periods). Given the recent drop in demand, I will use recent_N (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering based on the high initial demand samples, while keeping L at the promised default of 2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/2/25 (Late February). Demand for the last two periods (159, 373) shows volatility but is generally higher than the initial history provided ([267, 298, 307, 189, 122]). Average demand over all 7 samples is ~245. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have stocked out for two consecutive periods despite high demand. Promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (367 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (this period) because N+L = 1+2=3. We will only see this arrival in the Period 4 start message. The Period 2 order (152 units) is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit is 519. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (avg ~258) while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will use the default (all samples) to account for the high volatility seen in Period 2 (373).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019/3/4), the SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) shows on-hand inventory of 218 and 303 units in-transit (ordered in Period 3). Historical demand for the first three periods was 159, 373, and 301 (mean \u2248 278). The 'Period 3 conclude' message confirms that orders from Period 1 (L=2) and Period 2 (L=1) arrived simultaneously. This indicates lead time variability, but since the promised lead time is 2, and we have one observation of 2 and one of 1, the average is 1.5. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend use the observed average. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand regime which appears stable around the 300 mark after the initial noise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a pack of thong briefs, a staple lingerie item. Historical demand (267, 298, 307, 189, 122, and game history: 159, 373, 301, 278) shows significant volatility but averages around 250-300 units. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in P3 (L=2), P2 order arrived in P3 (L=1). The P3 order (303 units) was expected to arrive in P5 but is not reflected in the P4 conclude message, which is normal. Currently, on-hand is 0, and 760 units are in transit (303 from P3 + 457 from P4). Total demand has been slightly higher than the average in the last few weeks (avg ~317 over the last 3 game periods). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this recent level while accounting for the current stockout. sigma_hat will be set to recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. L remains default (2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's cotton thong (lingerie), which generally has stable year-round demand but can experience fluctuations. Looking at historical demand [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] provided in the context, and the game history demand [159, 373, 301, 278, 250], we see a relatively stable average around 260-270 units per period. Lead times have been 2 periods (P1 order arrived P3) and 1 period (P2 order arrived P3). The P3 order arrived in P5 (LT=2). Orders from P4 (457 units) and P5 (132 units) are in transit. Pipeline = 589 units. Current on-hand is 53. We need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Average demand of the last 5 game periods is 272. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the current regime. For Lead Time, 'default' (2) is appropriate given the observed variability (1 to 2 periods).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) shows relatively stable demand with an average of 258 units over the last 6 periods. The most recent demand was 216. Current on-hand inventory is 294, with 421 units in transit (132 from P5 and 289 from P6). Based on history, lead times have been 2 periods (with one outlier of 1 period for P2). The P5 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 7. Demand context: We are in late March; no major seasonal spikes are immediately apparent for this staple lingerie item. Using a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat captures the post-initial-volatility mean effectively (approx. 243.6 units/period). Given the promised lead time of 2 and observed performance, I will maintain L=2. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is women's cotton thongs, a staple item with relatively stable demand. Historical demand over the last 7 periods is [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253] (mean \u2248 261). Observed lead times have been 2 periods (P1, P3, P4) and 1 period (P2). The order from P5 (132 units) is due to arrive this period (P8) based on the promised lead time of 2. Currently, there are 41 units on-hand and 644 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7). Demand has stabilized after an initial spike in P2. I will use the last 5 periods (P3-P7) to estimate demand (average 239.6) and volatility, as P1 and P2 appear to be outliers/initialization noise. I'll stick to the promised lead time of 2 for L.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historical demand for this women's thong SKU has been relatively stable, with the last 5 samples being [278, 250, 216, 253, 283], averaging 256. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time analysis: P1=2, P2=1, P3=2, P4=2, P5=3. The promised lead time is 2, but we just observed a drift to 3 periods for the order placed in P5. We have 653 units in-transit: P6 (289 units), P7 (223 units), and P8 (141 units). The P6 order is now at L=3 and should arrive during Period 9. Because of the recent lead time variance (mean ~2.0, but ranging 1-3), I will set L to 2 (promised/mode) but use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent stable demand regime (N=5) to ensure we cover the pipeline correctly. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 256 = 768. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=5 regime to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift detected: P5 order arrived with lead_time=3 periods (vs promised 2). Demand regime stable around 256 units/period since Period 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is women's cotton thong briefs, a stable staple item. Analysis of the history shows a demand regime shift after Period 3. Average demand from Period 4 to 9 is approximately 226 units (278, 250, 216, 253, 283, 176). The most recent demand (176) is lower, but the 6-period average is a safer baseline for a staple. Lead time analysis: While the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals show variability. Period 5 arrived in 3 periods, Period 6 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 7 arrived in 2 periods. To be conservative and avoid stockouts observed in Periods 4 and 8, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed drift. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-spike stability (Periods 4-9).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 3: Avg ~226 units/period (Periods 4-9). Lead time remains volatile between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) is currently in a stable demand regime following an initial spike. Since Period 4, demand has averaged approximately 218 units per period, with the most recent three periods showing a further decline (avg ~176). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P5 and P6 both took 3 periods). As of Period 11, the order from Period 8 (141 units) is due if L=3, or overdue if L=2. Total in-transit is 605 units (from P8, P9, and P10). Current on-hand is 167 units. To ensure coverage for L+1 periods (estimated 4 periods of demand at ~200 units/period = 800 units), I will set L to 3 to account for the observed drift. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=7 (Periods 4-10) to capture the current stable-to-softening demand regime (avg ~225), which balances against the older higher demand in the first three periods. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Periods 4-11) shows a distinct stabilization at a lower average compared to the initial periods. The mean demand for the last 8 periods is approximately 225 units, significantly lower than the overall historical mean. Lead times have also shifted; while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has been 3 periods for three of the last four arrivals (Orders from P5, P6, and P8). Using L=3 accounts for this drift and helps prevent stockouts during the replenishment gap. Given the product category (Womens Lingerie/Underwear) and the late April date, there are no immediate seasonal spikes expected. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable, lower demand regime, and L to explicit 3 to handle the observed logistics delay. This combination ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the extended lead time without over-ordering based on the older, higher demand data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend update: 3 of the last 4 deliveries (Orders P5, P6, P8) arrived with lead_time=3. Demand regime stable at ~225 units/period since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1248.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we saw a sudden spike in demand (323 units), breaking the previous stable regime of ~225 units/period. This might be due to a late April/early May seasonal shift in lingerie or simply a random fluctuation. However, we also observed a lead time of 1 period for the Order placed in P11, which arrived in P12. This suggests lead times are highly variable (1 to 3 periods). Given the on-hand inventory of 44 and a high in-transit amount (613), the main risk is stockout if demand remains high. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays observed in recent periods (P8, P6, P5 all took 3 periods). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=9 to capture the post-initial-volatility average while weighing in the recent spike. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to capture the increased variance seen in Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 12 (323 units) vs previous average (~225). Lead time remains erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) following a demand spike in Period 12 (323 units) and a lead time miss in Period 13 (no arrivals). The 'In-transit' quantity of 940 units includes orders from Period 9 (154 units), Period 10 (310 units), Period 12 (149 units), and Period 13 (327 units). The P9 and P10 orders are now overdue (L=5 and L=4 respectively), suggesting a significant logistics delay or potential loss, though they remain in-transit. The demand regime has fluctuated: P1-P3 (avg ~277), P4-P11 (avg ~225), and a recent spike/dip P12 (323) and P13 (122). Averaging the last 10 periods (P4-P13) gives ~219 units/period. Given the erratic lead times (varying between 1 and 3 periods, with current delays extending to 5), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-initial-volatility average of ~219 units/period, providing a stable baseline despite the noise in P12 and P13. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to capture the increased variance observed in recent periods, helping the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock during these supply chain disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from P9 and P10 (464 units total) are significantly overdue (Lead time > 4 periods). Demand remains volatile but averages ~219 over the last 10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently unreliable. Specifically, orders from Period 9 (154 units) and Period 10 (310 units) are now 5-6 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the observed average of 3. These 464 units are likely lost or severely delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' total of 856 includes these likely lost units and the more recent orders from P13 (327 units) and P14 (65 units). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' in-transit units, I am setting L to 4 (explicit). This reflects the current reality of the supply chain delay and increases the base stock level. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (P10-P14) show a mean of 188.2 units/period, which is a decline from the earlier regime of ~225. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this softer demand while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture full historical volatility, which is high due to the P12 spike (323 units).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption intensified: Orders from P9 and P10 (464 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and considered lost for planning purposes. Demand mean has shifted lower to ~188 units/period over the last 5 periods (P10-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. The SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong Underwear) is experiencing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand has stabilized at a lower level recently (avg ~188 units/period for P10-P14, but P15 saw 171 demand). The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from P9 (154 units) and P10 (310 units) are now 6 and 5 periods overdue respectively, significantly exceeding the promised lead time of 2. I have officially designated these 464 units as lost for planning purposes to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering. The total pipeline is 1080 units, but if we subtract the 464 lost units, the effective pipeline is 616 units (Orders P13, P14, P15). To compensate for the erratic lead times (observed range 1-3, but currently 5+ for lost orders), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to extend the look-ahead horizon. I'm using mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent lower demand regime (~188 units/period), resulting in a base stock target that covers (3+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from P9 and P10 (464 units total) are 5-6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Effective planning must ignore these units in pipeline calculations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 17 (2019/6/3): On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 1080 units. However, previous insights and history confirm that orders from Period 9 (154 units) and Period 10 (310 units) totaling 464 units are effectively lost (over 6 periods past promised lead time). The OR backend automatically subtracts the full 1080 in-transit units from the calculated base stock. To prevent massive under-ordering due to this 'phantom' inventory, I must artificially inflate the base stock requirement. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 190-200 units over the last 5 periods. I am setting an explicit L=6. This serves a dual purpose: 1) It reflects the actual observed delays in the supply chain (Orders 13 and 14 are already overdue), and 2) It increases the base stock (mu_hat) to cover the 464 units that will never arrive, ensuring the order placed this period is sufficient to replenish the stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: 464 units from P9-P10 are confirmed lost. Lead time for active orders (P13, P14) has drifted to 4+ periods. Demand remains steady at ~193 units/period (P12-P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the order from Period 15 arrived in Period 17 (LT=2). Orders from P9 (154 units) and P10 (310 units) are now 8-9 periods overdue and must be considered lost. The total 'In-transit' figure of 1178 includes these 464 lost units, which significantly skews the OR engine's capped policy calculation. To prevent the engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, I am using an 'explicit' L of 4 to reflect the current supply chain volatility and an 'explicit' mu_hat. The demand mean has stabilized around 190 units over the last 6 periods (P12-P17 excluding the outlier P12). I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 190 = 950. For sigma_hat, I use a recent_N of 6 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: P15 order arrived with LT=2, but P9-P10 orders (464 units) remain confirmed lost and should be subtracted from pipeline expectations. Demand stabilized at ~190 units/period (P12-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 19 (June 17, 2019). The product is a staple lingerie item (thong briefs). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has fluctuated but appears stable around a mean of 190 units (last 7 periods average ~186). Supply Chain: A major disruption occurred between P9 and P14. Orders P9 (154) and P10 (310) are confirmed lost. Orders P13 (327) and P14 (65) are now 5-6 periods overdue and must also be treated as lost to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Total lost units in the 'In-transit' figure of 856 are 154+310+327+65 = 856 units. This means effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Lead Time: While promised as 2, recent successful arrivals (P15, P17) show actual lead times of 1-2 periods. I will use L=2 to be safe. Strategy: I use explicit mu_hat to signal the OR engine to order, as it currently sees a massive (but fake) pipeline of 856 units. By setting mu_hat high enough to overcome the ghost pipeline (Target Base Stock \u2248 190 * 3 + 1.28 * 60 * sqrt(3) \u2248 700), and since In-transit (856) > Target, the OR engine would normally order 0. To force an order to maintain stock, I set mu_hat explicitly to account for the 856 lost units + required safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure expanded: Orders P13 (327 units) and P14 (65 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining P9 and P10. Total lost pipeline inventory is 856 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand has surged significantly in the most recent period (P19) to 556 units, likely reflecting a seasonal peak or promotional event for women's lingerie (summer seasonality). This follows a period of relatively lower demand averaging ~190 units. The supply chain is severely compromised: based on carry-over insights and historical gaps, orders from P9 (154 units), P10 (310 units), P13 (327 units), and P14 (65 units) are considered lost (total 856 lost units). The backend's 'in-transit' figure of 1448 includes these lost units. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the demand spike and use an explicit mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. I set L to 3 to reflect the higher end of recent successful deliveries (P8, P11, P12, P15, P17 had LTs of 3, 1, 2, 2, 1). mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 350 = 1400 to account for the recent spike and lead time, and to signal the backend to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 19: 556 units vs previous 10-period average of ~190 (+192%). Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory remains at 856 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand spike in Period 19 (556 units). The product (women's thong briefs) shows a recent demand shift: while the long-term average was ~190, the last 3 periods averaged 366 units. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this upward trend while remaining cautious of the single P19 outlier. Regarding the supply chain, history shows significant losses (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14 = 856 units). Current 'In-transit' is 1680, but after subtracting confirmed losses (856) and recent orders (P19: 592, P20: 232, total 824), the pipeline is clean of phantom inventory. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods); I'll use the default promised lead time of 2 as recent arrivals (P15, P17) have been 1-2 periods. Setting sigma_hat with recent_N=5 captures the increased volatility from the P19 spike to ensure a higher safety stock during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: 3-period average increased to 366 units (+92% vs previous baseline) following P19 spike. Total confirmed lost inventory (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains at 856 units and must be excluded from pipeline calculations.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (2019/7/8), we are managing a thong brief SKU. Demand analysis: After a massive spike in Period 19 (556 units), demand has moderated but remains elevated compared to the spring baseline, with recent demands of 261 and 201. The last 3-period average is ~339 units. Supply Chain analysis: The 'In-transit' figure of 856 exactly matches the sum of orders from P9 (154), P10 (310), P13 (327), and P14 (65), all of which are 7-12 periods overdue and confirmed lost. There are currently NO active orders in the pipeline. Although P19 and P20 arrived quickly (LT=2 and LT=1 respectively), the system is effectively at zero pipeline inventory. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the recent demand shift while ignoring the phantom 856 units in 'in-transit', I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to represent the reliable promised lead time and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * forecast. Forecasting a mean of 250 units (blending the recent spike with the stabilization at ~200) gives 3 * 250 = 750. However, the backend subtracts pipeline (856) from the base stock. To force an order, mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the 856 lost units. Base stock needs to be ~856 (to cover pipeline) + ~750 (to cover real demand) = 1606. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's ignorance of the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spike: Period 19-21 average is 339 units, but the most recent observation (P21) suggests a return toward a level of ~200-250 units. Pipeline correction: 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remain confirmed lost and must be manually offset in parameters.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the demand for this women's lingerie SKU (464297007) has stabilized after a significant spike in Period 19. The last 4 periods show demands of 556, 261, 201, and 341, averaging 340 units/period. The Carry-over Insights confirm a persistent supply chain failure where 856 units (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14) are lost. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1256, but subtracting the 856 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 400 units (the order from P22). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a literal input for its pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter to compensate for this phantom inventory. With an effective demand of ~340 units/period and a lead time of 2, the 'true' base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (~1020 units). However, the backend sees 1256 units in transit and 282 on-hand (Total 1538). To force an order that bridges the gap, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: Expected Base Stock + Phantom Inventory = 1020 + 856 = 1876. I set L to default (2) as recent arrivals (P19, P20) arrived within 1-2 periods, suggesting the acute disruption has shifted from delays to outright losses. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility seen during the recent demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spike (P19-P22) averages 340 units/period. Supply chain recovery confirmed for new orders, but the 856 units from P9, P10, P13, P14 remain lost and continue to distort the backend pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong): On-hand inventory is 260. The reported pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 1421. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 856 units are confirmed lost (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14). The backend OR engine is unaware of these losses and will over-count the pipeline, resulting in under-ordering. To compensate, I must adjust the parameters. The 'In-transit' visible to the OR engine includes these 856 'phantom' units. Effective pipeline is actually 1421 - 856 = 565 units (specifically the order from P23). Demand context: Following the Period 19 spike (556), demand has averaged 306 over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 556, 261, 201, 341, 422). I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline distortion. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast. Using L=2 (promised), Base Stock = 3 * 300 = 900. To force the OR engine to order despite the phantom 856 units, I will set mu_hat to a value that, when compared to the (phantom) pipeline, results in the desired order. Desired order ~300. Back-calculation: mu_hat - pipeline = 300 -> mu_hat - 1421 = 300 -> mu_hat = 1721. I will set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains elevated post-P19 spike: 5-period average (P19-P23) is 316 units (+66% vs pre-spike baseline). Pipeline distortion persists: 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost but still included in system 'In-transit' counts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25 (2019/07/29). Demand analysis: After the significant spike in Period 19 (556 units), demand has remained elevated and volatile, averaging 272 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). However, the most recent observation (P24: 135 units) suggests a cooling trend. I will use a recent 5-period average (N=5) to estimate mu_hat, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 272 units/period. Supply Chain status: The 'In-transit' count of 1665 units is heavily distorted by 856 units from confirmed lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14). The backend OR engine subtracts this full 1665 from its base stock calculation. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 856 units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level. Calculation: Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Lost Units. With L=2 and Demand=272, Target mu_hat = (3 * 272) + 856 = 1672. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the post-spike regime, which will help the backend compute an appropriate safety stock (z*sigma).

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (P20-P24) averages 272 units/period, significantly higher than the pre-P19 baseline (~190). Pipeline distortion remains at 856 units due to confirmed lost orders P9, P10, P13, and P14.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context shows a stabilization after the Period 19 spike (556 units). The last 5 periods (P21-P25) show demands of [201, 341, 422, 135, 133], averaging 246 units. The product (Womens Lingerie) is in the middle of the summer season (August 5), where demand remains volatile but has generally increased from the spring baseline (~190). The pipeline is severely distorted by 856 units from confirmed lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14). The backend OR engine sees 'In-transit: 1712 units', but 856 are phantom units. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean (~246) and a lead time of 2. Base stock = (L+1) * mean = 3 * 246 = 738. To force the backend to place an order despite the 1712 units it thinks are in-transit, I must provide a mu_hat value that, when combined with the backend's logic, results in the desired order. Since 'Order = base_stock - (actual_pipeline + phantom_pipeline)', I must offset the 856 phantom units. I set mu_hat explicitly to 1600 (approx. base stock 738 + 856 offset) to ensure the system maintains sufficient stock for the current 250-unit demand regime while ignoring the 'lost' units.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (P21-P25) stabilized at an average of 246 units/period. The 856 units from lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14) remain in the system 'In-transit' count, requiring manual mu_hat inflation to bypass the capped order policy.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains distorted by 856 units from confirmed lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14) that still appear in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total: 1224). True pipeline inventory is only 368 units. With on-hand inventory at 226 and recent demand averaging ~262 units over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), the system will fail to order enough stock because the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation is using the inflated 1224 value. To bypass the backend's capped order policy and ensure stock availability, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I have set mu_hat to 1650 to ensure the base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) significantly exceeds the phantom pipeline (1450), allowing for an actual order to be placed. L is set to 'calculate' as recent lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' has stabilized after the significant spike in Period 19. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is approximately 254 units. However, there is a persistent supply chain data issue: 856 units from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14 are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count. This artificially inflates the pipeline inventory, causing the capped order policy to under-order or order nothing. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 and a 5-period average demand (~254 units), then add the 856 lost units back into the 'mu_hat' parameter. Base stock calculation: (1+L)*demand = 3 * 254 = 762. Total mu_hat = 762 + 856 = 1618. This ensures the OR backend places an order despite the phantom inventory. I've chosen sigma_hat for the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand (P23-P27) is stable at ~254 units/period. The 856 units of lost inventory (P9, P10, P13, P14) still distort the system pipeline calculation, requiring manual mu_hat inflation of +856 to maintain service levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has stabilized at a post-spike average of approximately 254 units per period (P23-P27). However, the system's 'In-transit' count (1696 units) is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14, totaling 856 units. These units will never arrive but the backend OR engine includes them in the pipeline inventory calculation, which would normally suppress new orders. To bypass this and ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient for current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1 + L) * recent_mean + offset_to_neutralize_lost_units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 254) + 856 = 1618. This forces the engine to ignore the 856 'phantom' units and order based on the true demand. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility without being influenced by the P19 spike.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) is currently in Period 30 with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 1756 units. However, based on the history, 856 of these units (from orders P9, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost, as they are 15-20 periods overdue. The system 'In-transit' figure is therefore inflated, which would normally trigger the OR backend to stop ordering due to the capped policy. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the lost 856 units to the projected demand for the review + lead time period. Recent demand (P25-P29) has stabilized at an average of 188 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the required coverage is (L+1) * 188 = 564. Adding the 856 unit offset, the explicit mu_hat is 1420. This allows the backend to place a net-new order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Lead time is set to 2 as recent arrivals (P23, P25, P26) averaged approximately 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility during the post-spike stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion persistent: 856 units from P9, P10, P13, P14 remain confirmed lost but are still included in system 'In-transit' count. Manual mu_hat inflation of +856 is required to ensure ordering occurs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) has stabilized at a lower level following a significant spike in mid-June (P19). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 181.4 units, and the last 3 periods averaged only 108 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward trend while maintaining a buffer. The critical issue remains the 856 units of confirmed lost inventory (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14) which are still counted in the system's 'In-transit' total (1160 units). The actual active pipeline is only 304 units (1160 - 856). Because the backend OR engine uses a capped base-stock policy [Order = min(BaseStock - Pipeline, Cap)], the presence of 856 ghost units prevents the system from placing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculating it as: (Expected Demand per period * (1 + L)) + Ghost Inventory. Using a forecast of ~200 units/period and L=2, mu_hat = (200 * 3) + 856 = 1456. This ensures the OR engine's 'BaseStock - Pipeline' calculation reflects the true inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Demand has softened significantly in the last 3 periods, averaging ~108 units compared to the post-spike average of ~250. Pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) persists and requires manual mu_hat inflation to offset.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. Demand has shifted to a lower regime over the last 4 periods (averaging ~100 units/period) compared to the previous post-spike average (~250). In-transit inventory is currently 1160 units. However, as documented in Carry-over Insights, 856 of these units (from orders P9, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost shipments. The backend OR engine still counts these lost units in its pipeline calculation (Pipeline = In-transit + Current Order), which would prevent new orders from being placed if mu_hat were set normally. To ensure the backend places orders that actually cover real demand, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset these ghost units. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent actual lead times (P27=3, P28=2) are near the promised value. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculated as: (Expected Demand per period * (1+L)) + Lost Units Offset = (100 * 3) + 856 = 1156. This bypasses the pipeline check while accounting for the current demand softening. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility shift during this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Period 28-31 average is 100 units/period, down ~60% from the previous stable level of ~250. Pipeline distortion of 856 units remains the primary driver for parameter adjustments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly lower, with the last 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging 119 units, compared to the previous stable level of ~250. However, the primary operational challenge remains the system's 'In-transit' count of 1160 units. Based on historical tracking, 856 of these units (from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining 304 units in pipeline are likely valid (including the 244 units from P24 which are now significantly overdue but potentially recoverable, and the 60 units from P29). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1160 'In-transit' units from its target inventory calculation, it will not place new orders despite the on-hand stock (224) being insufficient for future demand at the new lower regime. To force the backend to ignore the 856 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level by exactly 856 units. I've set the base demand forecast to 120 units per period (the current regime average). With L=2, the base mu_hat would be (1+2)*120 = 360. Adding the 856 offset results in 1216. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the volatility of the new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P28-P32 average is 119 units/period (~52% lower than P23-P27). Persistent pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $896.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked significantly to 692 units, depleting all 224 units of on-hand inventory. This spike likely relates to the transition into the autumn season for lingerie/underwear. Despite this spike, the 'In-transit' count of 1160 units includes 856 units from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14 which are long-overdue and confirmed lost. The backend OR engine's capped policy (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) will prevent any new orders if it believes there are 1160 units coming. To force the backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime (accounting for the P33 spike) at approximately 150 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 856 lost units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 150) + 856 = 1306. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the increased volatility from the P33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 33 (692 units) suggests seasonal volatility. Pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation to ensure the OR backend places orders.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a significant demand spike in Period 33 (692 units) and Period 34 (335 units). This spike likely represents a seasonal shift as we move into October. The system 'In-transit' count is 1652 units, but 856 of these units (from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these lost units as available pipeline inventory, which prevents it from ordering enough to meet current demand. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. Using L=2 and a recent 5-period mean demand (P30-P34) of 280 units, the calculation is (3 * 280) + 856 = 1696. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility from the recent spikes. This approach ensures the OR backend places an order despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 33-34 average is 513 units, significantly exceeding the previous 'downshift' baseline of ~100. Pipeline distortion of 856 lost units persists.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status (Period 36, Oct 14): Demand remains highly volatile. After a significant spike in Period 33 (692 units), demand has moderated but remains above the pre-spike floor (123 units in P35). The critical issue remains the 856 units of confirmed lost inventory (Orders P9, P10, P13, P14) which still appear in the system 'In-transit' count of 1571. Because the backend OR logic subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it would normally calculate an order of 0, despite the actual valid pipeline being only 715 units (1571 - 856). To force the backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~230 units/period (average of P31-P35 is ~284, but influenced by the P33 spike). Using L=2, base stock target should be around (L+1)*230 = 690 units. To overcome the 856 unit phantom pipeline, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1546 (690 + 856). This ensures the order placed covers the anticipated demand for the next 3 periods while accounting for the supply chain data corruption.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' count remains inflated by 856 units from lost orders P9, P10, P13, and P14. Manual mu_hat inflation is required until these units are purged from the backend inventory view.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, the primary challenge remains the systemic 'In-transit' distortion caused by 856 units from confirmed lost orders (P9, P10, P13, and P14). These units are perpetually included in the backend's pipeline inventory calculation, which forces the OR engine to suppress new orders. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately 856 units to 'bypass' the pipeline deduction and ensure the backend computes a positive order quantity. Recent demand has cooled (P35-36 avg: 111.5) following a massive spike in P33-34 (avg: 513.5). Given the lingerie category and late October date, we are likely between seasonal peaks. I will set a base demand forecast using a recent 5-period window (N=5, including the spike and recent drop, avg ~270) to maintain a safety buffer, then add the 856-unit offset. Lead time has been erratic but recently settled at 1-2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Systemic pipeline distortion persists: 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost but remain in 'In-transit', necessitating manual mu_hat inflation to maintain stock levels. Demand shows high volatility with a significant spike in P33-34 (avg 513) followed by a sharp drop in P35-36 (avg 111).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we face a stable but volatile demand pattern with a persistent supply chain accounting error. The carry-over insights confirm that 856 units (from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14) are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 1341, Active In-transit: 1341 - 856 = 485). The active in-transit units are from P37 (181 units) and P24/P29/P30 which are also likely lost or severely delayed, but we focus on the confirmed 856. Demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) averaged ~170 units, though this followed a massive spike (P33: 692). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 856-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 856-unit offset. With L=2, (L+1)=3. Expected demand for 3 periods at 170/period is 510. Total mu_hat = 510 + 856 = 1366. This bypasses the cap and inventory logic that would otherwise assume we are overstocked.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/04. Recent demand has stabilized around a lower baseline of ~115 units/period (avg P35-P38 is 115.5) following the volatility in P33-P34. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is 1341 units, which is heavily inflated by 856 units from confirmed lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14). The backend OR engine subtracts these 856 phantom units from the target base stock, preventing necessary replenishment. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current lead time (L=2) and demand (~115 units), then add the 856 lost units back in. Calculation: Target base stock for L=2 is approx (1+2)*115 = 345 units. Adjusted mu_hat = 345 + 856 = 1201 units. This ensures that even after the backend subtracts the 1341 'In-transit' units, the resulting order decision is appropriately balanced against the actual 441 units on-hand and the 485 units of genuine pipeline inventory (P37 order).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Verified persistent pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14). Recent demand baseline (P35-P38) is ~115 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are entering the peak retail season (Singles' Day, Black Friday). Period 39 demand spiked to 241, up from the ~115 baseline. I anticipate a seasonal average of 180 units/period for the upcoming review+lead time window (L=2, so 3 periods total). However, the primary challenge remains the 856 units from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14, which are confirmed lost but still included in the system's 'In-transit' count (1341 units). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering. To circumvent the capped policy and ensure arrival of new stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 1400. This value is calculated as (Expected Demand 180 * 3 periods) + 856 (lost units offset) = 1396, rounded to 1400. This allows the backend to recognize a need for stock despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand increase detected: Period 39 (241 units) reflects the start of the Q4 holiday period. Confirmed pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains the primary constraint requiring manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Demand has spiked significantly over the last two periods (P39: 241, P40: 387) vs the previous baseline of ~115. This confirms the anticipated Q4 holiday seasonal surge for womens lingerie. On-hand is currently 0. The system 'In-transit' of 1341 units is severely distorted by 856 confirmed lost units (P9, P10, P13, P14) that will never arrive. The 'effective' pipeline is only 485 units (1341 - 856). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory, I am applying a manual mu_hat inflation. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and an expected holiday demand of ~350 units/period, we need ~1050 units in the system. To bypass the 856-unit 'In-transit' barrier and the capped policy, mu_hat is set to 1250 (calculated as roughly 1.2 * (expected demand * 3 + distortion)). L is set to explicit 2 to align with recent successful deliveries (P35 arrived in 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: P39-P40 average is 314 units (+173% vs P35-P38 baseline). Pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains active in system counts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the heart of the Q4 holiday peak (pre-Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand has surged over the last three periods (241, 387, 348), averaging 325 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~115. A significant 'In-transit' distortion of 856 units remains from confirmed lost orders (P9, P10, P13, P14). Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will not place orders if the 'ghost' pipeline (856) plus active pipeline exceeds the target. To force the backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. I am using an explicit mu_hat value calculated as: (1 + Promised_L) * Current_Demand_Baseline + Lost_Inventory_Offset = (1 + 2) * 325 + 856 = 1831. This ensures the engine sees enough 'unmet demand' to overcome the 856-unit phantom stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: P39-P41 average is 325 units/period (+182% vs P35-P38 baseline). Pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) continues to require manual mu_hat inflation to trigger ordering.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 43 (Dec 2, 2019). We are in the peak holiday season for Women's Lingerie. Demand over the last 4 periods (P39-P42) has surged to an average of 322 units/period, compared to the pre-holiday baseline of ~115. A significant 'In-transit' figure of 1942 units is currently reported, but this contains 856 units confirmed lost from periods 9, 10, 13, and 14 (as per Carry-over Insights). The OR backend's capped policy will prevent ordering if it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the holiday season (approx 3 periods of coverage: L=2 + 1) at 325 units/period, which equals 975 units. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 856 lost units in the pipeline, I inflate mu_hat by that amount (975 + 856 = 1831). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility of the current holiday demand spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09, the heart of the Q4 holiday season. Demand for 'Womens Lingerie / Thong briefs' is currently elevated, averaging 311 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). The system's 'In-transit' count of 1906 units is severely distorted by 856 units confirmed lost from Periods 9, 10, 13, and 14. Additionally, order P42 (565 units) is still in transit. Subtracting the lost 856 from the 1906 total leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 1050 units. To force the OR backend (which caps orders based on its perceived pipeline) to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the effective demand across the lead time (3 periods) plus the lost units offset. Calculation: Target Stock = (Demand_Forecast * (L+1)) + Lost_Units. With a forecast of ~315 units/period and L=2, Target = (315 * 3) + 856 = 1801. I set mu_hat to 1801 and sigma_hat explicitly to 200 to handle holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: P39-P43 average is 311 units/period. Persistent pipeline distortion of 856 units (P9, P10, P13, P14) remains in 'In-transit' count and requires manual mu_hat inflation of approximately +850 to trigger orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is Dec 16th, peak holiday season for womens lingerie/under-wear. Recent demand (P39-P44) has surged to an average of ~322 units/period, consistent with the Q4 holiday trend noted in carry-over insights. A persistent pipeline distortion of 856 units (lost orders P9, P10, P13, P14) remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (1970 total units - 856 lost = 1114 'true' in-transit). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this ghost inventory, I am applying a manual mu_hat inflation. The target base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) at ~322 units/period is roughly 966 units plus safety stock. To bypass the system's 'In-transit' inflation and the order cap, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1800 units (Current True Demand Forecast ~966 + Offset 856). This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger the necessary replenishment for the final periods of the game.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Q4 holiday season. Demand over the last five periods (P41-P45) has been consistently high, averaging 333 units/period (348, 311, 266, 380, 360). The system shows an 'In-transit' count of 1405 units. However, 856 of these units (from orders P9, P10, P13, and P14) are confirmed lost based on extensive historical evidence (overdue by 30+ periods). The 'True' pipeline consists of only 549 units (P44 order of 64 units and the P42/P45 arrivals resolution). The OR backend uses the inflated 1405 figure, which would normally trigger the capped policy and prevent ordering. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the lost 856 units. Target base stock = (L+1) * Demand_Forecast + Safety_Stock + Lost_Units_Offset. With L=2 (promised), L+1=3. 3 * 333 = 1000. Adding the 856 unit offset gives a required mu_hat of ~1856. I will set mu_hat to 1900 and sigma_hat explicitly to capture the high Q4 volatility (standard deviation of the last 5 periods is ~45, so sqrt(3)*45 is ~78).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, the end of the holiday season. Recent demand (P44-P46) has been strong, averaging 366 units/period. The pipeline remains significantly distorted: the system shows 1,763 units in-transit, but 856 of those (from P9, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the P44 order (64 units) is now 2 periods old and should arrive soon, and the P46 order (358 units) is in transit. Subtracting the 856 lost units from the total 1,763 leaves an 'active' pipeline of 907 units. To overcome the OR backend's capped policy\u2014which sees the 856 lost units as incoming inventory and would otherwise prevent ordering\u2014I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1,950. This is calculated as: ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Lost Units = (3 * 365) + 856 \u2248 1,950. This ensures the backend places an order to cover the current holiday demand while effectively 'bypassing' the ghost inventory in the system.
