Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie Thong). Initial on-hand and in-transit units are 0. The historical demand for the past 5 periods is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], showing a significant downward trend recently. The promised lead time is 4. Given there is no observation history yet for actual lead times, I will use the 'default' method for L (which defaults to the promised 4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), using 'default' would average the volatile 5-period history. Since demand plummeted from ~300 to ~120 in two weeks, a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 captures the most recent regime shift more effectively than a full history average, while still providing some variance safety.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is a 3-pack of cotton lace thongs (Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p), a staple lingerie item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we placed an order for 361 units; however, since the lead time is at least 1 period, no units arrived in Period 1, resulting in 159 units of lost demand. The past demand samples [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the Period 1 demand of 159 suggest a mean demand of approximately 223 units per period (std dev ~75). Given the item is basic cotton underwear, we don't anticipate a massive seasonal spike on Feb 18th, though demand remains steady. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (including Period 1's 159) to reflect the recent demand levels while accounting for the promised 4-period lead time (L+1=5 periods). L is set to default (4). Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 713 units currently in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the game is only at Period 3, the orders placed in Period 1 (361 units) and Period 2 (352 units) are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively, based on the lead-time definition (P1 order arrives during P5 resolution). Demand over the last 5 historical periods [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the first two game periods [159, 373] shows a mean of approximately 245. The spike to 373 in Period 2 suggests volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand estimation to capture the recent dynamics (avg ~250) across the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will retain the default promised lead time of 4 until arrival data proves otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie), which typically exhibits steady demand but currently shows significant stockouts (Sold=0) due to lead time. Initial historical demand (267, 298, 307, 189, 122) varies, and observations from Periods 1-3 show demands of 159, 373, and 301 respectively (Mean ~230). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 conclusion (visible P6), and orders placed in P2 in P6 conclusion (visible P7). Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 1118 (the sum of P1-P3 orders). Using recent_N=5 for demand statistics better captures the recent demand levels observed in the game periods compared to the older pre-game history. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a staple underwear item. Historical demand (including the provided 5 past samples: 267, 298, 307, 189, 122 and the 4 recent periods: 159, 373, 301, 278) shows high volume and significant variability. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not yet arrived as of the end of Period 4, which is expected (a 4-period lead time means the P1 order arrives during P5 and is visible at the start of P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 1342 units in-transit (P1: 361, P2: 352, P3: 405, P4: 224). The mean of the last 9 demand observations is approx 255. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent volatility and mean, keeping the lead time at the promised 4 periods as no evidence yet suggests a deviation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 for SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong 3p). The item has a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms that the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5, validating the 4-period lead time. As of Period 6, we have 111 units on-hand and 1,068 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Recent demand over the last 5 periods has been [159, 373, 301, 278, 250], averaging 272.2 units per period. Prior demands [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] show lower levels, suggesting a shift upwards since the start of the simulated periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent higher-demand regime while using the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed lead time matches the promised value.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton lace-trim thongs, a staple lingerie item. Promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 and 6 (orders from P1 and P2 arrived exactly on time). Historical demand across 11 samples (5 pre-game + 6 in-game) is [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216], averaging approximately 251 units per period. Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, resulting in a target service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). Currently, on-hand inventory is 247, with a large pipeline of 1045 units. The next three expected arrivals (from P3, P4, P5) sum to 716 units. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 1292 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of average demand (1292 / 251 \u2248 5.1). Since the base stock objective for (L+1) = 5 periods is roughly 1255 units (5 * 251), we are well-positioned. Using 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat will leverage the full historical average and the confirmed 4-period lead time to maintain a stable replenishment signal.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $613.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (P1-P7) averages approximately 261 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 66. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Currently, we have 399 units on-hand and 741 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The next expected arrival is the P4 order (224 units) in P8, followed by P5 (87 units) in P9. Given the Women's Lingerie category and the cotton-lace utility product, demand is relatively stable but shows some variance. I will use the last 7 samples (the available game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the recent trend more accurately than the pre-game history. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a pack of thong briefs, a stable lingerie staple with relatively consistent demand. Historical demand over the last 8 periods is: 159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253, 283. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 264. Average demand since the lead-time resolved (Period 5-8) is slightly lower at 250.5 units per period. The lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on the last 4 arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8). There is currently 340 units on hand and 811 units in transit (ordered in P5: 87, P6: 329, P7: 101, P8: 294). The pipeline covers expected demand for the next 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent history since the start, which stabilizes the estimate against the high volatility seen in P2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to provide a conservative buffer for the high variance observed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie), which typically exhibits stable staple demand but can fluctuate slightly with promotions or spring transitions. Current date is mid-April. Looking at historical demand (including pre-game and the 9 periods), the demand sequence is: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253, 283, 176]. The mean of the game periods (1-9) is ~254 units. Recent demand is slightly lower, but not significantly enough to declare a regime shift away from the stable average. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (matches promised). I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9) to focus on the game-play demand patterns while filtering out the very low pre-game 'warm-up' values.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's cotton thongs. The demand history for the last 10 periods (including pre-game data [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and game history [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253, 283, 176, 169]) shows a mean of approximately 243. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 283, 176, 169) suggests a slight downward trend or stabilization at a lower level compared to the initial peak (P2-P4). The lead time is confirmed consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 411 and 815 units in transit, the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for demand and standard calculation for lead time to capture the recent stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock for this staple product category. L=4, so mu_hat will be based on (1+L)=5 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a stable staple in womens lingerie. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized around 171 units/week, down from the earlier average of ~250 units/week. Since the current inventory position (On-hand: 336 + In-transit: 844 = 1180) is quite high relative to the current demand rate (~7 weeks of supply at current rates), I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this lower demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5-P11), matching the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from ~250 to ~172 (-31%) and has remained stable for 3 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong) is currently in Period 13. Analysis of historical data and carry-over insights confirms a consistent lead time of 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 9, where average demand dropped from ~250 units to ~172 units. However, Period 12 showed a sudden spike to 323 units, which may be a temporary fluctuation or an early indicator of a new shift (possibly related to late April/early May seasonality). Given the carry-over insight noted the drop to ~172 was stable for three periods prior, I will use a balanced approach. I am selecting N=4 for mu_hat (covering Periods 9-12) to capture the recent lower regime while accounting for the recent spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last period. This strategy aims to prevent stockouts if the Period 12 spike continues while acknowledging the lower baseline observed since April.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime shift identified in Period 12 continues. Demand from Period 9 to 13 averaged 193.2 units, which is a significant drop from the pre-Period 9 average of ~250. Period 12 saw a brief spike (323), but Period 13 returned to a lower level (122). Given the date (mid-May) and the product type (Women's cotton thongs), there is no immediate seasonal driver for a massive surge. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 473 and a significant pipeline of 596 units, the stock position is healthy relative to the lower demand. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the new demand mean (approx 193) and its associated volatility. This N balances the recent trend with enough data to estimate sigma effectively.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Underwear) is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the start of the year. Since Period 9, the demand mean has stabilized around ~183 (samples: 176, 169, 176, 323, 122, 151). The peak in Period 12 (323) appears to be an outlier or a short-lived spike, as demand reverted to 122 and 151 in subsequent weeks. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With 454 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 504 units, the total inventory position is 958. Given the current average demand of ~183, this inventory covers over 5 periods, which is sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=6 covers back to Period 9, which aligns with the previously identified regime shift while incorporating recent variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P16 (2019/5/27). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on history (P11 order arrived in P15). Demand shifted around P9; pre-P9 mean was ~250, while post-P9 (P9-P15) mean is 184. Over the last 4 periods (P12-P15), mean demand is 191.75. However, P12 saw a spike to 323, while subsequent periods (P13-P15) averaged 148. Given the product is women's underwear (staple item), the P12 spike likely relates to holiday/payday cycles rather than a permanent shift. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the post-shift regime from P9 onwards) to capture the lower demand floor while reflecting recent variance. On-hand (413) and In-transit (479) total 892. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods (L+review). At a mean of ~184, safety stock for a 0.8 service level (4/(4+1)) is required. The current pipeline is sufficient, but recent_N ensures the backend adjusts the base stock to the new lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Post-P9 demand mean confirmed at ~184 (vs ~250 previously) over a 7-period window.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The product is women's thong underwear. Historical data shows a demand regime shift around Period 9, where mean demand dropped from ~250 to ~184. Over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has been [122, 151, 171, 200], showing a slight gradual increase but still well below the initial high-demand phase. The Lead Time is confirmed as 4 periods consistently. In Period 16, the expected arrival (ordered in Period 12) was 0 because the order placed in Period 12 was 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' message. The pipeline inventory is high (628 units), which, combined with 213 units on-hand, is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ periods of current demand levels (~841 total units / ~184 avg = 4.5 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' as it is stable at 4. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand characteristics (P9-P16) while acknowledging the recent slight upward trend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18 (June 10). The product is a basic lingerie item (thong briefs). We have observed a demand regime shift starting around Period 9. The average demand for the most recent 9 periods (P9-P17) is approximately 182.7, confirming the previous insight (around 184). The demand in P12 was an outlier (323), but subsequent demands have remained stable between 122 and 200. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P13 order in P17. However, the order from Period 12 (0 units) means no arrival is expected in Period 16, which matches history. The order from Period 14 (40 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 18 and be visible in the next period's report. With on-hand inventory at 393 and in-transit at 496, the pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime since Period 9 while excluding the higher initial demand. Standard L=4 is maintained.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 19 (mid-June). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 9, with mean demand decreasing from ~270 (P1-P8) to ~185 (P9-P18). Although Period 12 and 18 saw spikes (>280), the overall average since Period 9 is 184.2 units/period. The order from Period 12 (0 units) arrived as expected in Period 16 (indicated by 'arrived=0'). In-transit inventory (587) consists of orders from Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18. With On-hand inventory at 152 and a forecasted weekly demand of ~195 (incorporating recent slight upticks), the total pipeline covers the lead time plus current period (5 periods x 195 = 975 units). Current inventory position (152 + 587 = 739) is slightly low. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime while accounting for recent variability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with a massive demand spike of 556 units in Period 19, likely driven by seasonal summer demand for cotton underwear/lingerie as we enter late June. A shipment from Period 12 (0 units ordered) was 'skipped' in arrivals as expected. However, Period 16's order of 149 units is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 20 logic, visible in Period 21) or possibly lost, though lead time has been a consistent 4 periods. The current in-transit (777 units) includes orders from P16 (149), P17 (202), P18 (131), and P19 (295). Given the demand jump from an average of ~184 to 556, I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this upward momentum and setting sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the volatility seen in the last period. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed 4-period baseline while monitoring for the missing P16 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 19 (556 units), marking a potential seasonal regime shift for the summer period. Demand mean increased from ~184 to a trailing 3-period average of ~330.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Womens Lingerie' (Specifically cotton thongs). We entered July (Period 21), following a massive demand spike in the second half of June (P19=556, P20=261). Historical demand jumped from an average of ~184 to ~330 recently. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite 149 units arriving last period, due to high demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P17, P18, P19, and P20). We have 1011 units in-transit (ordered P17, P18, P19, P20). The high demand in June/July likely reflects summer seasonality for this specific product category. I am setting L to 4 (promised/actual), mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods average is ~332.6, so (1+4)*333 = 1665), and sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in P19. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this specific 'summer' surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: Period 19-20 demand average is 408 units, significantly higher than the previous 184 average (+121%).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie thong. We are currently in early July (Period 22), entering the heart of the summer season. We observed a massive demand spike in Period 19 (556 units), followed by a return to more moderate but still elevated levels (261 and 201 units). Total demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) averaged 339 units, compared to the spring average of ~184. On-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit). Although there are 1447 units in transit, the immediate coverage is tight. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this higher summer regime (average ~339), which results in a base stock level calculation covering (1+4) periods of this higher demand. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 3 periods to account for the high volatility seen during the start of the summer spike. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal regime (July) average demand confirmed at ~339 units/period based on P19-P21 data, significantly higher than the spring baseline of 184.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a significant stock-out due to a summer demand surge (July). Demand in the last four periods (P19-P22) has had values of 556, 261, 201, and 341, averaging approximately 340 units per period. This is significantly higher than the previous spring baseline of 184 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the system covers L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 4-period demand average (~340), \u03bc\u0302 should be set to 1700 (5 * 340) to aggressive recapture lost sales and meet the seasonal peak. Sigma_hat is set to the recent variation to ensure an appropriate safety stock buffer, accounting for the spike seen in P19. The OR backend will order against this target minus the 1923 units in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1180.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a high-demand summer seasonal regime. Period 23 demand (422) confirms the sustained higher demand mean observed since Period 19. The recent 5-period average (P19-P23) is approximately 356 units. However, there's a stockout risk as we are currently ending with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the backend capped policy subtracts the 'pipeline_inventory' (1696) from the calculated base_stock, and 1696 currently covers exactly 4.7 periods of demand at the 356 rate, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime using N=5 (covering the spike period to now). This ensures the base_stock target is high enough to trigger replenishment before we experience further lost sales, while accounting for the significant volume already in transit (ordered P20-P23).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal regime confirmed: P19-P23 demand average is 356 units, compared to the spring baseline of 184.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's lace thong) is currently in a summer seasonal regime. Historical data shows a significant demand shift starting around Period 19 (late June). While Period 24 saw a drop to 135 units, the overall average for the P19-P24 summer window is approximately 319 units per period (556, 261, 201, 341, 422, 135). This is significantly higher than the previous spring baseline of ~184. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Inventory is currently recovering from stockouts, with 248 units on hand and 1,661 units in transit. Given the summer seasonality, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current summer demand mean (approx 319) and variance, ensuring the mu_hat reflects the (1+L) requirement for the 5-period risk horizon (L=4 + 1 review period).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal regime (late June to late July) average demand is ~319 units/period (P19-P24), showing higher volatility than spring.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie Thong) demonstrated a significant demand surge between Periods 19 and 23 (Average ~356), matching a summer seasonal peak. However, the last two periods (P24 and P25) have seen demand drop significantly to 135 and 133 respectively. This suggests the peak 'summer regime' may be concluding as we enter August. Total Pipeline Inventory is very high (On-hand: 753, In-transit: 1023), totaling 1776 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods (L=4), we look at 5 periods of demand. Even at the peak average (356), 5 periods would require ~1780 units. With demand appearing to mean-revert towards the pre-summer baseline (~184) or at least cooling off, our current position is heavily overstocked relative to the most recent data (P24-P25 average ~134). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture both the peak and the start of the decline, allowing the OR backend to restrict ordering while we bleed off the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak appears to have ended in Period 24; demand dropped from ~356 average (P19-P23) to ~134 (P24-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Thong Underwear) has exited its mid-summer seasonal peak. Demand reached a high of 556 in Period 19 and averaged ~360 units during the peak, but has since dropped significantly. The last three periods (P24-P26) show demand of 135, 133, and 339 respectively. While P26 showed a bounce back to 339, the overall trend suggests a transition back toward the spring baseline of ~184 or a slightly higher late-summer mean. Currently, there is a very high on-hand inventory of 1,021 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P21 and P22), plus 416 units still in transit. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, the target service level is 80%. With over 1,400 units available in the system and recent average demand trending much lower than the seasonal peak, the current inventory level is sufficient for several periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-peak cooling while acknowledging the recent P26 spike, and keep L at the default promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak transition: Demand is volatile but trending lower than the July peak (P24-P26 average: 202). On-hand inventory is currently significantly exceeding expected short-term demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-inventory state following a significant summer demand peak that has now subsided. Demand for the last four periods (P24-P27) has been 135, 133, 339, and 243, averaging approximately 213 units. This is significantly lower than the July average of ~330. With 846 units currently on hand and 348 units in transit (ordered in P24, expected to arrive in P28), the total pipeline of 1,194 units is sufficient to cover approximately 5-6 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, the OR engine will naturally minimize orders to reduce this excess inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect this post-peak demand regime and ensure the system does not over-order based on the prior summer spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand regime (P24-P27) confirmed at an average of 213 units/period, down from the ~350 summer peak. Current inventory levels (OH + Transit) are sufficient for >5 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The summer peak has clearly ended, with recent demand (P24-P28) averaging approximately 190 units/period, down from the peak of 350. Current on-hand inventory is 1094 units, which at the current burn rate covers more than 5 periods of demand. With 55 units in transit and a lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory is 1149 units against a 5-period requirement (L+1) of roughly 950 units. We are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat to reflect the post-peak regime (N=5) to allow the OR backend to scale down orders while monitoring for a new baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand regime (P24-P28) confirmed at an average of ~190 units/period. The system is currently overstocked with ~5.7 periods of supply on-hand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The summer seasonal peak (July/August) has clearly ended. Demand in the last two periods (P28-P29) has dropped to 100 and 124 units, respectively. The average demand since the peak subsided (P24-P29) is approximately 179 units/period, which aligns closely with the pre-summer 'spring' baseline of ~184. Current on-hand inventory is 970 units, which is extremely high (covering over 5 periods of demand at the current rate). With 55 units in transit, the pipeline is saturated. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this post-peak stabilization (P24-P29) while preventing the backend from over-ordering. The OR backend's inventory cap (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) will naturally prevent further orders given the current massive stock surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand stabilization confirmed: Period 24-29 average is ~179 units/period, returning to spring baseline levels (~184).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a post-summer baseline of approximately 179 units/period (P24-P30), which is consistent with the spring baseline of ~184. Current on-hand inventory is 869 units, and 100 units (ordered P28 and P30) are in-transit. Based on the current average demand of 179/period, the on-hand inventory alone covers approximately 4.8 periods, exceeding the required safety level for the 4-period lead time. No immediate replacement is needed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the stabilized post-summer demand regime (P24-P30) and allow the OR backend to gradually adjust without triggering excessive orders while the current surplus is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 has significantly cooled following the summer peak (P19-P23), which saw averages around 350 units. The trailing 8 periods (P24-P31) show a much lower average of approximately 156 units/period, with the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) averaging only 100 units. Currently, the system is heavily overstocked with 792 units on-hand and 140 units in-transit (ordered in P28, P30, P31), against a demand forecast that has regressed to or below the spring baseline. With 792 units on-hand and a current demand trend near 100-150, we have over 5 periods of cover. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the post-peak stabilization (~156/period) while allowing the OR backend to draw down the excess inventory. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand stabilization (P24-P31) confirmed at an average of ~156 units/period, showing a clear return to or below the pre-summer baseline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) has stabilized into a post-summer low-demand regime. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P24-P32), the average demand is 160.7 units/period. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) show a similar average of 124 units. Currently, the on-hand inventory (653) and in-transit units (103) total 756 units. With an expected demand of ~160 units/period and a lead time of 4, the required base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 800 units. Since our current total inventory (756) is close to this requirement and the holding cost ($1.0) is significant relative to profit ($4.0), a conservative approach is maintained to bleed off the excess stock from the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full post-summer stabilization while smoothing out recent fluctuations like the P32 spike (194).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2612.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, a massive demand spike of 692 units occurred (Date: 2019/9/23), which completely depleted the on-hand inventory of 653 units, resulting in stockouts. This spike is significantly higher than the previous 'post-summer' average of ~156 and even exceeds the peak summer demand of 556. This likely represents a new seasonal event or a late-September promotional spike. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 309 units in transit (ordered in P30, P31, P32, and P33). Given the critical stockout and the unpredictability of this new spike, I'm shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the huge P33 demand, while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this higher-demand regime to rebuild inventory quickly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New significant demand spike observed in Period 33 (692 units), surpassing summer peaks and causing a total stockout. Average demand (P29-P33) is now ~238 units, compared to the previous stabilization level of ~156.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock on-hand due to a major demand spike in Period 33 (692 units) followed by sustained high demand in Period 34 (335 units). This pattern resembles the summer seasonal spike but shifted to early autumn, suggesting a new seasonal or promotional regime. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 926, which includes orders from P31 (40), P32 (18), P33 (206), and P34 (662). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 280 units. However, given the extreme volatility and the recent spike of 692, a more responsive forecasting method is required to recover service levels while acknowledging that the P33 spike might be an outlier. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this upward shift (approx. 280 units/period) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the significantly increased volatility. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 33: Average demand increased from ~156 to ~280 (+79%) with high volatility (peak of 692 units in P33).

  "rationale": "The SKU is currently in a state of high demand volatility following a massive spike in Period 33 (692 units) and a subsequent elevated demand of 335 units in Period 34. Although P35 demand dropped to 123, the system has completely stocked out for three consecutive periods (P33-P35) because on-hand inventory was insufficient to meet the sudden surge. The current date (Oct 14) is approaching the late Autumn/Pre-Holiday season, which may explain the erratic but generally higher demand profile compared to the September lull. On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive pipeline of 1580 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the high-demand volatility regime (average ~383 units) rather than the long-term historical mean or the lower summer-end baseline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the significant volatility observed between P31 and P35 ($std \approx 245$). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The large pipeline should begin arriving in P36 (from P32 order) and P37 (from P33 order), though P32 and P33 orders were small (18 and 206 units). The bulk of the relief comes from orders placed in P34 (662) and P35 (694), arriving in P38 and P39 respectively.",
