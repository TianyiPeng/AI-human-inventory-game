Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting Period 1 for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand shows a clear downward trend in the most recent samples ([307, 189, 122]), suggesting a post-peak regime. Given the current date (Feb 11, 2019) and the product type, the recent high demand likely correlated with the lead-up to Valentine's Day. To avoid overstocking during the subsequent demand drop, I am using a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent mean and volatility shifts. Lead time (L) is set to default (2) as no deliveries have been observed yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs. Current demand history: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] (pre-game) and Period 1 demand was 159. The mean demand across all 6 samples is 223.6. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The order placed in P1 (361 units) is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P3 (L=2). On-hand is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in P1. To prevent further stockouts and cover the review period plus lead time (1+L=3 periods), I will use the mean of the available history. Since the recent demands (189, 122, 159) suggest a downward shift compared to earlier peaks (267-307), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to avoid over-ordering as the regime stabilizes lower, while keeping L at default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Product 464297007 (Women's Thong 3-pack) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and 519 units in-transit (361 units from P1, 158 units from P2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the timing logic, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and become visible in the P3 conclude message (ready for P4). Historical demand [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] plus recent observations (P1: 159, P2: 373) show significant volatility. Demand in P2 was quite high (373). Given the lead time L=2, we need to cover demand for periods 3, 4, and 5 (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level, setting N=5 to balance the high P2 demand with the lower P1 demand. L is set to default as we haven't confirmed any lead-time drift yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/4. The product is a pack of thong briefs, a basic underwear item with generally stable demand, though the early historical data provided ([267, 298, 307, 189, 122]) and recent game history ([159, 373, 301]) show significant volatility. The mean of the last 3 periods is ~278. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 order arrived in 2 periods (as promised), but Period 2 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests the supply chain is responsive. Currently, we have 218 on-hand and 326 in-transit (ordered P3). Since L=2, the P3 order is expected to arrive in Period 5. For Period 4, we must cover demand for Period 4, 5, and 6 (L+1). Given the demand volatility, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime and use the 'default' lead time of 2. This ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock to handle the high variance observed while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a basic lingerie staple with relatively stable demand, though the last 5 periods show some volatility (range 122-373). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 4 demand (278) exceeded the starting inventory (218). We have 774 units in-transit: 326 units ordered in P3 (promised L=2, expected arrival P5) and 448 units ordered in P4 (promised L=2, expected arrival P6). Historical lead times observed are 2 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P2 order). Since we are currently at 0 stock, the priority is to maintain a service level that prevents stockouts while acknowledging the recent demand mean. The mean of the last 5 samples provided in history [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] is ~236, but the 'Game History' demand for the first 4 periods [159, 373, 301, 278] averages ~278. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of the specific game session. For L, I will use 'calculate' to leverage the backend's ability to average the observed lead times (1 and 2 periods).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is cotton thong underwear, which generally has stable demand. Looking at historical data (pre-game: 267, 298, 307, 189, 122; game: 159, 373, 301, 278, 250), the mean demand is approximately 254 units. The inventory currently has 76 units on-hand and 637 in-transit (orders from P4 and P5). Since P4 order (448 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2, it is expected to arrive during P6 and be visible in P7's start. Lead times have been 2 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P2 order), and 2 periods (P3 order), confirming the promised lead time of 2 is reliable. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current game-environment consumption (mean ~272) while using all data for volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock. L is set to default as the lead time of 2 is stable.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 3-pack of cotton thongs. Recent demand (last 6 periods) has been [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216]. While initial demand peaked around Period 2, it has stabilized at a lower level recently. The average of the last 4 periods is 261.25. Lead times have been observed as 2, 1, 2, and 2 periods (average 1.75), generally matching the promised L=2. There is currently 308 on-hand and 404 in-transit (orders from P5: 189 and P6: 215). Since L=2, the P5 order is expected to arrive during P7. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current demand stabilization (approx. 260 units/period) while ignoring the initial volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand over the (L+1)=3 period window (approx 780 units), ensuring service levels are maintained without excessive holding costs as demand cools from its early peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's lingerie thong (cotton jersey). Past demand shows stability with a mean of 261.25 across the last 8 observations (including pre-history [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and game history [159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216, 253]). The current on-hand inventory is low (55) but 530 units are in transit. Specifically, the order from Period 5 (189 units) is overdue (promised L=2, now at L=3), suggesting a slight logistics delay or loss. However, orders from P3 and P4 arrived with L=2. To handle the uncertainty and the stockout risk from the missing P5 order, I will use a conservative lead time estimate (explicit L=2.5) and a recent-demand window of N=7 to capture the latest consumption patterns. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the pipeline and current demand spike risks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $976.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 8. Historical demand is relatively stable, with the last 8 periods averaging 264 units (all 13 samples average 254). The most recent demand was 283. Lead times have shown volatility: while the promised lead time is 2, observed values are [2, 1, 2, 2, 3]. The most recent arrival (ordered Period 5) took 3 periods. Currently, 713 units are in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). Given the recent L=3 observation, I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for a longer protection interval (L+1=4 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime (approx. 264 units/period) rather than the older, more erratic data points. This approach balances the need for stock recovery with the risk of over-ordering once the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability detected: Period 5 order arrived in Period 8 (actual L=3 vs promised L=2).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the product is a standard lingerie item (thong briefs). Current inventory is 165 units on-hand with 740 in-transit. Historical demand shows a downward trend recently (283 to 176 in the last two periods), but the overall mean over the last 5 periods is approximately 235. The carry-over insight from Period 9 identifies a lead time drift from the promised 2 periods to 3 periods (Period 5 and Period 6 orders both took 3 periods). Using L=3 is safer to account for this instability and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 4 and 8. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent mean of ~235 (Total mu_hat = (1+3)*235 = 940) and use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the observed longer lead time and recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift confirmed: Observed L=3 in two of the last three arrivals (P5 and P6 orders). Recent demand (P9) dropped to 176, significantly below the 10-period average.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a women's thong 3-pack. Recent demand over the last 5 periods has shown a downward shift (253, 283, 176, 169) compared to earlier periods, likely due to post-Easter stabilization. More critically, lead time (L) has drifted. Promised L=2, but observed L for orders from Period 5 and 6 was 3 periods. The Period 8 order (372 units) and Period 9 order (368 units) are currently in-transit; under L=3, the Period 8 order should arrive this period (Period 11). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to recent stockouts. To account for the confirmed lead time drift to 3 periods and the recent demand regime (avg ~220), I will set L to 3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower demand trend while balancing for the longer lead time window (L+1=4 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) covers the longer replenishment cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~280 to ~220 over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10). Lead time remains unstable with a drift towards 3 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a basic lingerie item. Analyzing the historical demand, there is a clear downward shift: the first 5 periods (excluding Period 1 startup) averaged ~280 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 211.4 units. Period 11 demand was 176. I will set N=5 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime. Regarding lead time, the promised L is 2, but the actual lead times for the last three concluded shipments were 3, 2, and 3 periods respectively. This confirms an unstable lead time drifting toward 3. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation covers the extended pipeline and reduces the risk of stockouts observed in P8 and P10. Sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to reflect the current volatility of the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is ~211 units, down from the initial ~280. Lead time remains volatile but leans toward 3 periods (2 of last 3 arrivals had L=3).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status shows 0 on-hand inventory with 625 units in-transit. Demand in Period 12 surged to 323, deviating from the lower average (~211) observed between Periods 7-11. Lead times continue to be highly volatile; the Period 11 order arrived in just 1 period (Period 12), while the Period 8 order took 3. Given the recent demand spike and the need to buffer against potential lead-time delays (which have frequently been 3 periods recently), I will set L to an explicit value of 3. For demand, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the recent lower regime while still being sensitive to the Period 12 spike. Using L=3 will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock to cover the extended pipeline and protect against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand volatility increased (P12 demand 323 vs P11 demand 176). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P11 order arrived in 1 period, P8 took 3).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs. History shows demand is highly volatile, dropping to 122 in P13 from a spike of 323 in P12. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a demand of 122 in the previous period, meaning we are currently stocking out. The In-transit pipeline is significant (970 units), which includes orders from P9 (368 units), P10 (107 units), P12 (150 units), and P13 (345 units). Lead times are unstable: P11 arrived in 1 period, while P8 took 3. Given that the P9 order (368 units) is now at Period 14 and was placed in Period 9, it is currently at L=5 and potentially lost or severely delayed. Similarly, P10 is at L=4. However, the OR backend logic is capped by (1+L), and using a very high L would inflate the base stock unnecessarily if the late orders arrive simultaneously. I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect the recent drift from the promised L=2, while keeping the OR engine's pipeline calculations somewhat grounded. For mu_hat, the recent demand shows a regime change; the average of the last 5 periods [176, 169, 176, 323, 122] is 193.2. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this lower, albeit volatile, mean demand to avoid over-ordering given the large existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time extreme instability: P9 and P10 orders are now overdue (L=5 and L=4 respectively), while P11 arrived in L=1. Demand remains highly volatile with a 5-period average of 193.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we are dealing with a critical inventory shortage (0 on-hand) and significant lead-time instability. Shipments from Period 9 (368 units) and Period 10 (107 units) are severely overdue (L=6 and L=5 respectively), while the Period 13 order (345 units) is also in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have ranged from 1 to 3, and now include potentially lost or severely delayed shipments. Historically, the last 5 demand periods (P10-P14) averaged 188.2 units, though volatility is high (P12 was 323). Given that 820 units are in-transit (P9, P10, P13), but none have arrived in the last period despite a stockout, I must adjust L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the drift and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the lower recent average (~190). The OR backend's capping mechanism will prevent over-ordering while these 'phantom' in-transit units persist, but setting L=3 increases the base stock target to ensure we eventually recover from the stockout once supply stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Severely delayed/lost shipments: Period 9 (ordered P9) and Period 10 (ordered P10) orders have not arrived as of P15 (L=6 and L=5 respectively). Average demand remains stabilized around 190 units (last 5 periods).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 885 units in-transit, but 475 of these (from Periods 9 and 10) are severely overdue (L=7 and L=6 respectively) and are likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (885) from the base stock to determine the order quantity, it will significantly under-order unless the parameters are adjusted. To compensate for these 'ghost' units in-transit and ensure the service level is maintained despite stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Recent demand (P11-P15) averages ~188 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (L+1 = 3 periods of coverage), the base requirement would be ~564 units. However, to offset the 475 lost units that the OR backend still counts as available, I am setting mu_hat to 1050 (roughly 564 + 480). This 'bridges the gap' created by the backend's lack of awareness regarding lost shipments. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current volatility (range 122-323) without being skewed by the much higher demand levels seen in the first 8 periods.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P9 (368 units) and P10 (107 units) are now confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (L>6). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~190 units/period over the last 5 periods (P11-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 190-200 units (mean of last 5 periods = 193.4). However, the supply chain is highly unstable. Orders from Period 9 (368 units) and Period 10 (107 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The order from Period 13 (345 units) is now overdue (L=4). The OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 1164 includes the 475 units from P9 and P10 that will never arrive. To prevent stockouts, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these ghost units in the pipeline calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline). I will use L=3 as the effective lead time given recent trends. Target Base Stock for (L+1=4) periods at ~195 units/period is ~780. To offset the 475 lost units, the OR backend needs a base_stock near 1255. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1250 and use a higher sigma_hat to account for the extreme lead-time volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Lead time for P13 order has reached L=4 without arrival, confirming continued supply instability. Ghost inventory from P9/P10 (475 units) continues to inflate pipeline visibility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We are experiencing severe supply chain issues. Orders from Period 9 (368 units), Period 10 (107 units), Period 13 (345 units), and Period 14 (0 units) are either lost or heavily delayed (L > 4). These 'ghost' units in the pipeline prevent the OR backend from ordering enough to meet demand because the cap mechanism considers them part of the supply. Total in-transit is 1396, but at least 820 of these (P9, P10, P13) are unreliable. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 190 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). To force the backend to place an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to better reflect the current average delay and help the OR engine expand the pipeline buffer. mu_hat is set to cover 5 periods (L+1) at the current regime mean of 190. sigma_hat is set to 200 to ensure a higher service level given the low reliability of arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from P13 (345 units) are now overdue (L=5), following the loss of P9 and P10. Demand regime remains stable at ~190 units/period (last 5 periods avg).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19 (2019/6/17). The demand regime has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 191 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18). However, the supply chain is highly unstable. Orders from P9 (368 units), P10 (107 units), and P13 (345 units) are confirmed lost or severely delayed (L=6+), yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count of 1099. Only the P16 order (279 units) is likely to arrive. This 'ghost inventory' (820 units) causes the OR backend to under-order significantly. To counteract this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3): 191 * 3 = 573. To force an order despite the 1099 pipeline, mu_hat must be set high enough so that base_stock - 1099 > 0. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1500 to trigger a recovery order and offset the missing units. L is set to 3 to reflect the actual average lead time including delays.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure exacerbated: P13 order (345 units) now confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (L=6). Total ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) reached 820 units. Demand is currently in a regime of ~191 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/6/24), we are observing a significant demand spike (P19 demand was 556, more than double the recent average). This is likely driven by seasonal summer demand for the product (Greta Thong). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Orders from P9 (368 units), P10 (107 units), and P13 (345 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they are now at L=11, L=10, and L=7 respectively. These 820 units of 'ghost inventory' are inflating the in-transit figure (1284 units), which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes supply is coming. To compensate for this 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 5. By increasing L, I artificially inflate the target base stock, forcing the backend to ignore the fake pipeline and place a larger order to meet the current demand surge. The demand mu_hat is set to 230 to balance the recent regime (~190) with the massive spike observed in P19 (556), and sigma_hat is increased to 150 to reflect high volatility and protect against further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected: P19 demand (556) is ~2.9x the recent 5-period average (191), likely seasonal summer peak. Total lost inventory (ghost pipeline) confirmed at 820 units (P9, P10, P13).

In Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are facing a critical inventory shortage. Recent demand spiked significantly in P19 (556) and P20 (261), likely due to a summer seasonality peak for this thong brief product. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (including the spike) is 250.4 units. We are also dealing with severe supply chain failure: orders from P9, P10, and P13 (totaling 820 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. These 'ghost units' are inflating the backend's 'In-transit' view (1284 total, but 820 are non-existent), which would normally cause the OR backend to stop ordering. To force an order and bridge this gap, I am setting L to 5 (explicitly reflecting the current delay/loss risk) and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for both the seasonal demand level (~250-300 units/period) and the need to offset the 820 units of ghost pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 1800 (equivalent to ~300 per period for L+1=6) will trigger a substantial order to refill the empty on-hand stock and overcome the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: P19 and P20 demand averaged 408 units (2x previous regime). Total lost 'ghost' inventory persists at 820 units (P9, P10, P13), requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/8. Demand in Period 19 (556) and Period 20 (261) indicates a significant upward shift compared to the earlier regime of ~190 units, likely driven by summer seasonality for lingerie/thongs. Period 21 demand was 201, following a stockout in Period 20. The 3-period average is now ~339. Lead time remains unstable, with recent arrivals occurring at L=2 and L=3, so L=3 is used for safety. A critical issue is 'ghost inventory': orders from P9 (368), P10 (107), and P13 (345) are lost/indefinitely delayed but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory (820 units). To force the backend to place an order despite this 820-unit phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the high-demand regime (~400 units/period) for (L+1)=4 periods, which is 1600 units, and then I add the 820 lost units to the mu_hat to 'neutralize' their impact on the OR logic (Base Stock - Pipeline). This ensures the backend sees a required stock level that triggers replenishment for actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed: P19-P21 demand demonstrates a shift to a higher regime (avg ~339). Total lost 'ghost' inventory (P9, P10, P13) remains at 820 units, necessitating mu_hat inflation to offset pipeline calculations.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a summer seasonal peak for underwear/thong briefs, with demand in the last 4 periods (P19-P22) averaging 340 units, significantly higher than the previous spring regime (~190). Supply chain instability is severe: 820 units from orders P9 (368), P10 (107), and P13 (345) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed but remain in the 'In-transit' count (pipeline inventory). This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock because it thinks these units are coming. To force the OR backend to place orders, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, to offset 820 ghost units over a 3-period window (L+1), I need to add ~273 to the base forecast. Recent average demand (340) * 3 = 1020. Adding the 820 offset brings the required mu_hat to 1840. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P19, P21) have been 1-2 periods, though instability remains. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (150) to account for high recent volatility (demand range 201-556).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (July 22), demand for the 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' has entered a higher summer regime, with the last 5 periods averaging 356 units. However, the system's pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by 820 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P9, P10, and P13 confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed). Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline from the base stock calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline), it will fail to place necessary orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these 820 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 976 units, but with a recent demand average of ~356, this will be depleted in approximately 2-3 periods. To ensure the backend places orders that cover the summer demand while bypassing the ghost inventory gap, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at ~356 units/period (total 1068) plus safety stock, then add the 820 units of lost inventory. This results in a mu_hat of 1900 to ensure replenishment occurs despite the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime remains strong: 5-period average (P19-P23) is 356 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 820 units (P9, P10, P13).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a summer demand regime where demand has been elevated, though Period 24 saw a significant dip to 135 units. The 5-period average (P20-P24) is approximately 272 units, which is lower than the previous 5-period average (356) but still above the spring baseline of ~190. A critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 820 units from lost orders in P9, P10, and P13. These units are counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation (In-transit: 1128 units), but they will never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain stock, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 820-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Mu = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. With expected demand around 250 and L=2, base mu_hat would be 750. Adding 820 ghost units gives 1570. For sigma_hat, recent volatility (last 5 periods) is used to reflect current demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued inflation of mu_hat required to offset 820 units of 'ghost inventory' (P9, P10, P13) which remains in the system pipeline but is confirmed lost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), the product is in a post-summer seasonal peak. Demand has sharply declined from an average of ~356 (P19-P23) to an average of 134 over the last two periods (P24-P25). The main challenge remains the 820 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P9, P10, and P13) which are confirmed lost but still occupy the backend's 'In-transit' pipeline calculation. Current On-hand is 708 units, and reported In-transit is 1128 units (which includes 820 ghost units + 308 from P24). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly suppressing orders due to this ghost pipeline, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~135 units/period. For a target base stock covering 3 periods (L+1, where L=2), the required inventory is ~405. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (1128) from base_stock, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the calculated base_stock minus 1128 results in a sensible order if needed. However, with 708 units actually on hand and demand at ~135, we have over 5 periods of stock. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime (~135 * 3 = 405) while acknowledging that no new order will be placed this period due to the high on-hand balance and the capping logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-summer demand has dropped significantly to ~134 units/period (P24-P25). Ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) remains at 820 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27 (2019/8/12). Recent demand is volatile: following a sharp drop in P24-P25 (avg 134), P26 rebounded to 339. The 5-period average (P22-P26) is approximately 274 units. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 820 units (from P9, P10, and P13) which are confirmed lost but still reside in the OR backend's pipeline calculation. Total pipeline is 1128, including 308 legitimate units from P24. Current on-hand is 369. Effective inventory position (on-hand + legit in-transit) is 677 units. To ensure the backend doesn't starve the SKU due to the ghost 820 units, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating for a target inventory of roughly 3 periods of coverage (~825 units) + the 820 ghost units = 1645. Setting mu_hat to 1645 via explicit method. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (explicit) to reflect high recent volatility (133 to 339). Lead time L is kept at 2 (default) as recent arrivals (P21, P22) have stabilized near promised levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand volatility: P24-P25 averaged 134 units, while P26 jumped to 339. Ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) persists at 820 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a post-summer transition phase. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) is approximately 212.5 units, which is lower than the summer peak but higher than the mid-regime. A significant challenge remains: 820 units from orders P9, P10, and P13 are confirmed lost ('ghost inventory') but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1487. The OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock. To trigger a replenishment order, I must inflate mu_hat to overcome this 820-unit deficit. Calculation: Target base stock needs to be around (1+L)*demand + safety stock. With L=2, and demand ~213, base stock should be ~640. However, the system sees pipeline=1487. To get an order of ~250 units, I need a mu_hat around (1487 + 250) = 1737. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1750 to ensure the backend generates an order despite the phantom pipeline, while maintaining L at the promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P19, P21, P22) have returned to a faster lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization: Demand for P24-P27 averages 212 units, suggesting a step down from the 350+ summer peak. Ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) remains at 820 units, requiring continued mu_hat inflation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the product (women's thong briefs) is transitioning out of the summer peak. The 5-period demand average (P24-P28) has dropped to approximately 190 units, compared to the summer peak of ~350 units. We continue to manage the 'ghost inventory' issue: orders from P9, P10, and P13 (totaling 820 units) are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To prevent the OR backend from stopping orders due to this inflated pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Total pipeline is 1809 units. Subtracting the 820 units of ghost inventory leaves a real pipeline of 989 units (orders from P24, P27, P28). I set mu_hat explicitly to offset the ghost units. Target base stock = (Forecasted mu * (L+1)) + ghost inventory. Estimated demand is ~190. With L=2, base stock needs to be (190 * 3) + 820 = 1390. I will set mu_hat to 1390 / 3 \u2248 463 to ensure the backend continues to order sufficient stock for current demand levels while ignoring the lost shipments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The primary challenge remains the 820 units of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 9, 10, and 13 (368 + 107 + 345 = 820) which are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline in the OR backend's calculation. To force the backend to place an order despite this 820-unit 'in-transit' figure, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. The current demand regime (post-summer) has stabilized at approximately 151 units per period (average of P24-P29). Using a lead time L=2, the total (L+1) period demand requirement is 453 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover this demand plus compensate for the 820 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1273 (453 + 820). This bypasses the pipeline deduction. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the higher volatility seen in the transition from the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift: Average demand for P24-P29 is ~151 units. Ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) remains at 820 units and must be offset by mu_hat inflation until purged from the system.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 31 (2019/9/9): On-hand inventory is 580 units. In-transit inventory is 1128 units, which includes 820 units of 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost orders in Periods 9, 10, and 13 (368 + 107 + 345 = 820). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the entire pipeline (1128 units) from the calculated base stock. To prevent the OR engine from stopping all orders due to this fake pipeline, I must continue to inflate mu_hat by exactly 820 units plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period. Recent demand (P24-P30) shows a stabilized post-summer regime averaging ~168 units per period (135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124, 101). Using a lead time of 3 (observed recent max) means L+1 = 4. Expected demand for 4 periods is ~672 units. Adding the 820 ghost offset results in a mu_hat of 1492. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to reflect current volatility without over-reacting to the summer spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift: Average demand (P24-P30) is ~168 units/period. Ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) persists at 820 units and must be offset via mu_hat inflation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, we are in a post-summer demand regime. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 31 is approximately 156 units/period, showing a significant drop from the summer peak (~350). The 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in Periods 9, 10, and 13 (totaling 820 units) remains in the system's pipeline but is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. To ensure the OR backend (which uses a base-stock policy: base_stock - pipeline) actually places orders when needed, I must inflate mu_hat. Without inflation, the backend sees 1128 units in-transit (820 ghost + 308 from P24) and will not order until on-hand is nearly depleted. I set mu_hat using 'explicit' to approximately (1+L) * 156 + 820 to offset the ghost units. I use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P27, P28) showed L=3 and L=2 respectively, and the primary goal is pipeline correction. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the post-summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P24-P31) average is ~156 units/period. Ghost inventory (P9, P10, P13) persists at 820 units, requiring mu_hat inflation of ~820 units to maintain stock levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, the system reports 1128 units in-transit. Based on historical data, this is comprised of 820 units confirmed lost from early periods (P9, P10, P13) and a 308-unit order from P24 which is now 9 periods overdue and also likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1128) from the base stock calculation, it will refuse to place new orders even as on-hand stock (309) depletes. The current demand regime (P24-P32) has stabilized at an average of approximately 161 units/period. To force the backend to place an order and maintain service levels, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' pipeline. Target base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~161 * 3 = 483). To achieve this while the backend subtracts 1128, I set mu_hat to approximately 1611 (1128 + 483). I keep L at the promised 2 periods to avoid unnecessary over-ordering beyond the offset requirement.

Carry-over insight: P24 order (308 units) is now 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total 'ghost inventory' to 1128 units. Post-summer demand regime (P24-P32) average is ~161 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1236.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked significantly to 692, which is approximately 4.3x the post-summer average (~161), likely indicating a one-off event or early seasonal shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1425 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', we have confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) from Periods 9 (368), 10 (107), 13 (345), and 24 (308), totaling 1128 units. These units will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory. Additionally, Period 27 (359) and Period 28 (322) orders HAVE arrived, but the OR engine may still be miscalculating the pipeline. The most recent order from Period 33 (297 units) is expected to arrive in Period 35/36. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1128 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1800. This is calculated as: (Desired Stock for next 3 periods: ~200 units/period * 3 = 600) + (Ghost Inventory Offset: 1128) + (Buffer for demand spike: 72) \u2248 1800. I am maintaining L=2 as the base, though actual lead times are unstable.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 33 (692 units) noted; requires monitoring to see if it's a new regime or a one-off. Ghost inventory total confirmed at 1128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system faces critical inventory depletion (on-hand: 0) following two high-demand periods (P33: 692, P34: 335). The 'In-transit' figure of 2071 units is heavily inflated by 1128 units of 'ghost inventory' from orders confirmed lost (P9, P10, P13, P24). Subtracting these lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 943 units (from P33 and P34). Current demand shows a significant upward shift; the average of the last two periods is 513 units, compared to the previous post-summer average of ~160. To maintain availability despite the backend OR engine seeing a massive (but fake) pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. I estimate the 'true' needed base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) using the recent high-demand mean (~500 * 3 = 1500) and add the 1128 ghost units to offset the backend's subtraction, resulting in a target mu_hat of approximately 2628. I set sigma_hat explicitly to 300 to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: P33-P34 average demand is 513 units, a ~200% increase over the P24-P32 average (161). Ghost inventory total confirmed at 1128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), demand has entered a volatile phase following a massive spike in P33 (692 units). The recent 3-period average is 383 units (P33-P35), while the broader post-summer average was significantly lower (~160). This suggests a possible early autumn/winter demand shift or promotional effect. Regarding supply, the 'ghost inventory' (orders confirmed lost but still in the system pipeline) has reached 1128 units (P9: 368, P10: 107, P13: 345, P24: 308). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts this pipeline inventory from the base stock. To ensure the backend actually places orders and doesn't assume we are overstocked, mu_hat must be inflated to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods PLUS the ghost inventory. With L=2, mu_hat should target ((3 * 383) + 1128) \u2248 2277. Using mu_hat 'explicit' allows us to bypass the contaminated pipeline data and maintain a service level consistent with the recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) is 1128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24). Demand regime shifted upwards in P33, with a 3-period average (P33-P35) of 383 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-320.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 is experiencing significant supply chain instability with a total of 1,128 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P24) still residing in the backend's pipeline calculation. In Period 36, the order from P33 finally arrived (L=3), and the on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 720 units. However, recent demand is cooling significantly, with the last two periods averaging only 111.5 units, down from the volatile spike seen in P33-P35. I will set mu_hat to 1,500 using the 'explicit' method. This value is calculated to offset the 1,128 units of ghost inventory while providing coverage for approximately 372 units of real demand over the L+1 window (approx. 124 units per period for 3 periods). This ensures the OR backend doesn't prematurely stop ordering due to the false pipeline signal, while accounting for the recent deceleration in demand. Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks without over-penalizing for the massive P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory remains at 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24). Demand has slowed from the P33-P35 spike, with P35-P36 averaging 111 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows 1,406 units on-hand with a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,128 units (lost orders from P9, P10, P13, P24). Demand has stabilized significantly after the P33 spike, with the last three periods (P35-P37) averaging 116 units/period. Given the high on-hand balance (1,406) relative to this demand, no new orders are required for several periods. The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). With a pipeline of 1,128 and on-hand of 1,406, the effective inventory position is 2,534. To prevent the system from being paralyzed by the 1,128 ghost units once on-hand stocks deplete, mu_hat must eventually be inflated. However, for the current period, the priority is minimizing holding costs. I will set L to default (2), and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent stable regime (N=3) to allow the on-hand surplus to be consumed.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand stabilization: P35-P37 demand averaged 116 units/period. Ghost inventory persists at 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower post-spike regime, with the last 4 periods (P35-P38) averaging 115.5 units/period (123, 100, 124, 115). On-hand inventory is currently high at 1291 units due to arrivals from P34 and P35, covering approximately 11 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1128 units represents 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P9, P10, P13, P24), which the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from its base stock calculation. However, with 1291 units on hand and demand around 115, the current stock levels are more than sufficient to prevent stockouts despite the pipeline error. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current demand stabilization and leave L at default. No new orders are needed; the high on-hand inventory will naturally deplete toward the target level.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime confirmed (P35-P38): Average demand is 115.5 units/period. Ghost inventory persists at 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. Demand in P39 was 241, which is higher than the previous 4-period average (P35-P38) of ~115, but lower than the P33-P34 spike. The 5-period average (P35-P39) is now 140.6 units. Ghost inventory remains a significant issue: Orders from P9 (368), P10 (107), P13 (345), and P24 (308) are all confirmed lost (L > 8 periods), totaling 1128 units currently in the 'In-transit' bucket. This ghost inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering necessary stock because it incorrectly believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock (approx 3 periods of demand at ~141 units/period = 423 units) and then add the 1128 ghost units to 'trick' the backend into a base stock that covers the 1128 phantom units plus actual stock needs. Target base stock = 423 + 1128 = 1551. On-hand is currently 1050. Pipeline is 1128. Since (Base Stock 1551 - Pipeline 1128) = 423, which is greater than 0 but less than on-hand, the capped policy will likely order 0 this period, which is appropriate given the 1050 on-hand units. However, we must keep mu_hat high to ensure that as on-hand drops, the backend doesn't wait too long to order.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory total remains at 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24). Demand regime (P35-P39) is currently averaging 141 units/period following the P33-P34 spike.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 41 (2019/11/18). Demand analysis: The most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average demand of 193.4 units, with a noticeable upward trend in the last two periods (241 and 387), potentially signaling the start of a pre-holiday or Black Friday demand spike. Pipeline analysis: There is 1,128 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P24) which the OR backend treats as live in-transit stock. Current on-hand inventory is 663 units. Without adjustment, the OR engine would see 1,791 units 'available' (663 + 1128), which far exceeds the current demand regime, leading it to order 0. To ensure the backend places an order to cover upcoming demand, mu_hat must be inflated by the amount of ghost inventory. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2, Forecast=200, and Ghost=1128, the value is (3 * 200) + 1128 = 1728. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24) continues to reside in the pipeline. Recent demand (P39-P40) suggests an upward trend (avg 314) vs the previous regime (avg 116).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1077.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. We are entering the late November/December period (Black Friday and holiday season), which explains the recent upward demand trend (P39-P41 average is ~325 units). On-hand inventory is 315 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,243 units is heavily compromised by 1,128 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P24). The real pipeline inventory is only 115 units (ordered in P41). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,128 ghost units as available supply and thus suppressing new orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to the sum of the expected demand for the (L+1) period (~325 * 3 = 975) plus the total ghost inventory (1,128), totaling 2,103. This 'tricks' the backend logic [base_stock - pipeline] into ordering for the actual demand regime. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (N=3) to account for the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov): Demand has increased to ~325 units/period (P39-P41). Ghost inventory persists at 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are entering the peak holiday season. Demand has significantly increased, with the last three periods (P40-P42) averaging 348 units, compared to the previous regime of ~140. However, a massive supply chain issue persists: 1,128 units (from orders in P9, P10, P13, and P24) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed but remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline. The OR backend subtracts this 'ghost inventory' from the target base stock, preventing new orders. To force the system to order despite this 1,128-unit pipeline inflation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on current demand (avg ~348) and a lead time of 2 (Base Stock \u2248 (2+1)*348 + Safety Stock). Adding the 1,128 ghost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of approximately 2,250. This ensures the backend places an order to cover real demand while accounting for the 'dead' pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the holiday spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov/early Dec) confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~348 units/period (P40-P42). Ghost inventory remains at 1,128 units, requiring mu_hat inflation of ~1,128 units to bypass backend logic.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand is in a high-intensity holiday regime, with a 4-period average (P40-P43) of 328 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 2287 units, but 1128 of these are 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P9, P10, P13, and P24). The 'active' pipeline consists of orders from P42 (656 units) and P43 (503 units), totaling 1159 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1128 units of ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods) AND the ghost inventory (3 * 328 + 1128 \u2248 2112). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current holiday volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45), deep in the holiday season. Recent demand (P40-P44) has averaged ~338 units/period, confirming a high-demand holiday regime for lingerie/underwear. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'ghost inventory' (orders P9, P10, P13, and P24) remains at 1,128 units, which are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline in the backend logic. Additionally, orders from P42 (656 units) and P43 (503 units) are currently within the standard lead time window (L=2 to 3) and are expected to arrive in Periods 45 or 46. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 1,128-unit pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, targeting a base stock that covers the holiday demand (~338) plus the ghost inventory offset (1,128). Specifically, (L+1)*338 + 1128 \u2248 2142. I will set mu_hat to 2200 to ensure we maintain safety stock through the end of the year (Period 47). L is set to 'calculate' to account for the actual delivery variability observed in recent successful arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is the Christmas/New Year holiday period (Dec 23). Demand has been high, averaging ~328 units over the last 6 periods (P40-P45), consistent with holiday seasonality for lingerie. We are currently facing significant 'ghost inventory' (1,128 units from P9, P10, P13, P24) which the OR backend incorrectly views as incoming stock. To ensure the backend places orders despite this 1,128-unit pipeline inflation, I must inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Actual demand forecast (1+L)*\u03bc is approximately (1+2)*330 = 990. To offset the 1,128 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 990 + 1128 = 2118. I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the high holiday volatility (std dev approx 47.7). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time which has drifted closer to 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Holiday demand regime (Dec) confirmed at ~330 units/period (P40-P45 avg). Ghost inventory persists at 1,128 units (P9, P10, P13, P24), requiring mu_hat inflation of ~1,128 units to force ordering by the backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 30, 2019. We are at the end of the December holiday season. Demand over the last 7 periods (P40-P46) has been consistently high, averaging ~344 units per period, which aligns with the holiday lingerie demand regime identified in Carry-over Insights. Inventory management is currently complicated by a total of 1,128 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P9, P10, P13, and P24) which have never arrived and are confirmed lost. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' quantity from its base stock calculation. To force an order despite this 1,128-unit inflation, I must set mu_hat (the (L+1) period demand forecast) to a value that exceeds the sum of on-hand inventory and the 1,128 units of ghost pipeline. With on-hand at 0 and a target base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + review period) at ~344 units/period, the true target is ~1,032. To bypass the 1,128-unit ghost inventory and the 259-unit P46 order, I will set mu_hat to 2,500 using the 'explicit' method. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of actual observed lead times (varying between 1-3).
