Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie / Thong). The historical demand [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] shows a mean of 236.6 and a standard deviation of 76.9. There is a visible downward trend in the last two periods (189, 122), suggesting a possible post-peak or seasonal decline. However, with only 5 historical data points and no established regime, I will start with a balanced approach. Promised lead time (L) is 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full recent history while being slightly more responsive to the recent drop than a global 'default' might be if the history were longer. Since on-hand is 0 and there are no units in-transit, the OR engine will place an initial stock-up order to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (staple lingerie). Past demand data shows [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] and the first period of the game saw a demand of 159. The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 367 units in transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect arrivals until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). The demand seems to be in a downward trend or stabilizing at a lower level compared to the very early history. Given only 1 period of game data and 5 periods of prior data, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the more recent demand levels (189, 122, 159) while smoothing out the earlier peaks. Lead time is set to default as we have no evidence yet of deviations from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie). Current Period is 3. We are currently experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory because the promised lead time is 4 periods, and we are only in Period 3. Historically, demand over the last 5 samples was [267, 298, 307, 189, 122], but recent demand in Period 1 (159) and Period 2 (373) shows high volatility. The average demand across these 7 data points is approximately 245. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. mu_hat should reflect this: 5 * 245 = 1225. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior more heavily, while staying within the backend's calculation constraints. For sigma, I'll use 'default' to capture the overall volatility of the dataset. No lead time data is available yet to contradict the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thong briefs, a stable 'Womens Lingerie' staple. Current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1060 units in-transit. Historic demand (pre-game: [267, 298, 307, 189, 122]) and in-game demand (159, 373, 301) suggest a mean demand of approximately 252 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6 'conclude'). Since we are at P4, no arrivals have occurred yet, confirming it is too early to detect lead-time drift or lost shipments. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering 3 in-game and 2 pre-game samples) to capture the most recent demand level, which appears slightly higher than the long-term average. The parameters are set to maintain a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs (Womens Lingerie). Current Period is 5 (March 11, 2019). Historical demand from the prompt (267, 298, 307, 189, 122) combined with game history demand (159, 373, 301, 278) shows a mean of approximately 255. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not arrived yet, which is expected as L=4 means the P1 order arrives in Period 1+4=5 (this period) and will only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 1342 units in-transit (P1: 367, P2: 326, P3: 367, P4: 282). This in-transit quantity aligns with the four orders placed during the lead time. Given the high demand and zero stock, we need to maintain a consistent base stock. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (approx 280) compared to the long-term history, and use the default lead time (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $883.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is Women's Lingerie (Thong briefs). The historical demand over the last 5 periods [159, 373, 301, 278, 250] plus the pre-history [267, 298, 307, 189, 122] suggests a mean demand of approximately 254 units per period. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 are currently in-transit (total 1062 units). Current on-hand inventory is 117. With a lead time of 4, our 'pipeline' needs to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the current demand stability without clear seasonal spikes in mid-March for this category, I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the slightly higher demand observed in the formal game history (avg ~272 in P1-P5) compared to the older pre-history. L will remain at the promised default of 4.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie item (Gretta Thong). Historical demand across 11 samples (including pre-game) is approximately 228 units/period, with a notable drop in the last three periods (mean ~248) compared to periods 2-4 (mean ~317). The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6). Current on-hand is 227, and there are 1,065 units in transit (expected arrivals in Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80%, meaning the OR backend will aim for a base stock that covers expected demand plus a safety margin. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand stabilizing around 250 units, and default for sigma_hat and L as there are no significant deviations from promised lead time or overall volatility profiles.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, a stable lingerie item. Analysis of the first 7 periods shows demand has stabilized after an initial spike, with the last 3 periods averaging 240 units (250, 216, 253). The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7). Currently, there are 341 units on hand and 963 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). Given the stable demand pattern and consistent lead time, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while excluding the high initial demand noise from Periods 1-3. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering based on the early stock-out period demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1, P2, and P3 arrivals). Demand regime stabilized around 240/period after Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $792.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's cotton lace thongs. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, and P8 arrivals all confirm L=4). Demand from P4-P8 has stabilized at a mean of 256 units (278, 250, 216, 253, 283). Total pipeline inventory (in-transit + on-hand) is 1021 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat yields a mean of 256, so (1+4)*256 = 1280. Our current position is slightly below this target, but since we have a large in-transit volume and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio that suggests a 0.8 service level (q = 4/(4+1)), we maintain the calculated lead time and adjust mu/sigma to focus on the stabilized regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of cotton thongs, which generally has stable demand but can be influenced by basic replacement cycles. Historically, after a volatile start, demand has stabilized. The last 5 periods show demands of [250, 216, 253, 283, 176], averaging 235.6. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the last five concluding messages (P5 through P9). Current on-hand inventory is 251, with 894 in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to reflect the current stability, and the default L (promised 4) as it has proven accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $265.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) shows a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, consistent across all arrived shipments so far (P5 through P10). Demand has shifted following an initial high-demand period; the most recent 6 periods (P5-P10) show a mean demand of approximately 224.5 units/period (250, 216, 253, 283, 176, 169). Although there was a peak in Period 8 (late March/early April), the two most recent periods show a downward trend (176 and 169). Given the date (April 22), we are post-Easter/spring peak. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P4 regime, which is more representative than the full history. The pipeline (675) plus on-hand (411) units are substantial, so parameters will likely result in a small or zero order this period to manage holding costs as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5 to 10 averaged 224.5, significantly lower than the P1-P4 average of 277.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

=== Period 11 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for SKU 464297007 as of Period 12 (Apr 29, 2019) shows that demand has softened recently, averaging ~174 units per period over the last three weeks (P9-P11). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 500 units on-hand and 533 units in transit, the current inventory position (1,033) is relatively high compared to recent demand trends. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level that captures the $4 profit, I will use a recent_N approach for demand. Specifically, I'll use N=7 (covering Periods 5-11) to capture the lower demand regime since the initial stock-out period ended. This provides a balance between the very low recent numbers and the higher averages seen earlier in the season. For volatility, I will also use N=7 to reflect the current regime's standard deviation. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period arrival pattern is stable and well-documented in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 9-11 average dropped to 173.7, compared to P5-P8 average of 250.5. Total P5-P11 average is 213.3.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 464297007 (Womens Thong 3p) shows a fluctuating mean. Periods 1-4 averaged ~277, Periods 5-11 dropped to ~224, but Period 12 saw a spike to 323. This spike might be related to local seasonality/promotions in early May. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. However, in Period 12, there was no arrival because 0 units were ordered in Period 8. In-transit inventory is currently 674 units, representing orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12 (expected arrivals in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Given the sudden jump back to 323 demand, using a short-term window (recent_N=5) for the mean and standard deviation will help the OR engine react to this potential upward shift while accounting for the confirmed stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 12 (323 units) after a lower-demand period (avg ~213 for P5-P11), suggesting a potential seasonal shift for Women's Lingerie in early May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (Date: 2019/5/13), we are managing a 'Womens Lingerie' item. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 9 order arrived in Period 13, lead_time=4). There was a missing 'arrived' message for the Period 8 order in the Period 12 conclude, but since that order was 0 units, it is consistent with the timeline. Demand has shown significant volatility: from an average of ~213 for P5-P11, it spiked to 323 in P12 and then dropped to 122 in P13. This creates a high signal-to-noise ratio. Given the product category and the date (mid-May), we may be entering a more irregular demand phase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since Period 5, covering the current demand regime which includes both high and low extremes. This N provides enough context to smooth the recent volatility while ignoring the early start-up period (P1-P4). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time history.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Women's Lingerie' item shows a peak in Period 12 (323 units) followed by a return to lower levels (122 and 151 units in P13-P14). The period 5-11 average was approximately 213, but the most recent 6 periods (P9-P14) average is 178. Given the volatility observed recently, a recent_N window for demand captures the current lower regime while remaining responsive. For Period 14, an order from P10 arrived correctly with a lead time of 4. However, the order from Period 8 (ordered 0 units) means there was no arrival for P12, which explains the 'arrived=0' status in the P12 conclude message. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will set L=4, mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to account for the recent slowdown and the P12 spike, and sigma_hat based on the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further after P12 spike; P9-P14 average demand is 177.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) is currently in a stable demand regime following a brief spike in Period 12. Analysis of the demand history excluding that outlier shows a mean of approximately 175 units over the most recent 6 periods (P9-P11, P13-P15). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-11 and 13-15. Note that Period 12's order arrival (from Period 8) was missing because the order quantity for Period 8 was zero, which explains why the 'arrived' count was 0 in Period 12 without indicating a shipment loss. Current on-hand inventory is 266 with 626 in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean demand of ~175, the target base stock (ignoring the z-score for a moment) would be roughly 875. Our current total position is 266 (on-hand) + 626 (in-transit) = 892. This indicates we are well-stocked. I will set mu_hat using the recent 7 periods (N=7, covering P9-P15) to capture the lower demand regime while including the P12 spike to maintain a conservative buffer for potential seasonal volatility in May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for Greta Thong 3p has stabilized after a brief spike in late April. Over the last three periods (P14-P16), demand has averaged 174 units, which aligns with the post-April trend mentioned in previous insights. The order from Period 8 (0 units) was scheduled to arrive in Period 12, explaining why 'arrived=0' was reported then; current lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 207 and a solid pipeline of 634 units (ordered in P13, P14, P16), we are well-covered for the lead time plus review period (5 periods). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current demand level of ~174 units per period (4 * 174 = 696 across 4 review+lead periods) and use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the Period 12 volatility spike while the system computes the safety stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) shows stabilized demand. Current demand (Period 17: 154) is consistent with the lower regime observed since Period 9. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17: [122, 151, 171, 200, 154]) is 159.6, which is a better forecasting anchor than the long-term average (216.7) or the spike in Period 12 (323). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 17 (P13 order arrived). With 398 on-hand and 385 in-transit (orders from P14, P16, P17), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this current regime and avoid over-ordering based on the early-period highs while maintaining the stock level for the inferred 4-period lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) is currently in Period 19 (mid-June). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, with the Period 14 order arriving exactly on time in Period 18. Recent demand has shown volatility: Period 18 saw 281 units, significantly higher than the previous five-period average (~160). This aligns with a potential early summer seasonal uptick observed in earlier months. The current on-hand inventory (257) and in-transit (314) total 571 units. Using the prompt's base stock logic (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) where q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8, z* = 0.84. Considering the recent five periods (P14-P18), the average demand is 191.4 units/period. To account for the recent spike (281) and potential early summer demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while projecting demand across the (1+L) = 5 period window. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently returned 4 periods since Period 5.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand spike observed at Period 18 (281 units), continuing the volatile trend for Women's Lingerie noted since May (Period 13). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we experienced a massive demand spike (demand=556), which completely depleted our on-hand inventory (ending inventory=0). This indicates a strong seasonal peak in late June for Women\u2019s Lingerie, likely driven by summer retail trends. This spike follows a previous smaller spike in Period 18 (281 units). The observed demand over the last two periods (avg ~418) is significantly higher than the previous baseline (~180). Although we have 594 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19), our on-hand inventory is currently 0, putting us at significant risk of lost sales if subsequent arrivals are delayed or if demand remains elevated. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by historical arrivals). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the immediate surge in demand while acknowledging the volatility, and I will set sigma_hat to 'explicit' to account for the high variance observed during this spike and prevent stockouts during the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed for late June (Period 19 demand: 556). Demand volatility has increased significantly compared to the May baseline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer peak for Women's Lingerie (Period 21, July 1st). Recent demands (P18: 281, P19: 556, P20: 261) signify a massive increase or volatility compared to the previous spring average of ~178. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and lost significant sales in P19 and P20. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The order from P17 (96 units) is expected to arrive during P21, but it will not be enough to cover the current peak demand. Given the sharp spike and subsequent stockout, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the elevated summer demand regime (average ~366 units/period). Setting parameters to target these higher levels is necessary to recover from the stockout and meet persistent summer demand, while the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive over-ordering if the spike is transient.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: P18-P20 average demand increased to 366 units (+105% vs spring baseline). Stockout occurred due to this rapid shift.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer period for Women's Lingerie (July 8th). History shows a transition from a low-demand spring (avg ~175) to a volatile, higher-demand summer. Demand peaked in late June (P19: 556) and has settled into a higher range (P20-21 avg: 231). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (promised = actual). Given current stockouts and the trend, we must maintain a high base stock to capture these elevated summer sales. The recent 4 periods (P18-P21) capture the summer shift best, with an average demand of 324.75 units. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to ensure we are forecasting based on this summer regime rather than the lower annual average. Sigma_hat is set to the recent 4 periods to account for the significantly higher volatility observed during the peak shifts.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime fully established: P18-P21 average demand is 324.8 units, significantly higher than the P9-P17 average of 185.3. Volatility remains high during peak summer weeks (late June to early July).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23), following a significant summer demand peak that began in late June. The average demand from Period 18 to 22 is approximately 328 units, with a notable spike to 556 in Period 19. The system has experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending On-hand: 0) because arrived inventory (69 to 149 units) was insufficient to meet this higher demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the summer peak in Underwear/Womens Lingerie is likely to persist through July but may begin tapering in August, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 'summer regime' (last 5 periods). sigma_hat will be calculated over the same period to account for the high volatility (values ranging from 201 to 556). Current in-transit is very high (1852 units) due to aggressive ordering in Periods 20 and 21 (640 and 638 units respectively). These large orders are expected to arrive in Period 24 and 25, which should finally resolve the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (P18-P22): Average demand ~328 units/period with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 140). Significant backlog of demand (stockouts P19-P22) likely means high capture of any arriving inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1120.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 18-23: 281, 556, 261, 201, 341, 422) confirms a high-demand summer regime with an average of 343.6 units, significantly higher than the spring baseline of ~180. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. Persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P19-P23) indicate that demand is likely higher than reported sales and that existing pipeline inventory is being consumed immediately upon arrival. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this summer peak while maintaining the calculate method for lead time to average out any minor jitter. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the significantly increased volatility observed since the start of June (Period 18).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime confirmed (P18-P23): Average demand increased to ~344 units per period with very high volatility, likely peaking in late June/July for this product category.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend for product 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) shows a high-demand summer peak that significantly increased in late June (P19-P23), but Period 24 demand dropped to 135 units. This suggests the summer peak might be subsiding as we enter late July (Date: 2019/7/29). However, the average demand of the last 7 periods (P18-P24) is approximately 313.8 units, while the standard deviation remains very high. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 505 units on-hand and 1,320 units in-transit (P21-P24 orders), we are well-covered for the coming weeks if demand continues to normalize. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the most recent summer regime while allowing for the recent drop to influence the forecast, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during this peak period. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime potentially subsiding: Period 24 demand (135) is significantly lower than P19-P23 avg (356), though cumulative P18-P24 average remains elevated at 313.8.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The peak summer demand regime for this product (Womens Lingerie) appears to have subsided, as evidenced by the last two periods (P24: 135, P25: 133). This is a significant drop from the P19-P23 average of ~356 units. The current date (August 5) also matches the typical end of the summer season in retail. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this immediate downward shift and avoid overstocking, as inventory has already ballooned to 1010 units following the arrival of large orders placed during the peak. Given the high volatility observed during June and July, I am using a larger window (N=8) for sigma_hat to maintain a safety buffer while the new lower demand level stabilizes. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: Summer peak ended; average demand dropped from ~350 to ~135 (-60%) as of early August.

Daily Reward (R_t): $391.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' has entered a new regime following the summer peak (June/July). Period 24 demand was 135, Period 25 was 133, and Period 26 saw a localized spike to 339, potentially due to clearing backlogged demand or late-summer promotion. Excluding the Period 26 spike as a possible outlier in the downward trend, the mean demand from Period 24-25 is approximately 134 units. We are currently in mid-August, a period typically seeing a reduction in summer-specific lingerie demand. On-hand inventory is high (965 units) due to large orders placed during the peak arriving now (638 arriving P25, 294 arriving P26). With nearly 1000 units on hand and 399 in transit, the current inventory is sufficient for roughly 7-8 periods of demand at the new lower rate (avg ~180-200 if including the P26 spike). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P24-P26) to capture the sharp drop from the 300+ peak while acknowledging the recent P26 variability.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed: Period 24-26 average demand is 202, a significant decrease from the P18-P23 peak average of 344 (-41%). High inventory levels (965 on-hand) will now be carried as demand cools in August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Women's Lingerie (Greta Thong) has clearly transitioned out of its summer peak (late June/July) and is stabilizing into a post-summer regime. Demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) has been 135, 133, 339, and 243, averaging approximately 212 units. This is roughly a 40% decrease from the summer peak average of ~350 observed in P18-P23. We are currently carrying a significant inventory surplus (768 units on-hand + 353 in-transit = 1121 total pipeline), which was ordered during the peak to combat stockouts. At the current demand rate of ~212, this pipeline covers over 5 periods of demand, including the 4-period lead time. To avoid escalating holding costs as demand cools in August/September, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the lower post-peak mean (~212 vs the lifetime mean of ~255). sigma_hat is set to the same window to capture the current volatility. No new large orders are expected due to the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend given our current high inventory level.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned out of its summer peak (late June/July) into a lower late-summer/autumn regime. In the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 190 units, a sharp drop from the ~340 units seen during the peak. We currently have excess inventory (1,010 units on-hand) due to large orders placed during the stockout phase arriving after the peak subsided. With an average demand of 190 and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover approximately (1+4)*190 = 950 units. Since on-hand inventory (1,010) already exceeds this coverage requirement, and there's additional stock in-transit (139), the OR backend will naturally reduce ordering to zero to burn off this surplus and minimize holding costs ($1/unit). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and calculation for lead time to reflect the new, lower regime while maintaining safety stock for potential volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for Period 24-28 (late July-August) averaged 190 units/period, down from peak of 344 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The summer demand peak for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) has clearly subsided. Since Period 24 (late July), demand has averaged approximately 179 units per period (Demands: 135, 133, 339, 243, 100, 124), excluding the P26 outlier which may have been a brief clearance spike. The most recent demand (P28-P29) is even lower, averaging 112 units. We currently have a substantial inventory surplus with 897 units on-hand and 128 in-transit (ordered P28), while Lead Time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current cooled-off demand regime, the priority is to avoid further holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-summer average (~179 units) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this transition. This will likely result in zero orders until the current stock is drawn down.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P24-P29) stabilized at an average of ~179 units/period, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~344. On-hand inventory is currently excessive (897 units) relative to this new demand level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Women's Lingerie (SKU 464297007) has clearly shifted into a post-summer low or 'early autumn' regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) has averaged 167.9 units, a significant drop from the summer peak average of ~344. Currently, the system holds 796 units on-hand with 173 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 969 units). At the current average demand of ~168/period, this inventory covers approximately 5.7 periods. Since the lead time is 4 periods and we are in a low-demand regime, we are currently overstocked. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand and lower volatility. With on-hand inventory significantly exceeding the likely base stock calculation, the OR engine will likely result in a zero or near-zero order, allowing the inventory levels to draw down and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P24-P30) average demand has further declined to 168 units/period, confirming a sustained lower-demand period for early autumn.

The demand for 'Greta Thong' (Women's Lingerie) has transitioned from a high-summer peak (Avg ~344, P18-P23) to a significantly lower early autumn regime. For the most recent period (P24-P31), the average demand is 156.5 units, with the last two periods dropping to 101 and 77. The current on-hand inventory is 719 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of the current average demand (156.5) and many more of the most recent demand (77). With 213 units already in-transit, total coverage is nearly 6 periods, which is well above the (L+1=5) period target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the excessive on-hand inventory relative to the cooling demand, the goal is to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 8 periods (late July to early September) to capture this downward trend and use a recent Window for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: P24-P31 average demand is 156.5 (-54% vs summer peak). Demand is trending further downward into mid-September (P31 demand: 77).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand decline for this Women's Lingerie SKU. Looking at the demand from Period 24 to 32, the average is approximately 160 units/period, but more recent periods (P28-P32) show a mean of ~119.2 units/period, with a spike in the most recent period (P32: 194). Despite the P32 spike, the overall trend since August has been significantly lower than the summer peak of ~344. On-hand inventory is very high at 653 units, which covers more than 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~120-130 units/period). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the excessive current pipeline relative to the cooling demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average (N=5 for the P28-P32 period) to ensure the base stock calculation aligns with the current seasonal cooling.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: P28-P32 average demand is ~120 units/period, a further decrease from the late-summer levels (~180). High on-hand inventory (653) continues to buffer against recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23), a massive demand spike of 692 units occurred, which completely depleted the stock (on-hand is now 0). This spike is over 5x the recent average (approx 120) and resembles the late June peak. For a 'Greta Thong 3p', this might indicate a late-September promotion or a 'back-to-school/university' seasonal effect. Current inventory position is extremely weak: 0 on-hand and only 103 in-transit (from orders in P30-32). To recover, I need to raise the base stock significantly. I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the average of the last 2 periods (approx 440) to bridge the gap between the pre-spike level and the spike itself, while using recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in late September (Period 33: 692 units) suggests a new high-demand regime or major promotional event, breaking the post-summer cooling trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following a period of cooling demand, we observed a massive spike in Period 33 (692 units) and a continued high demand in Period 34 (335 units). This suggests a new high-demand regime, possibly due to a mid-autumn promotion or seasonal shift for 'Womens Lingerie'. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 922 units in transit (including an 864-unit order from Period 34). The goal is to set parameters that recognize this new high-volume, high-volatility state. I am using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition, as the last three periods (P32-P34) represent the shift from cooling to spiking demand. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 33: Demand spiked to 692 (P33) and 335 (P34), breaking the previous cooling trend. Average demand for P32-P34 is 407 units, indicating high volatility and a sharp upward shift in early October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began abruptly in late September (Period 33). Demand for this 'Womens Lingerie' item spiked to 692 (P33), followed by 335 (P34) and 123 (P35). This suggests a significant seasonal shift or promotion relative to the low August/September baseline (~150). The average demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) is 383.3 units, compared to the P28-P32 average of ~120. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and reliant on the massive 'In-transit' pipeline (1712 units) scheduled over the next few periods (derived from orders in P34 and P35). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To manage the current volatility and capture this harvest period while accounting for the high order quantities already placed, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new post-spike regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that bridges the gap between the recent high-demand peaks and the incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Average demand increased from ~150 to ~383 (+155%) with high volatility, likely representing an autumn/early winter lifting period for Lingerie.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 33 (late September/early October). Demand peaked at 692 (P33) and has remained elevated despite stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline (2440 units) following large orders in Periods 34-36. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this autumn regime (P33-P36), which shows an average demand of ~312.5 units despite censored data (sales were limited by stock). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recent conclusion (P36 saw arrival of P32 order). Setting parameters to ensure the OR backend maintains a high base stock during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn/winter demand lift confirmed starting Period 33; average demand (P33-P36) increased to ~312 units despite stockouts, shifting from the sub-200 late-summer average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained autumn/winter high-demand regime that began around Period 33 (late September). Recent demand has been constrained by stockouts, but the underlying need is high; Period 33 demand was 692, and despite limited stock, we continue to see significant unmet demand. The current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and 2440 units in-transit, largely from the heavy orders placed in Periods 34-36 (864, 830, and 746 units). Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, these large orders will begin arriving in Period 38 (the order from P34) and continue through Period 40. For Period 37, 'arrived=0' is expected as no order was placed in Period 33. I will maintain a high mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (P33-P37) which is approximately 275 units per period including the spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this seasonal lift. Sigma_hat is also set using the same recent window to capture the increased volatility of this regime. I will use L=4 (promised/actual) to align with the confirmed delivery pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-289.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong' (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned from a sharp autumn lift (Period 33-34) to a more moderate sustained level in late October. Period 33-34 saw a massive spike (avg. ~513), but the last four periods (P35-P38) have averaged 115.5 units, though stockouts in P35-P37 likely suppressed the true demand signal. With Period 38 showing demand of 115 and starting on-hand inventory recovered to 749, we are currently well-stocked. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods. Given the high volatility observed in this category (autumn/holiday variability), I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the trend change since the P33 spike, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation observed during these regime shifts. This ensures we don't over-react to the P33 outlier while maintaining enough stock for potential November surges.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: After the sharp late-September spike (P33-34 avg: 513), demand moderated to an average of 115.5 units (P35-P38), though partially suppressed by stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) is currently in a post-spike moderation phase. After a massive demand surge in late September/early October (Period 33-34 avg: 513), demand has stabilized at a lower level. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 140.6 units, reflecting a cooling trend similar to previous seasonal shifts observed in this category. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (1338 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (864 and 830 units in P34-35). With an additional 746 units in-transit (ordered P36) expected to arrive in Period 40, the system is significantly overstocked relative to the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current moderated demand level (approx 140/period) and maintain a lead time of 4. This will likely result in zero new orders to allow the excess inventory to bleed off, minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Post-spike demand (P35-P39) has moderated to an average of 140.6 units/period, down from the P33-P34 peak of 513 units. High inventory levels (1338 on-hand + 746 in-transit) are now being carried.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-149.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a high-inventory state (1,697 units on-hand) following the arrival of large orders placed during the October demand spike (Periods 34-36). Historical demand shows significant volatility: a massive late-September spike (692 units), followed by a moderation to ~140 units, and then a recent uptick in Period 40 (387 units). This suggests potential preparation for a pre-holiday or Black Friday surge, typical for this retail category. However, with 1,697 units on-hand and an average demand of approximately 213 units over the last 8 periods (P33-P40), the current inventory covers roughly 8 weeks of supply. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and the backend capped policy will account for pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture the increased mean and volatility of this autumn/winter regime. Given the excessive on-hand stock and no current in-transit orders, the OR backend will likely recommend zero orders (cap/base stock logic), preventing further unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the upcoming weeks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn/winter demand regime (P33-P40) shows an average demand of ~213 units/period with high volatility, characterized by sharp spikes (692 in P33, 387 in P40) and intervening moderate periods (~120-240).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the lead-up to the holiday season (Black Friday occurred in Period 41, and December/Christmas peaks are approaching). Historical demand for this 'Womens Lingerie' item shows significant volatility with recent peaks of 387 (P40) and 348 (P41). The carry-over insights correctly identified a sustained higher-demand regime starting around P33, though it is marked by sharp spikes rather than a steady mean. Currently, we have 1,349 units on-hand, which is quite high relative to recent demand (avg P37-P41 is ~243). In-transit is negligible (11 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the current stock level, we need to avoid further over-ordering while maintaining readiness for a potential December spike. I will use a recent_N (N=9, covering P33-P41) to capture this volatile autumn/winter regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the risk of a holiday surge against the high current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility winter regime confirmed (P33-P41): Average demand is ~275 units with significant spikes (>340) and troughs (~115). Inventory is currently high (1349 units) heading into late November/December.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a sustained high-volatility winter regime. Over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 280.4 units (115, 241, 387, 348, 311), which aligns with the carry-over insight of a regime shift around Period 33. On-hand inventory is 1038 units, and in-transit is 385 units (total pipeline: 1423). With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent average of ~280, the expected demand over (1+L) periods is approximately 1400 units. Our current pipeline (1423) is roughly equal to this requirement. However, given the high volatility (max demand reached 692 in P33 and ~387 recently), a conservative approach using the last 5 periods (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is selected to capture this winter lift while accounting for recent high-demand observations. L remains at the promised 4 periods as evidence remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P42) stabilized at an average of ~280 units/period with continued high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 100), significantly higher than the early autumn lows.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand winter regime for December. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is approximately 277 units (115, 241, 387, 348, 311, 266). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory check: On-hand is 772, and In-transit is 566 (ordered P41, P42, P43). Current pipeline inventory (1338 units) covers approximately 4.8 periods of recent average demand (1338 / 277 \u2248 4.8). With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. The current position is slightly below the 5-period requirement (277 * 5 = 1385). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility winter demand regime while keeping the OR backend responsive to the specific average of ~277 units/period observed since mid-October.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P43) stabilized at an average of ~277 units/period with significant volatility (highs of 387, lows of 115). Pipeline currently covers roughly 4.8 periods of demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) is currently in a high-demand winter regime as of mid-December (Period 45). Recent demand (P38-P44) has averaged 284 units per period with significant volatility (highs of 387 and 380). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 392 and a large pipeline (799 units) mostly composed of orders from P42-P44, we need to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period risk window. Given the upcoming holiday season peak for this category, I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current active winter regime (P38-P44). The OR backend will use these to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, aiming for an 80% cycle service level.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P44) confirmed: Average demand is ~284 units/period with sustained high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 93) as of late December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Lingerie' (Greta Thong) is currently in a high-volatility winter/holiday regime. Period 45 demand was 360, following a series of high values (380, 266, 311, 348). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P38-P45) is approximately 301 units with a high standard deviation. We are entering late December (Period 46, Dec 23rd), which usually marks the peak or the start of a post-holiday transition. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is critically low at 43 units, but there is a large in-transit pipeline of 1238 units (ordered P42-P45). Given the proximity to the holiday peak, I will maintain the current demand regime parameters (N=8) to ensure we cover remaining holiday demand while accounting for high volatility, but I will monitor for a post-Christmas drop in the next period.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P45) average demand is ~301 units/period with sustained high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 95) as of late December.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The winter demand regime (starting around Period 38) for this Women's Lingerie item has stabilized at a high level. Demand over the last 9 periods (P38-P46) averages approximately 305 units per period, with sustained high volatility (standard deviation ~85-95). We are currently in the late December/early January window, which typically sees high retail activity. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 59 units on-hand and 1,261 units in-transit, and given the backend OR logic (base stock = \u03bc_hat + z*\u03c3_hat), I will set \u03bc_hat for the 5-period risk window (L+1) using a recent N of 9 to capture the current high-demand winter regime (~1525 units). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the significant volatility observed since late October (approx 200 for the window). This positioning ensures we cover the current high sales velocity while the OR backend manages the sizeable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P46) average demand confirmed at ~305 units/period with sustained high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 90) as of end of December.
