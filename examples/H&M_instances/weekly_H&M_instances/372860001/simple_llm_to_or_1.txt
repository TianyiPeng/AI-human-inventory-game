======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the last five periods shows a slight upward trend followed by stabilization: [231, 255, 302, 272, 272]. The average demand is 266.4. The current date is February 11, 2019, which is in the post-winter/early spring transition. Given the product is 'fine-knit trainer socks', demand typically increases as weather warms and consumers shift away from heavy winter socks. The recent stabilization at 272 suggests a plateau after an initial jump, but given the seasonal relevance of trainer socks starting in February, a slight maintenance or minor increase of the current level is expected.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Socks) shows a baseline range of 231-302 units across the training data. The first test period (2019/02/11) recorded 287 units, which is consistent with the higher end of the historical range. Mid-February is generally a stable period for basic hosiery (trainer socks), though demand may begin to pick up slightly as warmer weather approaches in certain regions. Given the move from 287 in Period 1 and the previous training mean (~266), the trend remains stable with a slight upward bias. I forecast a demand of 280 for Period 2, maintaining the current regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for this SKU (Womens trainer socks) showed a relatively stable range between 231 and 302 units. In the recent test periods, Period 1 aligned with this baseline at 287 units. However, Period 2 (2019/02/18) saw a massive spike to 548 units (+91% over Period 1). This spike aligns with the typical 'Spring/Summer' transition in fashion retail where trainer socks become highly relevant as weather warms and consumers shift away from boots to sneakers. Period 3 (2019/02/25) is the final week of February, continuing this seasonal momentum. I expect demand to remain elevated far above the historic baseline, though it may stabilize slightly after the initial surge.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed a stable range between 231 and 302 units (avg: 266). However, the observed test data indicates a significant regime shift starting in Period 2. Demand jumped to 548 in Period 2 and settled at 399 in Period 3. This SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) typically sees increased demand as the weather warms in early March (transitioning from full socks to trainer socks). While Period 2 was likely a peak triggered by initial spring shopping/promotions, the demand remains significantly higher than the baseline. Period 4 (2019/3/4) is expected to maintain this higher level but stabilize slightly as the initial surge peaks. I forecast 385 units, reflecting a new higher operational mean compared to the training period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift starting Feb 18 (Period 2): Average demand increased from ~266 to ~445 (+67%) in the last 3 periods, likely driven by seasonal transition into trainer socks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Initial demand started at 287 (P1), spiked significantly to 548 (P2), then gradually corrected downwards to 399 (P3) and 338 (P4). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Early March (Current Date 2019/3/11) marks the transition into spring, where demand for trainer socks typically rises compared to winter, but the initial burst in late February/early March (P2-P3) suggests an early-season stocking/purchasing peak. (3) Recent trend: There is a clear downward correction from the P2 peak. The average of the 'high' regime (P2-P4) is 428, but the specific trajectory is 548 -> 399 -> 338. (4) Final forecast logic: Demand is stabilizing after the initial seasonal surge. Period 4 (338) is nearing the pre-spike level (287) but remains slightly elevated. I expect demand to flatten or slightly decrease further as the initial novelty of the spring season wears off, settling near the 310-330 range.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (fine-knit trainer socks) showed a massive spike in Period 2 (548 units) and Period 3 (399 units), which was previously identified as a seasonal regime shift. However, recent data shows a rapid deceleration: Period 4 dropped to 338 units and Period 5 fell further to 252 units. This suggests the initial spring 'stock-up' spike has subsided, and demand is returning to a baseline similar to the training data average (~266) and Period 1 level (287). The current date (March 18) is early spring; while trainer socks are relevant, the immediate surge has passed. Period 5 demand (252) is very close to the historical training average of 266. I predict demand will stabilize near this baseline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) showed a significant spike in Period 2 (548 units) as the seasonal transition began, but has since stabilized downwards. The average demand across the first six periods is approximately 358 units; however, looking specifically at the most recent three periods (P4-P6), the average has cooled significantly to 306 units. The product description (fine-knit trainer socks) suggests increasing relevance as spring progresses, but the 'Carry-over Insight' suggesting a sustained shift to ~445 has not been maintained, as demand dropped to 252 (P5) and 329 (P6). Given the historical training average was ~266 and the current trend is fluctuating around the low 300s, I expect demand for Period 7 to remain stable near the recent average, accounting for a slight seasonal uptick as weather warms in late March.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal, peaking as weather warms in spring. Looking at the demand history: after an initial spike in late Feb (Period 2), demand dipped back down but is now showing a clear upward trajectory in the most recent three periods (P5: 252, P6: 329, P7: 415). The current date is April 1st, marking the beginning of the spring season where demand for trainer socks typically accelerates. The average of the last two periods is 372, but the trend is strongly positive (+26% growth from P6 to P7). Expecting the upward momentum to continue into April, I forecast a slight increase over the most recent observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $973.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~266 units. During the test phase (Periods 1-8), demand has shifted upward as we entered the spring season, which is peak timing for trainer socks. While there was a significant spike in Period 2 (548) followed by a dip in Period 5 (252), the most recent three periods (6, 7, 8) show a sustained recovery with values of 329, 415, and 382 (average ~375). This indicates the product has settled into a higher demand regime compared to the baseline. For Period 9 (April 8), I expect demand to remain strong and relatively stable around this new baseline of ~380-400 units as spring weather continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Baseline has moved from training average of 266 to a spring average of ~375 (+41%) over the last 8 weeks, reflecting seasonal relevance for trainer socks.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see increased demand during the spring season. Historical demand for the training period averaged 266 units. Since Period 2 (late February), demand has shifted to a higher baseline, averaging approximately 376 units over the last 8 periods (Periods 2-9). Recent demand has shown some fluctuation: Period 7 (415), Period 8 (382), and Period 9 (322). The current date is April 15, 2019. While Period 9 saw a slight dip, the seasonal relevance for trainer socks remains high in mid-April. Given the established spring baseline and recent volatility around the 350-400 range, I expect demand to stabilize near the recent mean.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees increased demand during the spring/summer transition. Historical demand in the test phase initially spiked in Period 2 (548) and has since stabilized. The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 7-10) is 356.75 units. Looking at the most recent trend, there is a slight sequential decline (415 -> 382 -> 322 -> 308). The current date is April 22, 2019, which is the day after Easter Sunday; typically, post-holiday weeks can see a stabilization or slight dip in retail demand before the full summer ramp-up. Given the steady decline over the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain in the 300-320 range.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees increased demand during the spring and summer months. Historical data for the test phase shows a higher baseline (avg ~370) compared to the initial training data (avg ~266). Recent demand has been somewhat volatile but generally sustained: Period 9 (322), Period 10 (308), and a significant jump in Period 11 (427). This recent spike in Period 11 (late April) aligns with improving weather and the transition to low-cut footwear. Given the 'trainer sock' category and the upward movement in the most recent week, I expect demand to remain elevated near the current spring average. Averaging the last four weeks (322, 308, 427) gives 352, but given the seasonal momentum moving into May, I will forecast slightly above that average.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see increased demand as temperatures rise in spring. Historical demand (Periods 1-12) shows a fluctuating but generally elevated baseline compared to the training period (avg 266). Recent demand in Periods 11 and 12 (427, 438) shows a significant uptick, likely corresponding to the transition into May and warmer weather. The date for Period 13 is May 6th, 2019. Given the trend of the last two weeks and the seasonal relevance of trainer socks in May, I expect demand to remain high or slightly increase. A small upward adjustment from the recent average (432.5) is warranted as spring peak continues.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward trend in late Spring: Period 11-12 show a return to high-demand levels (>420 units), confirming a secondary seasonal peak for trainer socks as weather warms.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The product (trainer socks) showed an initial demand spike in late February, followed by a stabilization around 320-380 units. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: As of mid-May (Period 14), the demand for trainer socks typically remains high or increases as temperatures rise. (3) Recent trend analysis: Periods 11 and 12 showed a strong surge (avg ~432), but Period 13 saw a sharp drop to 267. (4) Final forecast logic: The drop in Period 13 (May 6) may be a temporary fluctuation or influenced by a local holiday/bridge day effect rather than a permanent regime change. Given the product's seasonal relevance in May, demand is expected to recover toward the medium-term average established during the spring months (approx. 350-380 units), rather than staying at the low Period 13 level.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 15 (2019-05-20) shows a significant decline from the high-demand peak observed in late April/early May. After reaching levels above 400 (P11-12), demand dropped sharply to 267 (P13) and 275 (P14). This drop brings the demand volume back to the baseline level observed during the training period (approx. 266) and late February. While the carry-over insight from P13 suggested an upward trend, the most recent two weeks indicate a cooling-off period or a post-seasonal peak lull. Given the date (late May), trainer socks remain seasonally relevant, but the immediate trend is flat at a lower level. I forecast a slight stabilization near the current two-week average, accounting for typical late-spring consistency.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during late spring and summer. Historical data shows a volatile but elevated demand compared to the initial training average of 266. After a significant dip in Periods 13 and 14 (likely a post-peak correction or temporary fluctuation), demand has begun to recover in Period 15 (348 units). As the date is May 27th, we are entering the peak summer season for trainer socks. I expect demand to continue its recovery towards the spring average of ~375-400 identified in previous insights, but I will remain conservative due to the recent volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is highly seasonal, peaking as weather warms. Historically, demand shifted from a baseline of ~266 (Period 1) to a spring average of ~375. After a significant dip in Periods 13 and 14 (avg ~271), which may have been a temporary saturation or weather-related lull, demand has rebounded strongly over the last two weeks (Period 15: 348, Period 16: 370). As we enter June (Period 17), temperature-driven demand for trainer socks typically remains high or increases further. Given the current upward trajectory and the established spring baseline, I expect demand to continue its recovery towards the 380-400 level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal, peaking in spring and summer. Historical data shows high volatility. After a secondary peak in Periods 11-12 (>420 units), demand dropped significantly in Periods 13-14 (~270), followed by a recovery in Periods 15-16 (348, 370). Period 17 saw a dip to 297 units. As the current date is June 10 (Period 18), we are in the peak summer season for trainer socks. Looking at the last 5 periods (13-17), the average is approximately 311 units. However, given the product type and the time of year, demand typically fluctuates around a mid-high baseline. The 297 units in Period 17 appears to be a minor fluctuation rather than a downward trend, as Periods 15 and 16 showed strength. I expect demand to stabilize or slightly rebound towards the recent average of the last 7 weeks (~330 units).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a fluctuating but generally high demand for trainer socks during spring and early summer. Previous insights noted a baseline shift to ~375 units. However, recent demand (Periods 17-18) has stabilized at a lower level of approximately 295 units, following a mid-May peak (Periods 15-16). Period 19 (June 17) is firmly in the summer season where trainer socks remain highly relevant, but the immediate trend shows a slight cooling from the late-May highs. Given the stability between P17 (297) and P18 (294), I expect demand to remain near this current floor, potentially seeing a minor uptick as summer activities increase. I will forecast a value close to the recent average of ~300.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which are highly seasonal and popular in spring and summer. Historical analysis shows an initial spring surge followed by variability. Recently (the last 3 periods 17-19), demand has stabilized at a slightly lower level than the late April peak, with the last three observations being [297, 294, 334], averaging 308. Looking at the trend since Period 13 (267, 275, 348, 370, 297, 294, 334), there is no clear sustained growth or decline, rather a fluctuating plateau between 270 and 370. The current date is June 24, approaching high summer. Given the recent uptick in Period 19 (334) and the seasonal relevance, the forecast targets the average of the last several weeks while accounting for seasonal maintenance.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (7p Fine-knit trainer socks) is highly seasonal, typically peaking in spring and early summer. Observed demand in the last 4 periods (Periods 17-20) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 303.5 units (297, 294, 334, 289), compared to the late April/early May peak of ~430 units. This suggests the primary spring peak has passed, and demand is settling into a mid-summer baseline. The 'Carry-over Insights' from Period 13 regarding a sustained upward trend no longer apply, as demand has dropped significantly since then. For Period 21 (July 1st), I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent monthly average of ~300 units, as heatwaves often lead to higher usage of trainer socks vs full socks, preventing a total drop-off.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward: Late June average (Periods 17-20) dropped to ~304 units, a 28% decrease from the Spring peak of ~425 units (Periods 11-12).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a series of seasonal fluctuations for these 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. After a peak in late April (Periods 11-12 at ~430 units), demand stabilized into a lower summer regime. Analysis of the most recent five periods (17-21) shows an average demand of 306.2 units, with high stability (range 289-334). The current date (July 8) is peak summer, where trainer socks typically maintain a steady baseline before any late-summer/back-to-school shifts. Period 21 saw 317 units, following 289 in Period 20. Given the consistent recent mean near 305 and no immediate calendar catalysts for a spike or drop, I expect demand to remain within this established summer range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this SKU (trainer socks) shows clear seasonal volatility. After a high-demand period in late Spring (Periods 11-12 at ~430 units), demand downshifted in June to a lower plateau. Analysis of the most recent data (Periods 17-22) shows a stable demand regime with a narrow range between 289 and 334 units. The average for the last six weeks is ~307 units, and the average for the most recent two weeks (Periods 21-22) is 315 units. Given the mid-July date (2019/7/15), demand is expected to remain in this stable summer consolidation phase. The forecast weights the most recent two-week average (315) against the longer-term summer baseline (~307).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (7p Basic Shaftless trainer socks) shows distinct seasonality, peaking in early Spring (April/May) and then stabilizing. Recent demand (Periods 21-23) shows a slight upward movement from the late-June trough, moving from 317 to 313 and then to 352 units. This suggests a stabilization in a new mid-summer baseline. The average over the last four periods (P20-23) is 317.75. Given the recent increase to 352 in Period 23, it is likely that demand is fluctuating around a mean between 310 and 340. I will forecast a slight normalization from the P23 peak while respecting the higher recent average.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for SKU 372860 (Socks) shows distinct seasonal variability. After a high-demand period in Spring (Apr/May), demand stabilized in a lower regime during June and July. Recent demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) has been 317, 313, 352, and 277, resulting in a 4-week moving average of 315 units. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 21 indicating a downward shift to around 304 units. As we move into late July (P25), the demand remains in this stable mid-summer trough. The most recent observation (277) is slightly below the average, but the overall group of the last 4-8 weeks suggests a baseline around 300-320 units. I will forecast a value near the recent average to account for continued summer stability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (7p Basic Shaftless trainer socks) shows distinct seasonality, peaking in early Spring (Period 2, Periods 11-12) and declining as Summer progresses. The Carry-Over Insights noted a downward shift in late June to around 304 units. Looking at the most recent five periods (21-25), the demand has continued to soften: 317, 313, 352, 277, and 256. The average of the last two periods is ~266 units, indicating a move towards a late-summer baseline before any potential autumn shifts. Given the date is August 5th, demand for trainer socks typically remains stable or slightly decreases further as the focus shifts toward full-length socks for back-to-school/fall. I will forecast a slight stabilization near the most recent levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward trend into late summer: average demand for Periods 24-25 (266 units) is significantly lower than the July average of ~327, marking a return to Feb baseline levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for trainer socks has shown a clear seasonal cycle, peaking in late spring/early summer and declining through July. Recent observations from Period 24 to 26 (277, 256, 258) confirm a stabilization at a lower baseline, consistent with the Carry-over Insight from Period 26. As of mid-August, there is no evidence of a 'back-to-school' spike yet for this specific SKU, and the mean demand over the last two weeks (~257) suggests a steady-state. The forecast assumes this stabilization continues.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for this SKU (trainer socks). Demand peaked in Spring/early Summer (Avg ~375-430) and has been steadily declining as we move into late Summer. Recent periods (24-27) show a stabilized lower baseline: 277, 256, 258, and 301. The average over these last four weeks is 273 units. The slight uptick in Period 27 (301) coincides with mid-August, which often sees a minor 'Back to School' lift for basic hosiery like cotton-blend trainer socks. However, given the sustained downward trend into late summer noted in the carry-over insights, the forecast should remain conservative around the recent average while acknowledging the slight rebound in the most recent week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) shows clear seasonal fluctuations. After a spring peak exceeding 400 units, demand declined during the summer, stabilizing around a lower baseline. Specifically, Periods 24-26 averaged approximately 264 units. However, the last two periods (Period 27: 301, Period 28: 294) indicate a slight recovery or stabilization around the ~300 unit mark. Since the current date (August 26) aligns with 'Back to School' shopping\u2014a period often associated with renewed interest in basic hosiery and socks\u2014a slight uptick or continued stability relative to the mid-August levels is expected. The recent three-period average is 284 units, but the very recent trend (294-301) suggests a baseline closer to 300.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) shows a clear seasonal pattern related to warmer weather, with peaks in Spring and early Summer. Since July, demand has been on a sustained downward trend as the season transitions towards autumn. The 'Carry-over Insights' note a return to baseline levels (~266) around Period 26. Looking at the most recent four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged 270.5 units, but the most recent observation (P29) shows a sharp drop to 229, the lowest since the training data. Given that September typically marks a shift away from 'trainer socks' towards heavier legwear, a slight further cooling or stabilization at these lower levels is expected. I will weight the recent average and the most recent drop significantly.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-summer decline: Average demand for Periods 26-29 has dropped to ~271 units, with Period 29 reaching 229, confirming the end of the high-demand season for trainer socks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal, peaking in spring/early summer and declining as weather cools in September. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend from the spring peak (~425 units) to the late summer average (~271 units). The most recent periods (29 and 30) recorded 229 and 274 units respectively, suggesting a stabilization at a lower late-season baseline. Date 2019/09/09 marks the start of the autumn transition where trainer sock demand typically softens further. Given the carry-over insight noting a sustained decline and the recent bounce from 229 to 274, the forecast predicts a demand slightly below the 4-week average (274.5) to account for worsening seasonality.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is highly seasonal, peaking in Spring and early Summer. Historical data and carry-over insights show a clear downward trend as we move into late Summer and early Autumn. Specifically, Period 30's insight noted a sustained decline to a late-summer average of ~271 units. The most recent observations (Periods 29-31: 229, 274, 254) confirm a lower demand regime averaging ~252 units. As of Sept 16 (Period 32), the weather cooling typical for Autumn further reduces the relevance of trainer socks compared to full-length socks. Given the stability of the last two periods (274 and 254), a forecast near the recent average of ~255-260 is appropriate.

For the most recent 4 periods (Periods 29-32), the average demand has stabilized at approximately 251 units (229, 274, 254, 248), which is a notable decrease from the Summer/Spring peak levels. Entering late September (Period 33), the demand for low-cut 'trainer socks' typically continues to decline or remain flat as consumers transition to warmer footwear and full-length socks for Autumn. Given the consistent recent performance below 275 and the downward seasonal pressure, a forecast reflecting the current low-baseline trend is appropriate.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (trainer socks) shows clear seasonality, peaking in Spring/Summer and declining as weather cools. Recent Carry-Over Insights highlighted a sustained downward trend into late summer (avg ~271 units). However, Period 33 (Sept 23) shows a sharp spike to 405 units, which deviates from the recent trend of 229-274 units seen in Periods 29-32. This spike is likely a temporary anomaly or a specific promotion/event rather than a sustained regime shift, as the product (trainer socks) typically loses seasonal relevance heading into October. Given the preceding four-week average of ~251 units and the sudden jump, a conservative forecast is appropriate that acknowledges the spike but weights the established seasonal decline and the training baseline (avg 266) more heavily.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that typically peaks in spring/summer and declines as weather cools. Historical demand shows a significant decline in August and early September (Period 29-32 average: 251 units). However, a sudden spike occurred in Period 33 (405 units), which may be attributed to a promotional event or late-season clearance, followed by a correction to 312 units in Period 34. As the current date is October 7, demand for trainer socks is expected to enter a sustained low-season phase. The recent spike (405) and subsequent drop (312) suggest the 'noise' is clearing, and demand will likely revert toward the baseline levels seen in Periods 30-32 (avg ~258) before potentially dipping further into the colder autumn months. I am forecasting a return to this lower baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that demand for trainer socks (SKU 372860001) follows a clear seasonal pattern, peaking in Spring and early Summer before declining as the weather cools in Autumn. Recent demand following the anomaly spike in Period 33 (405 units) has normalized rapidly: Period 34 (312 units) and Period 35 (266 units). Current date (Oct 14) is deep into Autumn, where consumer preference shifts away from shaftless/trainer socks. The observed demand in Period 35 (266) aligns closely with the baseline established in early Spring and the carry-over insight from Period 30 (avg ~271). Therefore, I forecast demand to remain stable at this lower seasonal baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which historically showed peak demand during warmer spring and early summer months (Feb-June). The carry-over insights and observed data indicate a steady decline since the late summer (Period 30 onwards). While Period 33 showed a brief anomaly spike (405 units), the last three periods (34, 35, 36) show a consistent downward trajectory (312 to 266 to 240). As of late October (Period 37), seasonal demand for trainer socks typically hits its annual low as consumers shift toward heavier socks for winter. Average demand over the last four periods excluding the outlier is ~273, with the most recent observation being 240. I expect the downward trend to continue slightly or stabilize at this lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-summer stabilization: Demand has settled into a lower autumn baseline of ~260-280 units (Periods 34-36), after the transient spike in late September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring/summer and lower demand in colder months. Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal decline since mid-summer, stabilizing in a lower autumn baseline. Periods 34-36 showed a mean of ~273 units. While Period 33 featured a transient spike (405), the subsequent three weeks averaged 272 units. Period 37 (Oct 21) showed a slight uptick to 306 units. However, looking at the broader trend since September (Periods 30-37), the average is 288 units. For late October, as temperatures drop, trainer socks (designed to be low-profile/invisible) generally face further downward pressure compared to standard socks. Given the recent fluctuation (240 in Period 36 to 306 in Period 37), a forecast near the recent average of 270-280 is most appropriate to account for the stabilization noted in Carry-over Insights.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which are typically high-demand in spring and summer and lower in autumn/winter. Historical data shows demand stabilized between 240 and 312 units over the last five periods (P34-P38), following a brief late-September spike. The average of the most recent four periods (P35-P38) is 272 units. Since the current date is November 4th, we are moving further into the colder season where demand for trainer socks usually remains flat or slightly declines. Period 38 saw 276 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of an autumn baseline between 260-280 units. I will forecast a value consistent with this baseline, acknowledging the slight softening trend seen in recent weeks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (7p Basic Shaftless fine-knit trainer socks) is highly seasonal, peaking in spring/summer and declining in autumn/winter. Historical demand shows a transition from the spring/summer peak (~350-450 units) to a stable autumn baseline. In the most recent periods (Periods 35-39), demand has consistently fluctuated around a mean of ~265 units (266, 240, 306, 276, 241). The current date is November 11 (Period 40). Unlike full-length socks, trainer socks typically experience reduced demand in colder months. Comparing the last three weeks (avg: 274) vs. the last week (241), there is a slight downward trend as we move deeper into November. Given the historical autumn baseline identified in previous carry-over insights (260-280 units), and the specific drop to 241 last period, I expect demand to remain in the lower range of this baseline for Period 40.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is seasonally relevant for warmer months and typically experiences lower demand during winter. Historical data shows a clear peak in Spring and a sustained decline throughout late Summer and Autumn. Recent demand for the last five periods (Periods 36-40: 240, 306, 276, 241, 252) averages 263 units, confirming the 'Period 37' carry-over insight of a stabilized autumn baseline between 260-280 units. As we enter mid-November (Period 41), there are no major shopping events yet (Black Friday typically falls in late November), and the cold weather continues to suppress demand for trainer socks. Period 40 showed a slight recovery from Period 39 (252 vs 241), suggesting the baseline is holding steady near its historical training floor (avg [231-302]). I expect demand to remain within this established late-autumn range.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this product (trainer socks) is highly seasonal, with demand peaking in Spring/Summer (>400 units) and declining through Autumn. Recent demand has reached its lowest levels to date, with Period 41 dropping to 210 units and the three-week average (Periods 39-41) sitting at ~234. However, Period 42 (starting 2019/11/25) coincides with the week of Black Friday (Nov 29). Historically, even off-season basics like trainer socks experience significant promotional spikes; for instance, Period 33 saw a ~60% jump from temporary promotions. Given the current downward baseline, I anticipate a notable retail event spike, though tempered by the seasonal irrelevance of trainer socks in late November. I expect demand to rise from the 210 baseline back toward the 300-330 range due to the Black Friday effect.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Nov average (Periods 39-41) dropped to ~234 units, a 14% decrease from the previous Oct baseline (~272), as trainer socks reach their seasonal minimum.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis indicates that SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is highly seasonal, peaking in Spring/Summer and reaching a baseline minimum in late Autumn/Winter. Carry-over insights and recent data confirm a downward regime shift occurring in November, with Period 41 reaching a low of 210. However, Period 42 (2019/11/25) showed a sudden spike to 354 units. Given the date (late November), this is almost certainly driven by 'Black Friday' sales/promotions. Entering Period 43 (2019/12/2), we are in the 'Cyber Monday' week and the start of the holiday shopping season. While trainer socks are less seasonally relevant in winter, the general retail lift from holiday gifting and continuing post-Black Friday momentum typically sustains demand slightly above the November baseline, though often lower than the peak promotional week itself.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for trainer socks (shaftless) is currently in its seasonal minimum during the winter months. Recent history shows a significant promotion-driven spike in Period 42 (354 units, likely Black Friday), followed by a severe post-promotion slump in Period 43 (143 units). This 143 is an outlier compared to the previous November baseline of ~234 units. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to recover slightly from the post-sale exhaustion towards the seasonal baseline, but remain low given the cold weather. I anticipate a return toward the ~200-220 range as the market stabilizes after the volatile 'spike-and-crash' seen in the last two weeks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for trainer socks reaches its seasonal minimum in winter. Recent data shows a significant spike in Period 42 (354 units) due to Black Friday, followed by a sharp post-sale crash in Period 43 (143 units). Period 44 (209 units) indicates a recovery toward the established November/December baseline of approximately 234 units. As Period 45 (Dec 16) is the final full week of holiday shopping, demand is expected to see a modest lift compared to the previous week, returning close to the seasonal baseline, although trainer socks are less popular than thermal socks in winter.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period (46) covers the week of Christmas 2019 (Dec 23 - Dec 29). For a non-seasonal product like trainer socks in winter, demand typically remains at its seasonal floor. Over the last three weeks (Periods 43-45), demand has averaged approximately 194 units, recovering from a post-Black Friday trough of 143 to 231 in Period 45. While Christmas week often sees high retail traffic early on, the actual demand for fine-knit trainer socks is expected to experience a slight pull-back or stagnation due to store closures on Dec 25-26 and the transition of consumer interest toward clearance or winter-appropriate gear. Given the slight upward trajectory from the previous two weeks (209 to 231), I forecast a stabilization around the 225 mark, reflecting the seasonal low and the holiday week impact.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 44-46) has stabilized at a low seasonal baseline of approximately 210-230 units, mirroring the long-term trend identified in Carry-Over Insights for the winter season (~234 units). While Period 42 showed a temporary spike (354) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, the subsequent weeks (143, 209, 231, 224) confirm that trainer socks are in a low-demand phase. For Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the end of the holiday season and entering the New Year period. There is typically no major seasonal driver for fine-knit trainer socks in mid-winter; however, post-Christmas clearance sales or returns-related activity can sometimes cause a minor uptick. Given the last three observations (231, 224, and the training data's recent 272), a slight regression toward the persistent winter floor is expected.
