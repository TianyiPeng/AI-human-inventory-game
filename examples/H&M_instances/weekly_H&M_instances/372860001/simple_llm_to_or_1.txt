======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 7-pack of basic cotton trainer socks, which are staple items with relatively stable demand. The historical demand data over the last 5 periods shows a range between 231 and 302, with a mean of 266.4. There is no clear linear trend, though there was a peak 3 periods ago followed by stabilization at 272. Given the date (February 11, 2019), we are in a mid-winter period where trainer socks (often worn with sneakers) might see slightly lower demand compared to spring, but as a basic multi-pack, demand remains consistent. The recent stability at 272 suggests a leveling off. I will forecast a value close to the recent average and the last observed data point, anticipating a slight seasonal maintenance as we move further into February.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for this SKU (Socks) shows a range of 231 to 302 with an average of 266.4. The most recent training data point was 272. In the first period of the test phase (2019-02-11), demand was 287 units, which is slightly above the historical average but within the established range. Given that the current date is mid-February (2019-02-18), we are in a stable period for basic hosiery (fine-knit trainer socks) before any significant spring seasonal surge. The trend from the end of the training set (272) to Period 1 (287) shows a moderate increase. I will forecast a slight continuation of this momentum while remaining within the upper bounds of historical performance.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for this SKU (Womens trainer socks) showed a baseline demand average of approximately 266 units. In the test phase, Period 1 started slightly above this average (287). Period 2 (2019/02/18) saw a significant surge to 548 units (+91% over Period 1), which likely corresponds to the lead-up to the transition into Spring fashion and potential promotional activity or seasonal stocking as weather warms. Period 3 (2019/02/25) is the final week of February. Typically, a sharp spike like the one seen in Period 2 is followed by a slight stabilization or partial retracement as initial 'new season' demand levels out, though it remains well above the winter baseline. I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly lower than the peak of Period 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (fine-knit trainer socks) showed a baseline around 230-300 units. In the recent test phase, demand spiked significantly in Period 2 (548) and remained elevated in Period 3 (399), suggesting a shift as we move into the spring season when trainer socks (low-cut) typically see increased demand. Period 2 likely contained a promotional event or early spring surge, while Period 3 shows a correction toward a new, higher seasonal baseline. For Period 4 (March 4th), I expect demand to stabilize between the recent high and the previous historical average as the spring transition continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: Baseline increased from ~260 to ~411 (+58%) over the last 3 periods, likely due to seasonal transition to spring footwear/socks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an average demand of 266 units. In the test phase, Period 1 started at 287, followed by a significant spike in Period 2 (548) and a subsequent cooling trend in Period 3 (399) and Period 4 (338). As noted in the carry-over insight, there was a regime shift in February (Periods 2-4) with an average of approximately 411 units, likely driven by the seasonal shift toward 'Fine-knit trainer socks' as spring approaches. Period 4 (338 units) shows a return toward a more sustainable baseline after the initial high-volume surge. For Period 5 (March 11), demand is expected to remain above the initial baseline but continue its stabilization trend as the initial 'spring transition' surge levels off.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal uptick as weather warms in March. Historical demand in the test phase showed a significant spike in Period 2 (548) but has since experienced a steady decline over the last three periods (399 -> 338 -> 252). The demand in Period 5 (252) has returned to the initial baseline levels seen in Period 1 (287) and the training data average (~266). The previously noted 'regime shift' in Period 4 appears to have been a temporary spike rather than a sustained plateau, as the last three periods show a downward trend (-15%, -25% respectively). For Period 6, I expect demand to stabilize around the long-term average/baseline, accounting for slight seasonal interest but respecting the recent deceleration.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed an average demand of 266. In the test phase, there was an initial spike in late February (Periods 2-3) reaching up to 548 units, which triggered a previous carry-over insight suggesting a regime shift. However, demand has since stabilized and slightly softened over the last three periods (Periods 4, 5, 6), averaging 306 units. The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is a staple item for spring. Given the current date (late March), we are entering a peak seasonal window for 'shaftless' socks as weather warms. The recent trend shows a bounce back from 252 (Period 5) to 329 (Period 6). My forecast anticipates a slight continuation of this recovery while acknowledging the volatile nature of the recent data, settling near the recent three-week average.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '7p Basic Shaftless' trainer socks shows signs of seasonal volatility as spring approaches. Historical training data showed a baseline around 266 units. In the recent test phase, demand spiked in Period 2 (548) but then corrected. The most recent three periods (P5-P7) show a clear upward recovery trend: 252 -> 329 -> 415. Period 7 (March 25th) hit 415 units, aligning with the start of warmer weather and increased interest in low-cut 'trainer socks'. Given the current date of April 1st, we are entering the peak spring shopping window. I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory from the previous period's 415.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a baseline around 266 units. During the test phase (Periods 1-8), the demand transitioned into a higher regime as spring approached, peaking early in Period 2 (548) before stabilizing. The most recent three periods (6, 7, and 8) show demands of 329, 415, and 382 respectively, resulting in a three-period moving average of 375 units. As of April 8 (Period 9), weather in many regions warms up, increasing demand for 'trainer socks' (fine-knit, shaftless) which are typically worn with low-cut spring/summer shoes. Given the steady demand above 300 in recent weeks and the seasonal alignment, I expect demand to remain robust around the 380 mark.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Post-February surge, demand has stabilized in a 330-415 range (Avg ~375) throughout March and early April, representing a ~40% increase over the initial training baseline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 266 units. In the test phase, we saw a surge in Period 2 (548) followed by a stabilization. Periods 4 through 9 show a demand range between 252 and 415. Specifically, the last four periods (6, 7, 8, and 9) have demands of 329, 415, 382, and 322, resulting in a recent four-week average of approximately 362 units. The current date is April 15, which is mid-spring. As 'fine-knit trainer socks' are highly seasonal for spring and summer, we expect the demand to remain elevated compared to the initial winter baseline but currently stabilized. Period 9 showed a slight decrease (322), and Period 5 also showed a dip (252), suggesting some volatility. Given the average of the last four periods is 362 and the average of the last two is 352, I will forecast a value near this stabilized mean.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a '7p Basic Shaftless' fine-knit trainer sock, which typically sees increased demand as weather warms and consumers shift to low-cut footwear. Historically, the demand moved from an initial baseline of ~260 to a higher regime (~370) during February and March. However, the most recent four periods (Periods 7-10) show a cooling trend: 415, 382, 322, 308. The average over the last two weeks is 315 units, indicating that the early spring surge may be stabilizing or slightly receding. Current date is April 22nd; while spring demand is still active, the immediate trend is downward. I expect demand to remain within the 300-320 range as it stabilizes before any potential May spikes.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (trainer socks) shows significant volatility but a generally higher baseline since the spring transition began in February. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has fluctuated between 308, 427, and today's task following a 427-unit peak. Period 11 (2019/4/22) saw a surge to 427 units, likely influenced by the Easter holiday proximity and warming spring weather. As we move into the end of April (Period 12: 2019/4/29), demand for trainer socks typically remains strong as consumers transition fully into spring/summer footwear. While Period 11 was high, the average over the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) is approximately 371 units. Given the recent spike, a slight regression toward the established 375-unit mean observed in recent 'Carry-over Insights' is expected, though the late-April timing maintains upward seasonal pressure.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (avg 266) was surpassed in the test phase as demand shifted into a higher regime. Analysis of the test phase shows two distinct clusters: Periods 1-10 (averaging ~358) and a recent surge in Periods 11-12 (averaging 432 units). The product, 'Fine-knit trainer socks', is highly seasonal for late spring/early summer. As we enter May (Period 13, 2019/5/6), we are approaching peak demand for trainer socks as weather warms. The recent jump from the ~310-320 range (Periods 9-10) to the ~430 range (Periods 11-12) suggests a sustained upward trend rather than a one-off spike. Given the momentum and seasonal timing, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or slightly increase.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring surge confirmed: Average demand transitioned from ~350 units (Mar/Apr) to ~430 units (+23%) starting in late April/early May (Period 11), aligning with peak seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during the transition into warmer weather (May-June). Historically, the demand showed a steady baseline around 375, then transitioned to a higher range ($420+) in late April (Periods 11 and 12). Period 13 (2019/05/06) showed a sharp drop to 267 units, which appears to be a transitory outlier or a 'dip' rather than a new sustained regime, possibly related to local holiday timing (Early May Bank Holiday in some markets) or a temporary stock-out effect. Looking at the trend since Period 11, the 'Late-spring surge' identified in Carry-over Insights (Avg ~430) is the more likely sustained level for mid-May compared to the singular anomalous drop in Period 13. I expect the demand to revert towards the recently established mean of ~430 units as the weather continues to warm.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant demand surge in late April (Periods 11-12, avg. 432), which was previously identified as a seasonal peak for trainer socks. However, the last two periods (P13: 267, P14: 275) show a sharp decline back to the baseline levels observed in February and early March (~270 range). This drop coincides with the post-May Day bank holiday period. Given that Period 15 (May 20) leads into the Spring Bank Holiday week, a slight recovery is expected compared to the previous two weeks as consumers prepare for the holiday, though demand is likely to remain below the late-April peak. I am forecasting a modest increase to 295, weighting the recent lower baseline more heavily than the temporary April surge.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows three distinct phases: an initial surge in Feb/Mar (avg ~375), a late-April peak (avg ~430), and a significant dip in mid-May (Periods 13-14) where demand dropped to sub-300 levels. Period 15 (2019/05/20) shows a recovery to 348 units. The current date (2019/05/27) corresponds to the lead-up to the UK Spring Bank Holiday and the start of warmer summer weather, which typically drives demand for 'fine-knit trainer socks'. Given the recovery in Period 15 and the seasonal relevance of the product in late May, I anticipate demand will continue to trend back toward the 350-400 range. I am forecasting a slight increase from Period 15 to account for the holiday period and seasonal alignment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (trainer socks) shows clear seasonality, peaking as weather warms. After a brief dip in mid-May (Periods 13-14), demand has entered a recovery phase: Period 15 (348) and Period 16 (370). The product is a seasonal 'Fine-knit trainer sock', which typically sees peak demand in late spring and early summer (June). The current date (June 3) represents the start of early summer. The trend over the last two periods shows a +6% to +20% increase. Given the upward trajectory and seasonal relevance, I expect demand to continue rising toward the late-spring baseline of ~430 established in Periods 11-12, though tempered by recent variability. A forecast in the 390-410 range accounts for this recovery.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (trainer socks) shows significant volatility but clear seasonal transitions. Initial training baseline was ~260. A spring surge occurred in February (avg ~411), followed by a stabilization in March/April (avg ~375). A late-spring peak was noted in Periods 11-12 (avg ~430), but demand has since corrected downward. Over the last five periods (13-17), demand has averaged approximately 311 units, which is notably lower than the late-spring peak but still above the initial early-year baseline. The current date (June 10) is mid-summer, where demand for trainer socks typically remains stable or slightly softens compared to the initial spring transition. Recent demand has been 348, 370, and 297. Given the drop in Period 17 and the lack of a sustained upward trend in the last 4 weeks, I expect demand to remain in the 300-330 range as it stabilizes for the summer season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (trainer socks) showed a significant late-spring peak (Periods 11-12) reaching ~430 units. However, demand has since cooled significantly throughout late May and June. Specifically, the last six periods (13-18) have averaged approximately 308 units, with the two most recent weeks showing notable stability at 297 and 294 units. This indicates a 'post-peak' stabilization phase where the early summer demand is lower than the initial spring surge. As the current date is mid-June, there is no immediate seasonal trigger to suggest a spike; instead, the data suggests a return to a baseline similar to the March/April period. I will forecast a continuation of this recent stable trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following the late-spring peak, demand has settled into a lower summer baseline period (Avg ~308 units over Periods 13-18), representing a ~28% decline from the peak observed in late April/early May.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the product (trainer socks) underwent a significant surge in late spring (Period 11-12, avg ~432) before settling into a lower early-summer baseline. Periods 13 to 19 show a mean demand of approximately 312 units. Recent performance (Periods 17-19) consists of 297, 294, and 334 units, averaging 308. As we enter late June (2019/6/24), the demand is relatively stable within this new regime. There is no immediate major holiday spike expected for this specific product category in this calendar window, and the recent slight uptick to 334 is within the current variance (range 267-370 in the summer plateau). Forecast logic assumes demand will remain near the recent three-period average while acknowledging the slight positive momentum from Period 19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which are highly seasonal and typically peak in spring and early summer. Historical data shows a clear peak in late April/early May (Periods 11-12) followed by a cooling period. Analysis of the most recent data (Periods 17-20) shows demand fluctuating between 289 and 334 units, with an average of 303.5. This aligns with the 'Demand stabilization' insight noted in Period 19, suggesting we have entered a mid-summer baseline. The latest observation (Period 20) was 289 units. Given the transition into July, demand is expected to remain stable within this established summer range (approx. 290-320). I will forecast a value near the recent average, accounting for the slight downward pressure seen in the most recent week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for trainer socks peaked in late April/early May (avg ~430) and has since stabilized into a summer baseline. Analyzing the most recent five periods (P17-P21), demand has fluctuated between 289 and 334, with a mean of 306.2 units. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 19, which identified a stabilization around ~308 units. As of July 8, the demand remains consistent with no significant seasonal spikes or retail events expected in this specific week. Given the recent average and the slight upward movement in the most recent observation (317), the forecast maintains the current steady-state logic.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring/early summer. Historical data shows a clear peak in late April/early May (Period 11-12 at ~430 units) followed by a stabilization to a summer baseline. Reviewing recent demand from Period 19 to 22 (334, 289, 317, 313), the average is 313 units. This confirms the 'Demand stabilization' insight from Period 19, where demand has settled significantly lower than the spring peak. The variance in the last four weeks is minimal (range of 289-334), suggesting a stable mid-summer demand regime. For Period 23 (July 15), there are no major retail holidays or seasonal shifts expected to disrupt this baseline. Therefore, the forecast remains aligned with the recent 4-week moving average of approximately 313 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a stabilization in demand following the late-spring peak. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has fluctuated between 289 and 352 units, with an average of approximately 321 units. This confirms the 'summer baseline' identified in previous insights. The most recent observation (Period 23: 352 units) shows a slight increase compared to the previous four weeks. Given that late July is peak summer season for trainer socks, demand is expected to remain firm within the established 310-350 range. The forecast for Period 24 assumes a continuation of this stable summer demand with a slight weighting toward the most recent uptick.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Fine-knit trainer sock' shows several seasonal shifts. After a late-spring peak (Periods 11-12), the demand entered a summer stabilization phase. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 19-24), the demand has fluctuated between 277 and 352 units, with an average of approximately 310 units. Specifically, the last four periods (21-24) show [317, 313, 352, 277], maintaining a relatively stable mean despite the slight dip in the most recent week. As we are in late July, we are still within the peak utility window for trainer socks (summer footwear), and there is no evidence of a pre-autumn decline yet. The forecast targets the established summer baseline mean (~310-315), adjusting slightly for the most recent observation's volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a peak for this trainer sock SKU in late April/early May (~430 units), followed by a lower summer baseline (Avg ~308 units). In the most recent four weeks (Periods 22-25), demand has begun to trend downwards: 313, 352, 277, 256. This decline aligns with the end of the peak summer retail season and the transition towards late summer/early autumn, where demand for 'trainer socks' often softens before a potential 'Back to School' or autumn baseline shift. Period 25 (256 units) is the lowest volume observed since early spring. Given the clear downward trajectory over the last two weeks and the seasonal context of early August, I expect demand to remain in this lower range, potentially stabilizing around the 250-260 unit mark.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer decline: Demand has shifted from a stable summer baseline (~308 units) to a lower late-summer range (Avg ~266 units over last 2 periods), marking a ~14% decline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for trainer socks has been trending downward from its late-spring peak (~430 units) and subsequent summer baseline (~308 units). Most recently, demand has stabilized at a lower level, with the last two periods recording 256 and 258 units respectively. This aligns with the 'Mid-summer decline' noted in the previous carry-over insights. As of mid-August (Period 27), demand appears to have found a new temporary floor around the 255-260 range. While 'Back-to-School' shopping often occurs in mid-to-late August, the current week-over-week evidence suggests stability at the current lower level rather than an immediate surge.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this '7p Basic Shaftless' trainer sock shows a distinct seasonal pattern. Peak demand occurred in late spring (Periods 11-12, late April) with demand exceeding 400 units, followed by a gradual stabilization through June and July around the 310-330 mark. The most recent 'Mid-summer decline' mentioned in Carry-over Insights saw demand drop to a range of 250-280 units (Periods 24-26). However, the most recent observation (Period 27: 301 units) shows a slight recovery. As we move into late August (Period 28, August 19th), we typically see a 'Back to School' lift for basic hosiery and socks. Given the recent uptick from 258 to 301, and the seasonal anticipation of late-August shopping, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly increase relative to the last few weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which are typically seasonal towards warmer weather but see a recovery in late August as 'Back to School' shopping and transitional autumn foot traffic begin. (1) Historical Context: Demand peaked in late spring (Periods 11-12) at ~430 units and declined through mid-summer to a low of ~256-258 units (Periods 25-26). (2) Recent Trend: The last three periods (26, 27, 28) show a recovery from the mid-summer low (258 -> 301 -> 294), establishing a new stabilized average around 284 units for August. (3) Calendar Logic: Current date is 2019/08/26, the final week of August. This period often coincides with the end of summer sales and the start of early autumn shopping, supporting a stabilization or slight uptick compared to the July/early August lows. (4) Forecast Logic: Given the stability between 294 and 301 over the last two weeks, I expect demand to remain within this stabilized range.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer stabilization: Demand has recovered from the mid-summer low of ~258 and stabilized at a new range of 290-305 units over the last 3 periods (26-28), representing a ~12% increase from the early August trough.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for the 7p Basic Shaftless trainer socks has shown significant volatility in late summer. While Periods 27 and 28 suggested a stabilization around the 300-unit mark, Period 29 (Aug 26) saw a sharp decline to 229 units (-22%). This drop aligns with the transition from peak summer seasonality toward early autumn (Sept 2), where demand for low-cut trainer socks typically begins to soften in favor of full-length socks or hosiery. Given the historical late-summer baseline of ~266 units and the recent dip, the forecast predicts a slight recovery from the Period 29 low but remains conservative, positioning demand within the lower range observed during previous late-summer transitions.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical performance of SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) shows distinct seasonal movements. After a late-August dip (Period 29: 229 units), demand recovered in Period 30 (274 units). Analysis of recent weeks (Periods 26-30) shows an average demand of 271 units. While Period 29 was an outlier, the broader trend is one of stabilization following the late-summer trough. The current date (Sept 9) marks the beginning of the 'Back to School' and early autumn transition; however, trainer socks are a low-cut style often replaced by fuller socks as weather cools, which typically prevents significant upward surges in autumn. Based on the most recent recovery and the average of the last 5 periods (271.2), I forecast Period 31 to remain stable around the current level.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU '372860001' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn cooling phase. Since the recovery noted in Periods 26-28 (average ~285), recent observations (Periods 29-31) show a sustained decline to an average of ~252 units. This aligns with the transition from low-cut 'trainer' socks to fuller coverage hosiery as temperatures drop in September. The last three periods recorded 229, 274, and 254 units. Given this downward pressure and the loss of the summer peak, a forecast near the recent median (254) and the training baseline (266) is appropriate. I expect the demand to remain stable or slightly decrease as the season shifts further into autumn.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition decline: Demand has shifted from the late-summer recovery (Avg ~285) to a lower autumn baseline (Avg ~252 over Periods 29-31), marking an approximate 12% decrease as seasonal relevance for trainer socks wanes.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is seasonally tied to warmer weather and low-profile footwear. Historically, the demand peaked in late spring (Period 12: 438 units) and has been on a gradual downward trajectory as the year progresses into autumn. (1) Historical pattern shows a clear seasonal decline from the early-summer peak (Avg ~350) to a summer baseline (~308) and then into a lower late-summer/autumn range. (2) Calendar analysis for late September (Period 33, Sept 23) indicates a continued shift toward cooler weather, reducing the demand for trainer socks in favor of full-length socks. (3) Recent trend analysis shows the last three periods (30, 31, 32) have been 274, 254, and 248 respectively, confirming a sustained lower baseline. (4) The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 251. Given the slight downward slope in the most recent two weeks (254, 248), I expect demand to remain stable or slightly lower at this new autumn floor.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a significant anomaly in Period 33 (405 units), jumping 63% from the previous four-period average of ~251 units. Historically, trainer socks are highly seasonal; previous insights (Period 32) indicated an autumn transition decline as colder weather reduces the relevance of 'shaftless' socks. However, Period 33's spike to levels near the spring peak (Period 12: 438) suggests either a one-off promotional event or a late-season 'Back to University/School' surge. Given that Period 34 (Sept 30) follows this spike, demand typically mean-reverts after such localized surges, though usually not back to the absolute trough immediately. I expect demand to soften from the 405 peak but remain elevated above the previous 250 baseline as the event/trend concludes, settling around the 320-330 range.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this SKU (trainer socks) shows a declining trend throughout the autumn as seasonal relevance for summer hosiery wanes. However, Period 33 exhibited a significant spike (405 units), followed by a correction to 312 units in Period 34. This suggests a temporary lift likely related to mid-season promotions or back-to-university shopping, rather than a permanent regime shift, as trainer socks typically lose demand moving into October. The average for the last two periods is 358, but the general trend prior to the spike was centered around 250. Given the date (Oct 7), I expect demand to continue its post-spike regression toward the autumn baseline, though remaining slightly elevated due to the residual momentum from the previous fortnight.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a reversion to the autumn baseline after a significant spike in Period 33 (405 units). In Periods 34 and 35, demand decreased from 312 to 266 units respectively. This decline indicates that the temporary driver of the Period 33 surge (likely a promotion) has dissipated. As of mid-October, the seasonal relevance for 'shaftless' trainer socks continues to wane. The demand is returning to the level established in Periods 29-32 (average ~252). Therefore, I forecast a continued settling into this baseline for Period 36.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is seasonally focused on spring/summer. Historical data shows demand peaked in April/May (~430 units) and has since trended downward as temperatures drop in autumn. Recent carry-over insights confirmed a regime shift to an 'Autumn baseline' of ~252 units. However, we saw a significant anomaly in Period 33 (405 units) which quickly corrected. Looking at the last four periods (P33-P36), demand has steadily declined from 405 to 312, then 266, and most recently 240 units. This decline reflects waning seasonal relevance for trainer socks in late October. The last two periods (266, 240) average 253 units, aligning closely with the established autumn baseline. Given the most recent figure of 240 and the continuing downward seasonal trend, I forecast demand to remain in the low 240-250 range.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for SKU 372860 (fine-knit trainer socks) shows clear seasonal behavior. Previous carry-over insights identified a decline into an autumn baseline (Avg ~252) as 'seasonal relevance for trainer socks wanes'. Recent data (Periods 32-37) shows some volatility: a sharp spike in Period 33 (405) followed by a return to lower levels (312, 266, 240, 306). Calculating the average demand over the last four weeks (Periods 34-37) yields ~281 units, which is slightly higher than the Period 32 baseline but significantly lower than the spring/summer peak. Given that late October (Period 38) typically sees a shift towards full-length socks rather than trainer socks, and the recent trend has been fluctuating within the 240-310 range, a forecast near the recent average is appropriate. Period 37 showed a slight rebound to 306, but the overall trajectory remains lower than warmer months.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring/late spring and lower demand during colder autumn/winter months. Recent demand (Periods 35-38) has fluctuated between 240 and 306 units, averaging 272 units. While Period 33 saw a significant outlier/spike (405), the subsequent periods indicate a return to a lower baseline consistent with previous Carry-over Insights for the autumn transition. The most recent observations (306, 276) suggest a slight softening but stability around the current 270-280 level as we enter November. Given the historical average of the last 4 periods and the general late-autumn seasonality for low-cut trainer socks, I expect demand to remain in this established range.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for trainer socks has entered its low-season autumn/winter regime. Over the last six periods (34-39), demand has fluctuated between 240 and 312 units, with a six-week average of 273.5 units. The most recent observation (Period 39) was 241 units. Although the current date (Nov 11) is associated with promotional events like Singles' Day, trainer socks typically do not show major seasonal spikes in winter compared to footwear or warmer apparel. Therefore, the forecast assumes a continuation of the current low-season baseline, slightly regressing toward the recent six-week average while acknowledging the downward pressure of early November.

Carry-over insight: Low-season stabilization: Demand has maintained a consistent baseline (Avg ~273 units) over the last 6 periods (34-39), representing a stable transition into the autumn/winter period for trainer socks after the September peaks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring/summer and lower demand in late autumn/winter. Historical data from the last 7 periods (Period 34 to 40) shows a stable low-season baseline with an average demand of approximately 270 units. The most recent three periods (38, 39, 40) have recorded demands of 276, 241, and 252, indicating a minor downward drift or stabilization near the lower end of the recent range. As we enter late November (Period 41: 2019/11/18), there is no significant calendar signal for trainer socks to spike; if anything, the cold weather maintains the trend of low seasonal relevance. The forecast weights the recent 3-period average (approx. 256) and the 7-period baseline (270) to arrive at a predicted value that reflects the current stable, low-demand environment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this SKU (trainer socks) shows a general decline in demand as the weather turns colder, moving away from its peak seasonality (Spring/Summer). Over the last 6 periods (Period 36-41), demand has averaged approximately 254 units. More specifically, the last three periods (Period 39: 241, Period 40: 252, Period 41: 210) indicate a downward pressure as we enter late November. The current date is Nov 25th, which is Black Friday week. While socks are often bought as gifts, 'trainer socks' specifically are less seasonally relevant in winter than heavier socks. However, a site-wide promotional lift for Black Friday is expected. Period 41 saw a sharp drop to 210 units, possibly due to customers delaying purchases until the sale week. I expect a recovery from the Period 41 low due to promotional activity, but constrained by the low seasonal relevance, aiming slightly above the recent 6-week average.

Recent periods (41 and 42) showed a significant dip (210) followed by a sharp spike (354) corresponding to the Black Friday period. Period 43 (Dec 2) coincides with Cyber Monday and the start of the December holiday shopping season. While trainer socks are in their seasonal low period due to colder weather, promotional activities and holiday gift-giving typically sustain higher-than-average volume for basics. I expect demand to remain elevated relative to the November baseline due to Cyber Monday momentum, though slightly lower than the primary Black Friday peak observed in Period 42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows this product is in its low-season baseline (typically ~270 units) during the autumn/winter months. Recent demand has been highly volatile due to calendar events: Period 42 saw a significant spike (354 units) corresponding with Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions, followed by a sharp 'post-sale' correction in Period 43 (143 units). For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to recover from the post-promotion trough and regress toward the established low-season baseline. While trainer socks are less seasonally relevant in winter, they remain a basic staple. I predict a return to a level near the recent pre-spike period (Period 41: 210 units) but slightly higher as holiday shopping picks up, targeting approximately 238 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees lower demand during the winter months. Historical data and Carry-Over Insights establish a 'low-season stabilization' around ~273 units in October and November. However, recent periods show higher volatility and a downward trend: Period 41 (210), Period 42 (354 - likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday outlier), and Period 43 (143 - a significant post-promotion drop). Period 44 recovered slightly to 209 units. As we enter the week of December 16th (Period 45), we are approaching the peak of holiday gift shopping, but trainer socks are less seasonal for winter weather compared to thermal socks. Given the average of the last 4 periods (excluding the outlier) is approximately 187, and the most recent demand was 209, I expect demand to remain in this lower winter baseline while possibly seeing a minor pre-holiday bump.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility: Demand transitioned from a stable 270 baseline to a more volatile winter regime (Avg ~229 over Periods 41-44), influenced by promotional spikes (Period 42) and subsequent steep corrections.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7p Basic Shaftless' trainer socks, which are highly seasonal towards spring/summer. Currently, Period 46 (week of 2019-12-23) represents the peak of the winter holiday season. Historically, demand for trainer socks reaches its nadir in winter, though basic items often see a minor lift during Christmas week as 'stocking stuffers' or essentials. (1) Historical pattern: Demand dropped from a summer high (~350-400) to an autumn/winter baseline of approximately 230-270. (2) Recent Trend: After the Black Friday spike (P42: 354) and subsequent crash (P43: 143), demand has been recovering steadily: 209 in P44 and 231 in P45 (+10.5%). (3) Current Period: The week of Dec 23 involves Christmas Day. While retail traffic is high, trainer socks are not primary gifting items, suggesting demand will likely follow the recent recovery trend and stabilize near the late-autumn baseline rather than spike significantly. Predicted demand reflects the continued minor upward momentum from P45.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has shown a strong seasonal decline since the late-spring peak. Historically, demand has transitioned from a stable autumn baseline (avg ~273) to a lower, more volatile winter regime (avg ~229 since Period 41). The current date is Dec 30, falling in the post-Christmas/New Year's week. Recent observations for December (Periods 43-46) show demand of 143, 209, 231, and 224. The last two periods (231 and 224) suggest a temporary stabilization. Given the calendar timing (post-holiday lull and mid-winter low for trainer socks), demand is expected to remain near the recent average of these stabilization points (~227). No significant new regime shift is confirmed over a 3-period window to warrant a new carry-over insight.
