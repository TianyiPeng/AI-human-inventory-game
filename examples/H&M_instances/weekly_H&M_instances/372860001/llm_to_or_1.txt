Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a pack of fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows a stable range [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] with a mean of 266.4. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since we have no prior period conclusions yet, we will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent level. This will set a base stock level to cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR engine will use these to calculate the order to satisfy demand while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is women's socks, which typically show stable demand but are currently out of stock. In Period 1, we ordered 310 units and observed a demand of 287. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (visible in Period 4 START). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 310 units in transit. Historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] plus the recent Period 1 demand of 287 suggests a relatively stable regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand average while maintaining the default promised lead time (L=2). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 periods was [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], averaging 266.4. However, Period 1 and 2 demand spiked significantly to 287 and 548 respectively. The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', which likely sees increased demand as weather warms or during specific February promotions. The observed lead time for the Period 1 order was 1 period (arrived in Period 2), which is faster than the promised 2 periods. However, the current inventory is 0 on-hand with 307 in-transit (ordered Period 2). Given the extreme demand spike in Period 2 (548), I will set mu_hat to reflect a higher recent average to prevent stockouts, though I suspect Period 2 might be an outlier. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the upward trend without overreacting to the single 548 spike. L is set to default (2) to be conservative, despite the 1-period arrival observation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Socks) is experiencing high demand (avg: 411 over last 3 periods) compared to initial historical samples (avg: 266). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand in Periods 1-3 significantly exceeded arrivals. Lead time analysis: Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived in 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2 periods. In Period 3, 625 units were ordered and are currently in-transit. I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the observed 1-period lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (287, 548, 399). Given the high volatility (std \u2248 130), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~266 to ~411 (+54%) over the last 3 periods. Actual lead time confirmed as 1 period (observed in Period 1 and Period 2 orders).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Socks) is currently facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods has been [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (historical) and [287, 548, 399, 338] (current game), showing a significant upward shift compared to initial seeds. The mean demand of the last 4 game periods is ~393. Evidence from Period 2 and 3 conclude messages confirms the actual lead time is 1 period (L=1), not the promised 2. However, the order from Period 3 (625 units) failed to arrive in Period 4 (expected if L=1), resulting in 0 units arriving and 0 sales. Since the Period 3 order is still 'In-transit', I must assume L=1 remains the typical speed but account for the potential delay or loss. I will set L=1 explicitly to align with observed speed and use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher game-period volume. High sigma is maintained via recent_N to account for the high variance (e.g., the 548 spike).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 1 period (orders from P1 and P2). Possible delivery delay/anomaly noted in Period 4 (P3 order did not arrive). Demand regime stabilized at a higher mean of ~393 units vs historical ~266.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), we observe the conclusion of Period 5. The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', a staple item. Demand history [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287, 548, 399, 338, 252] shows a significant spike in Periods 2-4 (avg ~428) which has since moderated in Period 5 (252). Lead time analysis: P1 arrived in 1 period, P2 arrived in 1 period, but P3 arrived in 2 periods (P5 conclude). P4 (354 units) is currently in-transit; if lead time is 2, it should arrive in Period 6. The current on-hand (373) and in-transit (354) total 727 units. Given the moderation in demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (avg ~365) to account for the recent higher-than-baseline activity while acknowledging the P5 dip. I will set L to 2 to align with the promised lead time and the most recent delivery (P3).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is variable between 1 and 2 periods (P1/P2 were 1, P3 was 2). Demand spike observed Periods 2-4 has regressed to 252 in Period 5, suggesting the high-demand regime may be ending.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the context is Women's trainer socks in late March. Historical demand shows a spike in Periods 2-4 (avg ~428) which has since cooled down in Periods 5-6 (avg ~290). The overall mean of all 6 samples is 358.8. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Observations show actual lead times of 1, 1, and 2 periods (P1, P2, P3 orders respectively). The P4 order (354 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) but hasn't arrived in the P6 conclude message, meaning it should arrive during P7. The P6 order (538 units) is also in transit. Current on-hand is low (44). Given the demand regression from the early spike, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the stabilization while acknowledging the earlier volatility. L will be set to the promised 'default' of 2, as recent shipments (P3) and pending ones (P4) suggest the 1-period arrival was an early anomaly or 'best case'.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike (P2-P4) has subsided; demand has stabilized around ~290-330 units over the last 2 periods (P5-P6). Lead time is confirmed to be at least 2 periods for the P3 order, reverting from the initial 1-period arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 372860001 is currently out of stock (ending inventory 0) due to a demand spike in Period 7 (415 units) which exceeded the starting inventory. Reviewing the lead time history: P1 and P2 arrived in 1 period, while P3 arrived in 2 periods. The orders from P4 (354 units), P6 (538 units), and P7 (346 units) are currently in-transit (total 1238). The P4 order is now significantly overdue (placed P4, now P8 START), suggesting it may be lost. The promised lead time is 2, and given the inconsistency (1-2 periods), setting L to the promised 2 is prudent. Demand history shows a volatile pattern: [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (pre-game) and [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415] (in-game). The recent mean (last 5 periods) is approximately 346. Since P4 is likely lost, the 'in-transit' count known by the OR backend (1238) is inflated. To compensate for the lost P4 order (354 units) and ensure the base stock calculation triggers a sufficient order to cover the current stockout, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand mean, and default L=2.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 4 (354 units) is likely lost (exceeded promised lead time of 2 by 2 additional periods without concluding). Demand remains volatile with a higher mean of ~346 units over the last 5 periods compared to the initial ~266.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), we observe that the order from Period 4 (354 units) is effectively lost, as it is now 5 periods since the order was placed (promised lead time 2). This unit count remains in the 'In-transit' field but will not arrive, which might cause the OR backend to under-order if it thinks the pipeline is full. The 'In-transit' total is 354, which exactly matches this lost shipment. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat or set parameters that force an order despite this ghost inventory. Recent demand (P6-P8) has averaged 375 units (329, 415, 382), which is higher than the long-term average. Lead times have been volatile (1 or 2 periods). I will set L to 2 (promised/recent max) and mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the recent higher demand regime (~375 units/period). By setting L=2, mu_hat will represent (1+L)*375 = 1125. This should trigger an order to cover the demand while the system ignores the stagnant 354 'in-transit' units as much as the capping logic allows.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 4 (354 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Recent demand regime (P6-P8) stabilized at a higher mean of ~375 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in Period 10 (mid-April). Demand history shows a shift from an initial mean of ~266 to a higher recent mean. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has been [252, 329, 415, 382, 322], averaging 340 units. The Period 4 order (354 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 6 periods since it was placed with no arrival. Lead times are volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P6 arrived in 2, P7 arrived in 1). I will set L to the promised 2 periods to be conservative. mu_hat will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the sustained higher demand regime (~340/period), resulting in (1+2)*340 = 1020. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for trainer socks is entering a spring peak. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), mean demand has been approximately 351 units, which is higher than the long-term average. The shipment from Period 4 (354 units) is officially considered lost as it is now 7 periods overdue. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P6 order took 2, P7 order took 1). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 10. To recover, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~351/period). Given the 2-period promised lead time, mu_hat should reflect demand over 3 periods (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average of observed actual lead times, which accounts for the variability between 1 and 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level of ~350 units over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). Shipment from Period 4 (354 units) is confirmed lost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is basic trainer socks. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The order from Period 4 (354 units) is confirmed lost, and the order from Period 10 (243 units) is in-transit. Based on the lead time history (P1: 1, P2: 1, P3: 2, P6: 2, P7: 1, P9: 2), the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods, with the promised 2 periods being a safe upper bound. The demand regime has shifted upwards since the initial periods. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), demand has been [415, 382, 322, 308, 427], yielding a mean of 370.8. I will use N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand level and volatility while ignoring the older, lower demand data. Since we are frequently stocking out, providing the OR backend with a recent, higher demand mean will help increase the base stock and safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for the period range P7-P11 is ~371, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~266. Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is women's trainer socks. Analysis of recent demand (P7-P12) shows a sustained high-demand regime with a mean of ~382 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~266. The last two periods (P11-P12) saw spikes above 425 units, suggesting a potential early summer seasonal lift as the weather warms. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand), and the shipment from Period 4 (354 units) is confirmed lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8 saw a 1-period arrival, while P11 saw a 2-period arrival). Given the current stockout and high demand, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods to be conservative. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~382) while incorporating the most recent spikes to ensure the base stock is sufficient to recover from the stockout. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated at ~382 units (P7-P12), with recent spikes >425 units suggesting seasonal summer growth for trainer socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences rising demand as the weather warms (approaching summer). Historically, demand spiked in Period 11 and 12 (427, 438 units) before dipping to 267 in Period 13. However, looking at the regime from Period 8-13, the average demand is approximately 357. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to lead time gaps. Orders from Period 10 (243 units), Period 12 (460 units), and Period 13 (170 units) are currently in-transit. The order from Period 10 is now 'overdue' if we assume a lead time of 2, but given the variability (L=1 or L=2), it is expected to arrive this period. To handle the seasonal increase and recent volatility, I will use a recent demand window (N=6) to capture the higher mean (~357) compared to the long-term average. I will set L to 'default' (2) as the backend uses the promised lead time for base stock calculation, which aligns with recent arrivals. Sigma will be calculated using the recent N to account for the increased variance during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed for Period 8-13: mean demand increased to ~357 units. Trainer socks seasonality is evident as we approach summer months.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date is 2019/05/20 (late Spring). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', which is highly seasonal, peaking in late Spring and Summer. Historically, we saw a demand surge in April (P7-P11) averaging ~371 units, followed by a slight dip in the last two periods (P13-P14) averaging ~271 units. However, looking at the full range P6-P14, the mean is approximately 352 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~266. Lead times have mostly stabilized at the promised 2 periods (P9, P12, P13 all arrived/are arriving at L=2), though some P4 units were lost earlier. Given the product type and the date (approaching peak summer demand), I expect demand to remain elevated despite the recent 2-week dip. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals align with promised lead time. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the higher seasonal regime since Period 6 (mean ~352), which results in a forecast of (1+2)*352 = 1056. I will use recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The SKU is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', which exhibits seasonal demand growth as summer approaches. Period 15 conclude shows we ran out of stock (Ending Inventory 0) because demand (348) exceeded on-hand inventory (185). The shipment from Period 13 (170 units) is expected to arrive this period (P16) given the 2-period promised lead time, but we are currently at 0 on-hand. In-transit inventory (965 units) includes the lost Period 4 order (354 units), meaning the true pipeline is 611 units (P13: 170, P15: 198, P16: 243-expected). Recent demand (P11-P15) shows a mean of approximately 351 units. Given the transition into June (peak season for trainer socks), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this elevated demand regime and using the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the OR engine to account for the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime for late spring (P11-P15) mean is ~351 units (+32% vs baseline). Seasonality for trainer socks is trending upward into summer.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd, the start of summer, which is peak season for trainer socks. Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 340 units, despite significant stockouts due to failed deliveries. Analysis of the 'In-transit' balance (965 units) vs. history confirms that the orders from Period 4 (354), Period 10 (243), and likely Period 13 (170) are lost or permanently delayed, totaling 767 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 965 'pipeline' from the base stock calculation, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these ghost units. For L=2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand. At an estimated 370 units/period (accounting for seasonality), the target base stock should be 1,110. To force the OR engine to ignore the 767 lost units, we set mu_hat = 1,110 (target) + 767 (lost) = 1,877. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the current stockout and expected summer demand despite the inflated pipeline figure.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P10 (243 units) and P13 (170 units) are now confirmed as highly likely lost, joining the previously lost P4 order (354 units). Total lost pipeline inventory is 767 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has clear summer seasonality. Recent demand (P11-P17) shows a mean of approximately 346 units, though we've had significant stockouts. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and while in-transit is 1692, a large portion (767 units from P4, P10, and P13) is confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. Specifically, the P4 order (354) is months overdue, P10 (243) is 8 periods overdue, and P13 (170) is 5 periods overdue. To compensate for this 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its calculations, I am setting an 'explicit' L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR engine doesn't under-order due to late historical arrivals. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current summer demand regime (avg ~346) and sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This approach aims to restore service levels as we enter the peak summer season while acknowledging the supply chain unreliability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are entering the peak summer season for 'fine-knit trainer socks', a highly seasonal product. Recent demand (P14-P18) has averaged approximately 317 units, but the broader late-spring/summer trend (P11-P18) shows a mean of 339 units. Given the seasonality, demand is expected to remain elevated or increase further. The pipeline inventory is currently 965 units, but history shows significant reliability issues: orders from P4 (354 units), P10 (243 units), and P13 (170 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 767 'ghost' units in the pipeline. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these phantom units, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the current seasonal regime (mean ~318 per period). I am choosing N=6 to cover the period since mid-May, providing a stable yet current estimate. The L parameter is set to 'calculate' to reflect the fluctuating 1-2 period actual lead time observed in recent successful arrivals (P17 arrived in 1 period, P12 arrived in 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed for Period 13 (170 units), adding to previously lost P4 and P10. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 767. Demand remains in summer regime with a mean of ~320-340 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for fine-knit trainer socks remains in a summer regime. Recent demand (P14-P19) shows a mean of 318 units. However, the system's pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P4 (354), P10 (243), P13 (170), and now P15 (198) are lost, totaling 965 units in the 'In-transit' bucket that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the pipeline value (965 units) plus on-hand (99 units). I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1100 to target an inventory position that covers the current demand level (~320/period) over the next 3 periods (L+1) while negating the 965 lost units. This forces the OR engine to recognize the need for physical stock despite the incorrect pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 15 (198 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline is now 965 (P4, P10, P13, P15).

As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in the peak summer season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1055 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 4 (354), Period 10 (243), Period 13 (170), and Period 15 (198), totaling 965 lost units. The only valid pipeline inventory is the 90 units ordered in Period 20. Therefore, the true pipeline is 90 units, not 1055. Historical demand analysis shows the summer regime (P16-P20) has a mean of approximately 317 units. To correct for the OR engine's inability to see lost orders, I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L=2 (promised) to be safe, though 1-period arrivals occur. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 317 = 951. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 1055 'In-transit' from the base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is actually placed. Effective Base Stock needs to cover (L+1) periods + the phantom inventory. Target Base Stock \u2248 951 + 965 = 1916. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1916 and sigma_hat to 120 (reflecting recent volatility) to trigger a replenishment order that overcomes the 'lost' units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 965 units are confirmed lost (P4: 354, P10: 243, P13: 170, P15: 198). Current 'In-transit' of 1055 includes only 90 valid units. Demand regime (P16-P20) mean is ~317 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/8. Demand for the recent regime (P16-P21) has a mean of approximately 317 units. The SKU (trainer socks) is in peak summer seasonality. The 'In-transit' figure of 1808 units is misleading due to substantial lost shipments: P4 (354), P10 (243), P13 (170), and P15 (198), totaling 965 lost units. Additionally, the order from P20 (90 units) is now 2 periods old and hasn't arrived, and the large order from P21 (753 units) is in its first period of transit. To fix the OR backend's overestimation of pipeline inventory (which causes it to under-order), I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I set L=4 to effectively 'stretch' the required base stock, forcing the backend to account for the fact that a large portion of the pipeline is non-existent. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*320 \u2248 1600. This ensures the system maintains enough pressure to replenish the current zero on-hand state despite the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 965 units are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P13, P15). P20 (90 units) is reaching the promised lead time limit. Seasonal demand for trainer socks remains stable around 315-325 units throughout July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-July (Period 23). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has shown a stable summer demand regime. Recent demands (P19-P22) are [334, 289, 317, 313], averaging ~313 units. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 1718 units. However, following the 'Carry-over Insights', we must subtract confirmed lost orders: P4 (354), P10 (243), P13 (170), and P15 (198), totaling 965 units. Additionally, the order from P17 (727 units) arrived in P18 and is no longer in transit. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 likely contains these 965 lost units + the P21 order (753 units). Effective pipeline is therefore ~753 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to be conservative given historical variability (1-2 periods). Mu_hat is set to 945 (315 average * 3 periods) to reflect the recent stable demand regime (N=5: P18-P22). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 24 (July 22, 2019). The product is trainer socks, which are in their peak summer demand regime. Historical demand over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) has averaged 321.75 units. The primary operational challenge is the high number of lost shipments: Period 4 (354), Period 10 (243), Period 13 (170), and Period 15 (198) are confirmed lost, totaling 965 units that incorrectly inflate the 'In-transit' figure of 1718. The remaining valid pipeline is 753 units (ordered in Period 21). Lead time for valid arrivals (P20, P17, P12) has stabilized at 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the valid pipeline of 753 is roughly 2.3 periods of demand and the next arrival (P21) is due in the upcoming arrival phase, I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand using the recent 8-period mean to maintain service levels while accounting for the phantom inventory in the OR backend's calculation.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (late July), we are managing trainer socks, which exhibit stable summer demand. Analyzing the history, demand from P19 to P24 shows a mean of approximately 307 units (334, 289, 317, 313, 352, 277). In-transit inventory is currently 1718 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, 965 units (P4, P10, P13, P15) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P21 (753 units) has now reached the 4-period mark (ordered P21, currently P25) without arriving. Given the promised lead time is 2, and previous reliable arrivals took 1-2 periods, a 4-period delay strongly suggests P21 is also lost. Total lost pipeline = 965 + 753 = 1718 units. This means the 'In-transit' of 1718 is comprised entirely of ghost inventory. Effective pipeline is 0. With On-hand at 0 and Effective Pipeline at 0, the OR backend must place a significant order to cover the (L+1) period demand. I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised lead time of 2, 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current stable demand level (~307 units), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: Order from Period 21 (753 units) is confirmed lost (4 periods elapsed without arrival), bringing total confirmed lost pipeline to 1718 units (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21). Effective pipeline inventory is currently 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 26 (August 5). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', which is a high-summer seasonal item. Historical demand analysis shows a steady regime with a mean of ~303 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). However, we are facing a critical inventory stockout. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. No orders have been placed since Period 21. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 28. To restore service levels and capture remaining summer demand, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (approx 303), mu_hat is set to 910. sigma_hat is set based on the last 5 periods to account for recent volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place a substantial order to refill the empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is 0; all 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21). Demand mean for the most recent 5-period window (P21-P25) is 302.8 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is critical due to severe pipeline losses. As of Period 27, the 'In-transit' inventory of 1718 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 13, 15, and 21). On-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it perceives the 1718 units as valid incoming stock and will not place new orders unless the base_stock exceeds this value. To force the OR backend to order, I must set 'mu_hat' (base stock) high enough to overcome this 'phantom' inventory. Recent demand (P21-P26) has averaged ~278 units, a slight decrease from the summer peak, likely due to the transition out of peak summer season (August). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to 2800 units to clear the 1718 lost units and provide approximately 1000 units of actual coverage (covering L+1 periods of demand). L is set to 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P17, P20) adhered to 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect recent volatility and ensure a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for Period 21-26 has moderated to ~278 units per period as the high summer season begins to taper. Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory remains 1718 units (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, P21).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (August 19), we are transitioning from high summer into the late-summer period for trainer socks. Demand over the last 7 periods (P21-P27) has stabilized at a mean of ~296 units, showing a slight decrease from the summer peak but remaining higher than the spring baseline. The 'In-transit' total is 2794 units, but carry-over insights reveal that 1718 units (from orders P4, P10, P13, P15, P21) are confirmed lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 1076 units (ordered in P27). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods, the P27 order is expected to arrive during P28 or P29. To ensure the backend places an appropriate order to cover the (L+1) window despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. This value is calculated as (1+L) * Forecast, where L=2 and Forecast=300, plus an adjustment to offset the 1718 phantom units in the pipeline that the OR backend incorrectly sees as valid. This prevents the OR engine from under-ordering due to lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for Period 21-27 is 296 units, confirming a post-peak summer stabilization. Effective pipeline inventory is 1076 units; total confirmed lost units remain 1718.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29 (late August), the product (trainer socks) is transitioning from its peak summer demand regime to a more stable late-summer level. The mean demand over the last 8 periods (P21-P28) is approximately 296 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 2794 is deceptive due to significant lost shipments. Based on historical data, orders from P4 (354), P10 (243), P13 (170), P15 (198), and P21 (753) are confirmed lost (total 1718 units), as they have far exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods. The effective pipeline consists only of the order from P27 (1076 units), which is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 28 or 29. Since it hasn't concluded by P28, it should arrive now. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current demand stabilization around ~296 units per period. The L parameter is set to 'default' (2) to maintain the safety buffer, as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for trainer socks is entering a post-summer cooling phase. Demand in Period 29 was 229, the lowest in recent history. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is ~267.6 units, compared to the summer peak (P11-P15) of ~351 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 847 units following the arrival of the P27 order. Regarding the pipeline, I have confirmed that 1,718 units are lost (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, and P21). These lost units artificially inflate the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. To compensate and ensure the engine places orders despite this phantom inventory, I am setting 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value. My target base stock is (L+1) * forecasted_demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and forecasted demand ~260, I need a pipeline + on-hand total of approx 780-850. Since the OR backend sees 847 (on-hand) + 1718 (phantom in-transit) = 2565 units, it will not order unless I provide an explicit mu_hat that forces the base stock above this phantom level. However, given the current high on-hand (847) and the downward demand trend, no immediate order is required this period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat to reflect the cooling trend while acknowledging the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~267 units (P25-P29) from summer mean of ~350 units. Total confirmed lost pipeline remains 1718 units (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are transitioning out of the high-demand summer season for trainer socks. Demand has cooled significantly from the summer peaks (>350) to a more stable post-peak average. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 271.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 573 units. Regarding the 'In-transit' quantity of 1718 units, historical evidence (detailed in Carry-over Insights) confirms these orders (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21) are lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods by a significant margin. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. The OR backend needs to recognize this deficit to ensure we cover the next 3 periods of demand (L+1). I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (recent_N=5), and sigma_hat based on the same window to reflect the reduced post-summer volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/09/16), we are entering the post-summer/autumn season for trainer socks. Demand has clearly cooled from the summer peak (mean ~350) to a more stable baseline. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 270 units. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1718 units is confirmed as lost (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, and P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is 319 units with no valid stock in the pipeline. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). 3 periods of demand at ~270 units/period equals ~810 units. Since on-hand is only 319, an order is necessary to prevent a stockout in 2 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this post-summer cooling (mean ~270) and using explicit L=2 to reflect the promised lead time, as recent arrivals (P27 order) followed the 2-period schedule.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: mean demand for P27-P31 is ~270 units. Effective pipeline inventory is zero; 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23. Demand has clearly shifted into a post-summer cooling regime. For the period P29-P32, demand has averaged 251.25 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak (avg ~350). On-hand inventory is 71 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21) as documented in carry-over insights. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. With L=2, we must cover 3 periods of demand (P33, P34, P35). To avoid stockouts in this new regime while minimizing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P27-P32) to capture the cooling trend (avg ~267). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will see 1718 in transit; however, since these are lost, the base stock needs to be high enough to trigger a new order that ignores the ghost inventory. I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the stabilized post-summer demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sept 30), we are entering the post-summer/autumn season for trainer socks. Demand has generally moderated from the summer peak (averaging ~267 in P25-P29) but spiked significantly to 405 in Period 33. This spike might be an outlier or early-autumn volatility, so I will use a balanced lookback window (recent_N=7) to capture the trend without over-reacting to one data point. Current on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21) and provides zero effective pipeline. The OR backend needs to place an order to replenish stock. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as it remains the baseline despite historical variance. Setting L to explicit=2 ensures the OR backend recognizes the 2-period gap plus the current decision period for a total coverage of 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization at ~270 units interrupted by a high-volatility spike (405 units) in P33. Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory remains 1718 units (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, P21).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, and P21), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Recent demand has stabilized following the summer peak; despite a volatility spike in Period 33 (405 units), the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 299 units. As we move into October, demand for trainer socks typically moderates further. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-summer mean (~299) while using recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for the recent high-volatility spike (P33). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 1-2 period delivery window, which allows the OR backend to set a base stock sufficient to cover the gap while effectively ignoring the phantom 'lost' inventory via the capping mechanism.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for P30-P34 is 298.6 units, confirming a stabilization after the summer peak, despite high volatility (P33: 405). Effective pipeline remains zero as 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), we are in a post-summer demand phase for trainer socks. Demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has averaged 297 units, though this includes a high-volatility spike of 405 units in P33. Without that spike, the mean is approximately 270 units. Inventory is currently 0, and the 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, and P21 have all exceeded any reasonable lead time window). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, so it will see 1718 units and likely order nothing unless I adjust parameters. However, I cannot manually zero out the pipeline in the backend. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P31-P35) to capture the current post-summer stabilization (Mean ~297). Given the inventory is exhausted and the pipeline is 'clogged' with lost units, the priority is to re-establish stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at a high enough level to force an order despite the phantom pipeline, or use 'recent_N' to reflect the actual demand regime. Note: if the OR engine's 'cap' or 'base_stock' logic prevents ordering due to the 1718 'In-transit' units, manual intervention via 'explicit' values is the only lever. I'll set mu_hat to 1200 (approx 4 periods of demand) to attempt to clear the pipeline gap.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), the demand for trainer socks has transitioned into a post-summer cooling phase. The mean demand for the most recent 5-period window (P32-P36) is 296.2 units, though it has been trending lower recently (P35: 266, P36: 240). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the 'In-transit' count of 1718 units consists entirely of orders confirmed lost (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since the OR backend uses pipeline inventory to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - pipeline), and it doesn't know these units are lost, I must set parameters to force an order. To account for the cooling demand and ensure a high service level while minimizing holding costs, I will use an explicit L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the recent 5-period mean (approx 296 units/period). This results in mu_hat = (1+2) * 296 = 888. However, because the backend subtracts the 1718 'phantom' units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to overcome this deficit. To order enough to cover approximately 3 periods of demand (~888 units) despite the 1718-unit subtraction, I will set mu_hat to 888 + 1718 = 2606. This ensures the backend places a corrective order to restore physical inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand cooling: Oct demand (P35-P36) mean is 253 units, down from summer levels (~350). Effective pipeline is zero; 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for Period 37 was 306 units, showing a slight increase from the mid-October lows (avg ~253). Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), demand averaged 305.8 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 63). The 'In-transit' figure of 2699 is highly inflated by lost shipments. Confirmed lost units: P4 (354), P10 (243), P13 (170), P15 (198), P21 (753), totaling 1718 units. The order from P27 (1076) arrived in P29. Thus, effective pipeline inventory is only the P37 order of 981 units. Current on-hand is 0. Since the backend capped policy and base-stock calculation are influenced by the (L+1) demand window and the total 'In-transit' (including lost units), I must use the 'explicit' method for L to account for the reliability issues and 'explicit' for mu_hat/sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the upcoming late autumn demand (mean ~280-300) while ignoring the 1718 'ghost' units in the pipeline. I set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period mean (305.8) multiplied by (L+1) to maintain service levels despite the zero on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Correction: 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21). Effective 'In-transit' is 981 units (from P37). Demand mean for the most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) is 305.8 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are observing the start of November. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has stabilized following the summer peak, with the most recent 5-period mean (P34-P38) being approximately 280 units. In-transit inventory stands at 2699 units, but based on carry-over insights, 1718 units (from orders P4, P10, P13, P15, and P21) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 981 units (ordered in Period 37). With a promised lead time of 2, this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 39 (visible in Period 40). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are entering a stable demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 280 * (1+2) = 840) to maintain a lean inventory while covering the lead time. The OR backend will see 2699 in pipeline; since 1718 are lost, the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' will be overestimated. I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) is high enough to trigger an order if the 981 units don't arrive or to prepare for the upcoming holiday season if demand begins to rise.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for the period range P34-P38 is ~280 units, confirming post-summer stabilization. Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory remains 1718 units (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21). Effective pipeline is the 981 units ordered in P37.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a post-summer demand phase where trainer socks demand has moderated. The mean demand for the last five periods (P35-P39) is 265.8 units. The 'In-transit' total of 2699 units is heavily skewed by 1718 confirmed lost units (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21). Excluding these, the effective pipeline consists of 981 units ordered in P37. Given the promised lead time is 2, the P37 order should have arrived in P39 (visible in P40 START). Since 'In-transit' remains 2699 and the P39 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', the P37 order is officially 1 period delayed but not yet confirmed lost. We will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for this delay and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime of ~266 units while maintaining a conservative buffer for potential volatility (as seen in P33). Setting L to 3 (explicit) signals to the OR backend that the pipeline needs to cover a longer horizon, effectively compensating for the currently delayed P37 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 37 (981 units) is delayed (L=2 promised, 2 periods elapsed with no arrival). Effective pipeline inventory is 981; 1718 units in 'In-transit' remain confirmed lost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019): On-hand inventory is 729 units following the arrival of the Period 37 order (981 units) after a lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units consists entirely of orders confirmed lost (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21), meaning effective pipeline inventory is zero. Demand has cooled from summer peaks and is currently stable; the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 263 units. Given the approach of the winter season and the recent observation of a 3-period lead time (P37 order), I am setting L=3 to be conservative. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-summer demand regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as potentially extending to 3 periods (P37 order arrived in P40). Post-summer demand regime (P36-P40) is stable with a mean of ~263 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the product (trainer socks) is in a post-summer demand cooling phase. The demand mean over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 257 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peak of ~350 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 519 units. Regarding the pipeline, the 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units remains composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, and P21), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. The most recent order from P37 arrived in P40, confirming a potential lead time extension to 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to account for this recent delay and use recent_N (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the current stabilized, lower demand regime. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that reflects current sales trends while acknowledging the higher lead time to prevent stockouts if delivery remains slow.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: mean demand for P37-P41 is 257 units. Lead time is currently estimated at 3 periods based on P37 order arrival.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). The product is trainer socks, which typically see a slight demand increase during the holiday gift-giving season but remain relatively stable compared to the summer peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has averaged 266.6 units, while the most recent demand was a higher spike of 354 units. On-hand inventory is 165 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units is confirmed lost (Orders from P4, P10, P13, P15, P21), meaning effective pipeline inventory is zero. Recent lead time history shows a shift from 2 periods to 3 periods (P37 arrived in P40). To prevent stockouts during the December period, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays and the holiday shipping season. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture the stable post-summer mean of ~267 units per period while accounting for the extended lead time (backend calculates (1+L)*mean). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods based on P37 arrival in P40. December demand (P42) shows a potential holiday spike (354 units) compared to the Nov mean of ~234.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand in P42 spiked to 354, then dropped in P43 to 143. This high volatility is typical for the lead-up to the Christmas holiday period for trainer socks, which serve as both practical winter layers and gift items. The current on-hand inventory is very low (22 units). Regarding the pipeline: the 'In-transit' figure of 1718 is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21) as documented in Carry-Over Insights. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. To protect against the anticipated December demand volatility and the observed lead time extension (L=3 observed in the most recent arrival from P37), I am setting L=3 and using an explicit mu_hat to account for holiday demand. Given the P42 spike (354) and the need to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, I'll forecast an average of 300 units per period (1200 total) to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 4 periods of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Holiday volatility confirmed: P42 demand spike to 354 followed by P43 drop to 143. Pipeline remains compromised; all 1718 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 45 (Dec 16, 2019). The SKU is a '7p Basic Shaftless' trainer sock. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21) and does not represent usable inventory. Recent demand shows significant holiday volatility: P42 (354 units), P43 (143 units), and P44 (209 units). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 233.6 units, but this includes a period of stockout-suppressed sales. The actual demand mean for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 233.6, while the 10-period mean (P35-P44) is 253.7. Given we are in the week before Christmas, I anticipate a minor pre-holiday surge followed by a post-holiday dip. Lead time (L) has recently shown an extension to 3 periods (observed in P40). I will set L to 3 to account for this supply chain instability. I'll use a 10-period window for mu_hat to capture the current lower winter baseline while smoothing the high volatility of the last three weeks, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance seen in Dec.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P42-P44) shows extreme volatility (range 143-354). Actual Lead Time is currently modeled as 3 periods based on the arrival of the P37 order in P40.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), just before Christmas. The demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown holiday volatility in December (P42-P45: 354, 143, 209, 231). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 229 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1718 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P13, P15, P21), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. The last successful delivery (P37 order) arrived in P40, establishing an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. To recover from the current stockout and cover the (L+1) = 4 period risk horizon during a period of high volatility, I am setting L=3 and using a recent 5-period window for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~229 units), while using a broader 10-period window for sigma_hat to account for recent spikes (like the 354 in P42). The OR backend will see an effective inventory position of 0 (since it doesn't know about the losses, but I have accounted for them by ensuring the order size is not capped too low), which should trigger a substantial replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P42-P45) mean is ~234 units with high volatility (143-354). Actual Lead Time remains 3 periods based on P37 arrival in P40.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). In-transit inventory shows 1718 units, but based on extensive historical tracking (Periods 4, 10, 13, 15, 21), these are confirmed as lost shipments. The effective pipeline and on-hand inventory are both zero. Recent demand (P42-P46) reflects holiday volatility but has stabilized to a lower mean of approximately 232 units. The lead time was most recently observed as 3 periods (P37 order arriving in P40), which deviates from the promised 2 periods. To recover from the stockout and account for the observed lead time, I am setting L to 3 and using the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the most recent demand regime and holiday volatility.
