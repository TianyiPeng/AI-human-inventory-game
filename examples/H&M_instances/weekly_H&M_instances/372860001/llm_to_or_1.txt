Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks). The historical demand sequence [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] indicates a stable demand regime with a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of 26.6. Since this is the first period of the simulation, we have no observed arrivals to infer lead time deviation, so we will use the promised lead time (L=4). Using the formula (1+L) * mean, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period is 5 * 266.4 = 1332. Given the item is basic trainer socks and it is mid-February, we don't anticipate immediate catastrophic seasonality changes, though we will monitor for spring upticks. 'recent_N' with N=5 is chosen to capture the most recent stability in demand while ignoring any older, irrelevant noise if more history becomes available.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The SKU is a basic cotton blend trainer sock. Promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 310 units, but because the lead time is at least 1, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 is expected). Demand in Period 1 was 287, which we couldn't meet because on-hand inventory was 0. Total history shows demands: [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287]. The mean is approx 270. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the slight upward trend in demand (287 is above the prior mean), we will setting the parameters to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the pipeline. Since current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 310, the engine will likely order more to reach the target base stock of ~1350 units (270 * 5).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including those before the game started) shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272]. However, P1 and P2 demand spiked significantly to 287 and 548 respectively, suggesting a shift or seasonal effect for women's trainer socks as we approach spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders from P1 (310 units) and P2 (307 units) are currently in-transit and expected around P5 and P6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the recent sharp increase in demand (avg ~417). For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=2 to reflect the increased volatility. Lead time (L) remains at default as we haven't reached the promised arrival date yet to verify any drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: Average demand increased from ~266 to 417 (+56%) over the last two periods (P1-P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (Womens Socks) showed a demand spike starting Period 2 (287 to 548, then 399). The average demand over the last three observed periods (P1-P3) is ~411. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,339 units in transit from orders placed in P1, P2, and P3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Following the timing rules, the P1 order (310 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Since no orders have reached their promised delivery date yet, we maintain the default lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the higher demand regime observed since the start of the simulation (average ~411, versus the pre-game history of ~266). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high turnover to recover from the current stockout once arrivals begin.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The SKU '372860001' (Womens trainer socks) is experiencing a period of stockouts as the initial orders have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My first order was placed in the decision phase of Period 1; according to the 'Lead Time Definition', this order should arrive during Period 1+4=5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a significant jump starting in Period 2 (287 to 548), then stabilizing around 340-400 (399, 338). The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 393. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Existing in-transit (1966) divided by 5 is roughly 393, which aligns well with recent performance. No shipments are confirmed lost yet as the first order is only due to arrive this period. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the shift from the very low pre-game values to the current active demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 2: Mean demand across P2-P4 is 428 units, significantly higher than pre-game average of 266.

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the concluded Period 5, the first order (P1) arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Demand history shows a significant shift early on: pre-game mean was 266, but history [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, (P1) 287, (P2) 548, (P3) 399, (P4) 338, (P5) 252] shows high volatility. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is 364.8. Although demand dropped in P5 (252), the preceding three periods were very high. To avoid being misled by the recent drop while acknowledging the previous regime shift, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 (covering P1-P5). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture this high volatility. Lead time is set to default (4) as P1 confirmed it.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Analyzing the history: The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (P5 and P6 conclude), confirming L=4 is reliable. Current demand patterns show high volatility: P1-P6 demands are [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329]. This averages ~359 per period. However, the pre-game and early-game demand surge noted in carry-over insights (~428) was slightly higher than the recent cooling trend (avg of last 3 periods is 306). Given the SKU is 'Fine-knit trainer socks' and the date is late March, we are entering spring/summer where trainer socks typically see sustained demand. On-hand inventory is very low (36 units) while in-transit (pipeline) is high (1679 units) due to the large orders placed in P3 and P4 to catch up with initial stockouts. Those large orders (722 and 627) are expected to arrive in P7 and P8. I will set L=4 (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the full demand profile of the current active game which reflects the shift from pre-game stats. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to account for the high variance (specifically the P2 spike) to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across two observations (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6). Demand volatility remains high post-regime shift with a recent 3-period cooling trend (avg 306) compared to the initial surge (avg 428).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand in spring. History shows a demand shift: pre-game samples averaged 266, but Periods 1-7 averaged ~367. Specifically, after the initial high-variance burst (P2=548), demand has settled into a range of 329-415 in the last two periods. The mean of the last 7 periods (game history) is 366.8. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). The on-hand inventory is 343, with 1235 in transit. Current demand (P7) was 415. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average (approx 346 per period) while ignoring the extreme outlier in Period 2. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time remains 'default' at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau post-regime shift: Average demand from Period 3-7 is 346.4 units, representing the new stable volume for the spring season.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 9 (2019/4/8), the SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in the middle of the spring season. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the last four arrivals (P1-P4). Current on-hand inventory is 588, with 885 units in transit (expected arrivals of 212, 118, 278, and 277 over the next four periods). Since the regime shift in Period 2, demand has stabilized. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P3-P8) is 352.5 units, compared to the pre-game average of 266. This more recent window captures the current spring volume better than the full history. I am setting L to 4 (promised and verified). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=6 to target the stabilized demand of ~352 units/period, resulting in a base stock level covering 5 periods of demand (1+L). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility within this stable window.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized from Period 3-8 at an average of 352.5 units, confirming a sustained +32% increase over the pre-game average of 266.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see steady demand throughout spring. Since the initial demand surge in February, consumption has stabilized. Looking at the history from Period 3 to Period 9, the average demand is 348.6 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 9) was 322. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). With an on-hand inventory of 478 and pipeline inventory of 1075 (total 1553), and a promised lead time of 4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average of ~349, the required base stock is approximately 1745. My parameters aim to maintain this coverage. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (Periods 3-9) to capture this stable post-surge regime and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stability confirmed: Average demand from Period 3 to Period 9 is 348.6 units, establishing a new baseline for the spring season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is trainer socks, which typically see steady or increasing demand as spring weather warms up. Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift early in the sequence. Since Period 3, demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial data suggested. Specifically, the average demand from Period 3 through Period 10 is approximately 344 units per period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, ..., P6 arrived P10), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently well-managed with 288 units on hand and 1,250 units in the pipeline (scheduled arrivals for the next 4 periods). Given the stability over the last 8 periods, I am using recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-shift regime. L is set to default as the actual lead time aligns perfectly with the promised lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see steady demand throughout spring and early summer. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on multiple consecutive arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime following the early-season surge. Analyzing demand from Period 3 onwards (when the initial spike settled), the mean is approximately 349 units with moderate volatility. Period 11 saw a slight uptick to 427, but this remains within the expected variance of the established Spring regime. On-hand inventory is 139, and the pipeline is healthy (1251 units). I will continue using N=9 for mu_hat (covering Periods 3-11) to capture the stable Spring performance while smoothing out individual period fluctuations. I will use the same N=9 for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock levels appropriate for this stage of the season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic trainer sock. The date is early May (Period 13), approaching late spring/early summer, which is generally a period of high demand for low-cut socks. In Period 12, we stocked out (on-hand 0, sold 416 vs demand 438), confirming a significant demand surge that began in Period 11 (P11 demand: 427, P12 demand: 438). The average demand over these two periods (432.5) is significantly higher than the previously established baseline (~350). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P8 order arrived in P12). To prevent further stockouts during this seasonal transition, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the upward momentum (avg demand P9-P12 is 373.7, which scaled by 1+L=5 is 1868.5). I am also using recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand surge detected: Average demand increased from ~350 to ~430 (+23%) between Periods 11 and 12, likely reflecting seasonal demand for trainer socks.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is entering a peak season (mid-May). Historical demand shows a transition from a stable spring baseline (~350 units) to a higher late-spring level. While Period 13 saw a lower demand of 267, the previous two periods (P11-P12) averaged 432 units (+23% over baseline). This volatility is common for seasonal items. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 9 consecutive observations. With on-hand inventory at 135 and in-transit at 1505, the pipeline is substantial but must be maintained to meet the expected 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the most recent seasonal trend (averaging ~377), ensuring the OR engine has enough protection to handle potential late-spring surges while accounting for the recent localized dip.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Trainer Socks) is currently in a late-spring demand period (May 20). Historical demand shows volatility linked to potential seasonal surges, with a recent calming following a spike (P11-12 avg: 432; P13-14 avg: 271). However, the overall spring baseline (since P3) remains significantly higher (~340-350) than the pre-game average. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 153 units on-hand and high in-transit volume (1639), the priority is maintaining a sufficient (L+1) buffer. I will use the last 12 periods (P3-P14) as the stable demand regime for mu_hat to capture the spring baseline while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat will be calculated on the same window to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed variance during this period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May (2019/5/27), and the product is 'fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during late spring and early summer. Historical analysis shows a demand regime shift in Period 11, with the average demand from Period 11-15 rising to approximately 351 units (427, 438, 267, 275, 348), compared to the earlier baseline. Although demand dipped in Periods 13 and 14, the overall trend for this seasonal product is upwards as summer approaches. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P13, P14, and P15). We have a significant in-transit pipeline (1421 units), but on-hand inventory is low (84 units). To ensure we capture the early summer peak while avoiding stockouts on this high-profit-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to respond to the most recent demand behavior while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Trainer sock demand regime maintained: Average demand for Periods 11-15 is ~351 units, reflecting seasonal transition into summer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd. The product is trainer socks, which are in peak seasonal demand during the summer months. Recent demand (Periods 11-16) has averaged 370.8 units, showing a sustained high-volume regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on observations up to Period 16. The high in-transit quantity (1377 units) covers roughly 3.7 periods of demand at the current average, while on-hand inventory is low (161 units). To maintain availability during the summer peak while accounting for the high unit profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1), I will use the recent 6 periods of demand (Period 11-16) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent summer-transition regime. L is set to calculate as lead times have been consistent at 4.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Period 11-16): Average demand is 370.8 units, reflecting seasonal peak for trainer socks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which are in peak seasonal demand during the current June (summer) period. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). The demand profile since Period 11 (mid-April to early June) has averaged 353 units, with a slight peak around late April/early May. Taking the mean of the most recent 7 periods (P11-P17) provides a demand estimate of 353.1 units per period. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mu_hat, so for L=4, it will use a total cycle demand of 1765.5 units. Current on-hand (350) + in-transit (1261) = 1611 units. Given the seasonality and the high critical ratio (Profit=4, Holding=1 => q=0.8), I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant summer demand regime while maintaining protection against volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is trainer socks, which are currently in their peak summer season (June). Analysis of demand from Period 13 to Period 18 shows an average of 308.5 units per period. While earlier observations in the summer regime (P11-P12) spiked above 400, recent weeks (P17-P18) have cooled slightly to ~295. To balance the seasonal peak with recent stabilization, I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the current summer pricing/demand block. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals, so 'default' (promised lead time) is appropriate. The on-hand inventory is healthy (483), and the pipeline (1085) is well-distributed, following the 4-period lead time logic.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during late spring and summer (June/July). Current date is June 24th (Period 20). Historical demand from Period 11 to 19 (the summer regime) shows an average of ~342 units, with a notable peak of 438 units in Period 12. Although the last three periods (P17-P19) show a slight dip (avg ~308), we are entering the peak summer period where demand for trainer socks remains high. Lead time (L) is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P11-P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand profile while being responsive to recent volatility. This provides a mu_hat calculation over (L+1)=5 periods based on the summer baseline of ~342 units/period, ensuring we maintain enough stock for the seasonal peak without excessive holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its peak summer season. Demand from Period 11 to Period 20 has averaged approximately 334 units, showing some volatility but maintaining a consistent baseline for the early summer months. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals in the history. Profit to holding cost ratio suggests a high target service level (q = 0.8). I am using a recent window (N=10, covering Periods 11-20) to capture the summer demand profile and provide the OR engine with the most relevant mean and standard deviation for the current season. Pipeline inventory is healthy (1117 units in transit + 324 on-hand), and setting parameters based on the last 10 periods will allow the OR controller to maintain appropriate stock levels without over-ordering as we move through peak summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Summer demand regime for trainer socks (Periods 11-20) stabilized at an average of 334 units, slightly lower than the late-spring surge but significantly above the pre-game baseline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019/7/8) represents the peak summer season for 'fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand from Period 11 to 21 has established a summer regime with an average of 332.4 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals (P14-P17 orders). Current on-hand inventory is 377 units with 1,092 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). To maintain the optimal base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting L to 'default' (4 periods) and using 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat to capture the full summer regime starting from P11. This N value accounts for the transition from the late-spring surge into the more stable summer volume, providing a robust estimate for the remaining summer weeks.

The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in peak summer season (July 15). Demand has been stable since the start of summer (Period 11), with the most recent 10-period average (P11-P20) at approximately 334 units and the last 3 periods showing a slight dip (317, 313). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full seasonal context from May through July, ensuring mu_hat reflects this established summer baseline. Lead time (L) has remained perfectly consistent at 4 periods across 18 confirmed arrivals (P5-P22). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the current demand volatility during the peak season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in late July (2019/7/22). As we move into high summer, demand for trainer socks remains elevated compared to the early spring baseline but has stabilized. The average demand across the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is roughly 325 units, which is consistent with the summer regime documented in Carry-Over Insights. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P19 order arrived in P23). Current on-hand inventory is very low (16 units), but a large order (443 units from P20) should arrive during this period (P24 resolution phase), followed by 345 units in P25. To maintain service level without excessive holding cost, I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable summer demand profile. I will continue using 'calculate' for Lead Time as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal summer staple. Data for Periods 21-24 shows demand (317, 313, 352, 277) with an average of 314.75 units. This indicates a cooling trend from the high-summer peak observed in Periods 11-20 (avg 334). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 182 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 1195 units. Given the late July date (2019/7/29), we expect a gradual decline in trainer sock demand as the school and autumn seasons approach. I am using a recent window (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this cooling trend while maintaining sufficient safety stock via a standard volatility calculation.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer transition detected: Average demand for trainer socks in the last 4 periods (P21-P24) cooled to 314.8, down from the mid-summer average of 334.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). The product (fine-knit trainer socks) has likely passed its peak summer demand. Historically, demand for trainer socks cools down as the transition to autumn begins. In the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has averaged 283 units, which is lower than the mid-summer average of ~334 units and significantly lower than the late-spring surge (>400 units). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 271 and 1150 units in transit (covering roughly 4 future periods at the current demand rate), I will adjust parameters to reflect this cooling trend. I'll use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent decline in demand while discarding the higher summer peaks. L will remain at the promised/calculated value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed. Average demand for Periods 21-25 is 283.0 units, down from the mid-summer peak average of ~334. This likely marks the seasonal transition away from trainer socks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late summer transition (August 12) for SKU 372860001 (trainer socks). Demand has clearly cooled from the summer peak (avg ~334) to a lower baseline. Specifically, demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) has averaged 278.8 units, which is a return toward the pre-game baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 316, with 1012 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods). Since the 'promising' lead time of 4 is consistently observed (all recent arrivals occurred at exactly 4 periods), I will keep L at 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am selecting N=6 to capture this recent post-summer cooling trend while maintaining enough data for stable calculation. This approach allows the OR backend to adjust order quantities downward, avoiding excessive holding costs as the season for trainer socks continues to wind down.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for Periods 21-26 is 278.8 units, down from the mid-summer peak average of ~334. This marks the transition out of the peak trainer sock season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently transitioning out of its summer peak demand period into a cooler late-August/early-September regime. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P21-P27) has averaged 282.0 units, a clear drop from the mid-summer average of ~334 units. Recent demand has stabilized around this lower level (P27 demand was 301, P26 was 258, P25 was 256). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this post-summer cooling while maintaining responsiveness to the new baseline. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P23 order arrived P27 in exactly 4 periods). Pipeline inventory (on-hand 316 + in-transit 933) is 1249, which covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the new lower rate, suggesting the OR engine will moderate order sizes to align with the lower demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling for trainer socks confirmed: Average demand for Periods 21-27 is 282.0 units, down ~15% from the mid-summer peak average of ~334.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences peak demand during late spring and summer. Current date is August 26 (Period 29), signaling the transition into autumn. Historical demand data shows a clear cooling trend: the mid-summer peak (Periods 11-20) averaged ~334 units, whereas the most recent eight periods (Periods 21-28) have averaged 278.5 units [317, 313, 352, 277, 256, 258, 301, 294]. This validates a sustained regime shift as consumers move away from shaftless/trainer socks. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the last 24 arrivals. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower post-summer demand level and avoid over-ordering during the seasonal decline. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the stable historical average.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand contraction for trainer socks confirmed: Average demand for Periods 21-28 is 278.5 units, a ~17% decrease from the mid-summer peak of 334. This likely reflects a seasonal shift as weather cools.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is experiencing a seasonal demand contraction as summer ends and we enter September. Analysis of historical demand from Period 21 to Period 29 shows a clear downtrend: the average demand in this range is 278.5 units, significantly lower than the mid-summer peak (>330). The most recent sample (P29) is 229, indicating the decline may still be occurring as weather cools further. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals (P25 order arrived as scheduled, read at P26-P29). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the post-summer regime (P21-P29). Sigma_hat will also use N=9 to reflect the current volatility of this settling demand. This approach ensures the inventory targets adjust downward to avoid excessive holding costs as the product's peak season concludes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which are highly seasonal. We are now in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), moving into early autumn. Recent demand history shows a clear cooling trend from the mid-summer peak. Demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has averaged 271.2 units, compared to the summer average of 334. The carry-over insights confirm this contraction. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on a consistent arrival history (P26 order arrived P30). With on-hand inventory at 230 and in-transit at 1010, there is sufficient stock to cover the immediate term, but we must maintain the base stock to match this new lower demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer cooling while keeping enough sensitivity to detect any further declines as we enter colder months.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand contraction confirmed: Starting Period 21, demand for trainer socks shifted to a lower regime. Average demand for Periods 21-30 is 275.9 units, a ~17% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in an autumn demand contraction phase. Since Period 21, demand has shifted to a lower regime compared to the summer peak. The average demand for the most recent 10-period window (Periods 21-30) is 275.9 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 254, consistent with this lower regime. Current inventory status reflects 198 units on-hand and 1051 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the multi-month stable contraction, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 (covering Period 21 to 31) to capture the current mean of ~274 units/period, which results in a mu_hat of approximately 1370 ((1+4)*274). The sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect recent volatility. This maintains a stock level appropriate for the cooled demand while preventing overstocking as the season progresses further into autumn.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The SKU is trainer socks, which exhibit strong seasonal patterns. Historical data confirms a transition from a summer peak (approx. 334 units/period) to an autumn cooling period (approx. 275 units/period starting at Period 21). The average demand over the last 12 periods (P21-P32) is approximately 269 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) averaging 260 units. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. Given the product's seasonal nature and the cooling weather in late September, I will use a shorter demand window (N=12) to reflect the autumn regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for (L+1) = 5 periods of this lower demand levels, preventing excessive holding costs as the season ends.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks in Period 33 spiked to 405 units, significantly above the recent autumn average of ~276 units established since Period 21. While the long-term trend (P21 onwards) suggests a cooling period, this sudden jump in late September could signal a late-season promotional peak or a one-off fluctuation. However, given the product type (socks), demand is generally stable. My priority is to prevent stockouts while reflecting the recent regime. The average demand from Period 21 to Period 33 is 285.8 units. I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this entire post-summer regime, which includes the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 286 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/7 (Period 35). We are seeing a slight uptick in demand for trainer socks over the last two periods (P33: 405, P34: 312), which contrasts with the previously established autumn contraction (P21-P30 average was 275.9). The average demand for the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is 304.75 units. While the carry-over insight noted a contraction, the recent volatility suggests a slightly higher mean is needed to cover potential spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P30 order in P34. Inventory position: On-hand is low (21), but in-transit is substantial (1104). Pipeline includes orders from Period 31 (263), 32 (238), 33 (233), and 34 (370). The backend will calculate base stock using L=4 and demand across (L+1)=5 periods. I am setting N=14 for mu_hat to capture the broader late-summer to autumn transition while acknowledging recent volatility, and N=14 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in the most recent periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees lower demand in autumn compared to summer. Historical demand analysis shows a stable autumn regime starting Period 21. For the last 15 periods (P21-P35), the average demand is 289.4 units, with a slight uptick in the last 3 periods (P33-P35 avg = 327.7), likely due to promotional activity or inventory-driven volatility (e.g., P33 spike to 405). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (18 units), following a period of near stock-outs (P34 ending inventory 21), but the pipeline is very healthy (1210 units). Given the high pipeline and the transition to a lower-demand season, I will use a 15-period lookback window (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-summer regime accurately while weighting recent variance. This provides a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1) while the capped policy ensures we don't over-order against the existing large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P21-P35) stabilized at an average of 289.4 units, representing a sustained decrease from the summer peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an autumn demand regime. After a mid-summer peak (~334 units), demand shifted downward starting around Period 21. For the period P21-P36, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 289 units. The most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) show an average of 294.2 units, indicating high stability with the occasional spike (P33). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) compared to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (approx 80%). To capture the current stabilized autumn regime and filter out the earlier summer peak, I am using recent_N=16 for mu_hat (covering the shift from Period 21 to 36) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility without over-responding to the P33 outlier. On-hand inventory is low (16), but the pipeline is well-stocked (~1282 units), so the capped policy will likely moderate new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in an autumn regime. From Period 21 to Period 37, the average demand is 283.4 units. Although Period 37 showed a slight stockout with demand at 306, the overall trend since the summer peak (334 units) has been a stabilization around the high 280s. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P33 order arrived in P37). Inventory is currently tight (on-hand 0), but there are 1284 units in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of average demand. To stabilize the service level and account for recent volatility (std dev ~45-50), I will set mu_hat based on the last 17 periods (N=17, starting P21) to capture the current seasonal volume, and use the default calculation for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock during this stockout period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 39 (early November). The product is fine-knit trainer socks, which typically see decreased demand moving into colder months. The 'Autumn demand regime' (beginning Period 21) shows an average demand of 289.4 units, but recent weeks (P34-P38) show a slight uptick with an average of 288.6 (276, 306, 240, 266, 312). Although there was a stockout in Period 37 due to high demand (306) and low initial stock, an order of 370 units arrived in Period 38, leaving 94 units on hand. The pipeline inventory is healthy at 1196 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. Given the approach of winter (traditionally low for trainer socks) and the 'Autumn' baseline, I will use a recent_N window of 18 (covering the regime since Period 21) to stabilize the mu_hat and sigma_hat around the current seasonal trend (~285-290 units per period). This allows for moderate safety stock to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the likely seasonal downtrend.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, entering the late-autumn/early-winter season (Period 40). Analysis of demand since Period 21 shows a stabilized 'post-summer' regime. Over the most recent 15 periods (P25-P39), demand has averaged 272.9 units (std dev ~47), with high volatility peaking occasionally (e.g., P33). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P35 order arriving at P39). On-hand inventory is healthy at 222 units. Since the autumn/winter demand for trainer socks is typically lower and stable, I will use recent_N=15 to capture the full breadth of this lower-regime volatility while centering the mean on the current seasonal baseline. This balances the risk of stockouts during minor spikes against the holding costs of excess inventory during a generally slower sales period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P21-P39) is now well-established with an average of 274.6 units, reflecting a ~18% decrease from the summer peak (334).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see lower demand in late autumn and winter. The 'Autumn demand regime' (P21 onwards) has established a stable baseline with an average demand of approximately 275 units (calculated from Period 21 to Period 40). Recent demand has been very consistent (240, 306, 276, 241, 252). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 280 and 937 units in transit (covering roughly 3-4 periods of demand), the system is well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the specific demand characteristics of this autumn regime, as it provides a stable mean (~275) and handles the moderate volatility seen during this period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the holiday season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). For 372860001 (trainer socks), historical autumn demand (P21-P39) has been stable at an average of 274.6 units. However, recent demand in P41 dropped slightly to 210 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P37 order. With on-hand inventory at 305 and 984 units in-transit (covering orders from P38-P41), the pipeline is well-stocked. Given the product category (Socks) and the date (late November), there is a possibility of a holiday uptick, although 'trainer socks' are typically less seasonal in winter than heavier hosiery. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the established autumn baseline while allowing for slight responsiveness to the upcoming retail surge. L is set to calculated as it has been extremely stable at 4.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks'. Historically, trainer socks show seasonal dips in winter as weather cools. The 'Autumn' regime identified in carry-over insights spans Period 21 to Period 42. Since Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 280 units (calculated as total demand P21-P42 = 6159 / 22 periods \u2248 280). However, the most recent demand in P42 was 354, and P33 was 405, showing significant volatility. Given the 'Womens Nightwear, Socks & Tights' category and the December date, we should anticipate potential holiday-related gifting spikes or conversely, a continued seasonal low for 'trainer' socks specifically. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-summer regime while maintaining enough variance for safety. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The balance of on-hand (233) and in-transit (895) is robust, but since the simulation is nearing its end (Period 47), the base stock calculation will naturally moderate the ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an autumn/winter demand regime. Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 143, following a demand of 354 in Period 42. Looking at the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has been [241, 252, 210, 354, 143], averaging 240 units. This is lower than the previous autumn average of ~275, suggesting a further seasonal cooling as we enter December. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. With 320 units on hand and 1024 units in transit (covering orders from P40, P41, P42, P43), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this latest downtrend while maintaining a buffer for volatility, and default for sigma to allow the backend to use the full history of this lower-demand regime since Period 21.

Carry-over insight: Early winter demand cooling: Average demand for Periods 39-43 dropped to 240.0 units, a ~13% decrease from the previous autumn baseline of 274.6.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (Dec 16), demand for trainer socks (372860001) has entered a winter low. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 233.6 units, confirming the 'Early winter demand cooling' flagged in the carry-over insights. With the end-of-game approaching (Period 47), lead time management is critical. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is consistently observed in the history. Orders placed now (P45) would arrive in Period 49, which is past the game end. Therefore, current inventory levels (On-hand: 301 + In-transit: 834 = 1135) are significantly higher than the expected remaining demand (approx. 3 periods * 233 units = 699 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower winter demand regime. The OR backend will likely zero out orders as the pipeline inventory (1135) exceeds the required base stock for the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime established (Period 40-44): Average demand is 233.6 units, reflecting a seasonal minimum for trainer socks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas/Christmas week. This is an extremely critical period for winter accessories like socks. Historical demand since Period 40 (mid-November) has averaged 233 units, but Period 42 showed a significant spike to 354, and Period 43 a sharp drop to 143, indicating high holiday-related volatility. While trainer socks are typically summer items, the 'Fine-knit cotton blend' description and 'Nightwear' category suggest they may be purchased as stocking fillers or gifts. However, usually, after December 25th, retail demand for these categories drops significantly (post-holiday slump). I will assume a demand regime of N=6 (Periods 40-45) to capture the winter baseline (avg 233.16), but I expect Period 46/47 demand to be lower as the gift-buying season ends. I am setting L=4, which has been consistently observed. mu_hat will use recent_N=6 to reflect this current winter baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, concluding the winter season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand analysis confirms a sustained downward shift in demand since Period 40, likely due to seasonal misalignment (trainer socks in winter). The last 7 periods (P40-P46) show an average demand of 231.3 units, compared to the autumn average of ~275. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 321 units and 752 units in-transit (expected arrivals of 359, 0, 180, and 213 over the next four periods), the pipeline is sufficient to cover the current low-demand regime. I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent winter baseline and 'calculate' for lead time to affirm the stable 4-period window.
