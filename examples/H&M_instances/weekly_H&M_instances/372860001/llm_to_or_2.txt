Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's Fine-knit trainer socks). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] shows a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of 26.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the product category (socks) and the late winter/early spring date (Feb 11), demand appears relatively stable with moderate volatility. I will use the default promised lead time and apply the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns for the OR backend calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The SKU 372860001 (Women's Socks) had a demand of 287 in Period 1, which exceeded our zero on-hand inventory. The order of 310 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 4 periods (expected arrival in Period 5). Historical demands are [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287], showing a stable mean around 270. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using the mean of all 6 samples (~270), mu_hat should be approximately 1350 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the slightly higher recent demand trend while maintaining stability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and 2 show a total demand of 835 units (287 + 548). No stock has arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 617 units in transit (310 from P1 + 307 from P2). The product 'Women's Trainer Socks' is a basic item. Period 2 saw a significant demand spike (548 vs Period 1's 287), potentially due to late February seasonal transitions or a stock-out consequence elsewhere. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to weight the recent high demand more heavily while relying on the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the (L+1)=5 period window accounting for the recent surge.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the initial order from Period 1 is not expected to arrive until the end of this period (visible in Period 5). Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently losing all demand. The total in-transit units (1339) cover the orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (310 + 307 + 722 = 1339). Demand history shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (pre-history) and [287, 548, 399] (active game), showing a significant spike in Period 2 (548) before returning to a higher-than-historical level. I will use recent_N (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent elevated demand trend while waiting for the lead time to conclude. L is set to default (4) as no orders have arrived to suggest a deviation yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks, which typically sees steady demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, the order from Period 1 (310 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclusion message (read at Period 6). The total demand history [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287, 548, 399, 338] shows a significant spike in Period 2 (548) but has since stabilized between 338-400. Total In-transit is 1966 (310+307+722+627). In-transit + On-hand (1966) currently covers about 5.5 periods of demand (avg ~355 per lead time window). I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have reached the 4-period mark to prove a delay yet. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-spike stabilization while acknowledging the high volume, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks, which typically sees steady demand as a basic item. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is low (58), but a large pipeline (1745 units) is in transit. Given the historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287, 548, 399, 338, 252], there was a significant spike in Periods 2-4 (averaging ~428), but demand has since cooled down to ~252 in Period 5. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the volatility. The OR engine will use these parameters to determine if the existing pipeline (1745) covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demand is [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329]. There was a significant demand spike in Period 2 (Date 2019/2/18, demand=548) and Period 3 (demand=399), which corresponds to the late February period. Since then, demand has stabilized around a mean of ~306 units over the last 3 periods (P4-P6). The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 36) because sales only started in P5 after the first shipment arrived. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the post-spike demand levels for the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to avoid over-preparing for a spike that has passed, while maintaining enough safety stock for the current moderate demand. Pipeline inventory is high (1679), so the OR engine will likely order a smaller amount to adjust.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Womens Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand shows a rising trend since Period 5, coinciding with spring seasonality (April 1st). Recent demand samples (P5, P6, P7) are [252, 329, 415], with a mean of 332. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P5, P6, and P7 arrivals confirm L=4). Pipeline inventory is healthy (1317 units in transit). Given the trend, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the upward demand trajectory associated with warmer weather/spring fashion. Holding cost is significant ($1) relative to profit ($4), so the OR backend will calculate a base_stock targeting an 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 5 (transition to spring): avg demand increasing from ~250 to 415. Promised lead time of 4 periods confirmed as stable.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (April 8). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal increase as spring progresses. Carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 7 and 8) confirm a demand regime shift starting around Period 5, with the average demand rising from ~250 to ~400. Specifically, demands since the shift (Periods 5-8) were 252, 329, 415, and 382. The average for these 4 periods is 344.5, but the last two periods averaged ~400. Given the seasonal nature of trainer socks in April, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new level while smoothing slightly. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5-P8). Current on-hand (588) and in-transit (844) total 1432, which is roughly 3.5 periods of coverage at the new demand level; since L=4, we need to maintain a pipeline for (L+1)=5 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees increased demand as weather warms in spring. Looking at the demand history since Period 5, demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to early February/March. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P6-P9) show demands of 329, 415, 382, and 322 (average 362). While P7 was a peak, the trend is generally upwards from the initial winter baseline. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (observed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). I will use a N=5 window for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current spring regime, which covers Periods 5 through 9. This period (P10) is also the week preceding/around Easter in 2019, which might see a slight bump in retail activity for basic apparel. Safety stock (sigma_hat) will also be calculated using the recent 5-period volatility to ensure we handle the fluctuations observed in P7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Spring demand (P5-P9) average ~360 units, up from P1-P4 average ~240 units (sold demand was 0 in P1-P4 due to no stock, but actual demand was higher). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (Late April). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees strong demand as spring progresses into summer. Historical demand analysis shows two regimes: Period 1-4 (avg demand ~393, though sold units were 0 due to stockouts) and Period 5-10 (avg demand ~335). The most recent three periods (P8-P10) show a slight cooling or stabilization compared to the P7 peak, with demand at 382, 322, and 308 respectively (avg ~337). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 288 and 1222 units in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) window (5 periods). Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat correctly captures the stabilized spring regime (P5-P10 average). I will use N=6 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see sustained or increasing demand as spring progresses into summer. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-4 demand averaged ~393 (unfilled due to stockouts), while Period 5-11 demand averaged ~349. However, the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged ~371. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P10, P11 all confirmed L=4). For Period 12, I will set L to 'default' as the promised time is reliable. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand stabilization observed since the inventory started arriving in Period 5. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect the volatility of this more recent stable regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and early summer as weather warms. Recent history (Period 11-12) shows a demand surge to over 425 units, leading to a stockout in Period 12 (0 on-hand, 375 sold vs 438 demand). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we are in a high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current mean (approx 375, spanning P8-P12) and increased volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while addressing the recent stockout. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time consistency.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed: Period 11-12 demand average ~430 units, coinciding with seasonal transition to trainer socks in May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May), managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a product with clear seasonal relevance as temperatures rise. Currently, demand is in a higher regime compared to early spring. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 352 units, though P11 and P12 saw spikes above 400. P13 saw a dip to 267. Given the 'trainer socks' profile and May date, I expect demand to remain in this higher range (350-450). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (158), but there is a significant pipeline (1480). To ensure we handle the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand, higher-volatility spring regime while adjusting for the recent variability. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 7-pack of basic shaftless/trainer socks. Historical data shows a clear seasonal progression as we move into late May. Initial demand (Period 1-4) had issues with stockouts, but revealed high latent demand. A spring regime (P5-P10) averaged ~335 units. The most recent window (P11-P14) exhibits higher volatility with a peak near 438 units, but the two most recent periods (P13-P14) dropped significantly to ~271 units. This fluctuation suggests volatility rather than a sustained downward shift, given the product type (trainer socks) is highly relevant for the upcoming summer season. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (L=4). To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use a window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~340 units, which balances the high late-April spikes with the moderate mid-May demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the high recent variability (267 to 438) and maintain a sufficient safety stock for the lead time + review period (5 total periods of demand to cover).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late May, which is peak season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand shows a distinct regime shift starting around Period 11, with demand frequently exceeding 400 units, though the last three periods (P13-P15) averaged ~296 units. Given the seasonality and the product type, demand is likely to remain high or increase further as we head into summer. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on consistently observed arrivals from P5 through P15. Current on-hand inventory is low (90 units), but a large order from P12 (452 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P16). To ensure we cover demand across the next 5 periods (L+1), I will use the recent demand profile from Period 11 onwards (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the higher seasonal volatility and volume better than the full history which includes out-of-stock periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early June (Period 17), managing '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks'. Demand has been consistently strong as we entered the warmer months, with a notable regime shift around Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged approximately 340 units, though Period 11 and 12 were significantly higher (avg 430). The recent demand (P13-P16) suggests a slight stabilization or cooling compared to the May peak, averaging 315 units. However, trainer socks are seasonally relevant for the current summer dates. Lead time continues to be consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 16 conclude). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher May-June demand level (avg ~355) while covering the L+1 (5 period) risk horizon. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility in this higher-demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early June (2019/06/10), managing a SKU for trainer socks, which are highly seasonal for the summer. Analysis of the demand history reveals three distinct phases: Phase 1 (P1-P4) had an average demand of ~393 units (unmet due to zero stock); Phase 2 (P5-P12) saw a rise to ~360 units with peaks near 430; and Phase 3 (P13-P17) shows a cooling period with an average of ~291 units. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all 13 observed arrivals (P5 through P17). Current on-hand inventory is 348 units, with a large pipeline of 1263 units. Given the recent drop in demand over the last 5 periods (avg 291) compared to the higher May peaks, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized summer volume and avoid over-ordering against the large pipeline. Lead time is set to default as the promised 4 periods is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower summer level: Period 13-17 average demand is ~291 units, down from the May peak of ~430 units (-32%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in late spring (May) followed by a stabilization in summer (June). Period 18 demand was 294, following a sequence of [267, 275, 348, 370, 297]. The current summer regime (Periods 13-18) average demand is 308.5, which is a significant drop from the May peak. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized summer demand level (approx 308 units per period). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all history. On-hand (321) plus Pipeline (1028) equals 1349 units, which covers about 4.4 periods of demand at the current average. Given the promised lead time L=4, the OR engine needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. With 1349 units already in the system, we are slightly below the required coverage for 5 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 will accurately reflect current volatility and mean demand without overweighting the spring peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in late June (Period 20, 2019/6/24). As confirmed in Period 18, demand has stabilized at a lower summer level following a May peak. The average demand for the last seven periods (P13-P19) is approximately 312 units ([267+275+348+370+297+294+334]/7 = 312.14). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across the entire history, including the most recent arrival (P15 order arriving in P19). In-transit inventory is high (1058 units) because of orders placed in periods 16-19, which are expected in periods 20-23. To reflect the current stable summer demand while accounting for recent variability, I'll use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time is very stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and early summer (May/June) and stabilizes as summer progresses. We are currently in Period 21 (July 1st). Since Period 13, demand has transitioned from a high of ~430 to a more stable summer level. Taking the average demand from Period 17 to Period 20 (297, 294, 334, 289), the mean demand is roughly 303 units per period. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods across all 16 delivered orders. Therefore, I will use lead time 'calculate' (or 4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current summer stabilization. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current volatility. With on-hand inventory at 324 and in-transit at 1021, the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time.

There is no evidence of a further drop or significant spike at this time. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 18, 19, 20, and 21). On-hand inventory is 377, and in-transit units (863) cover orders from Periods 18, 19, 20, and 21. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures the current stable summer demand level of ~306 units per period, which for L=4 results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+4) * 306 = 1530. This ensures sufficient stock for the lead time plus current review period while accounting for the lower volatility observed in the summer months.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in peak summer season (July 15). Demand has been very stable since Period 13, following a seasonal peak in May. From Period 13 to Period 22 (10 periods), the average demand is 299.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is low (96 units) due to a very small order arriving in Period 22 (ordered in Period 18 when demand was briefly underestimated), but the pipeline inventory (in-transit: 1158) is healthy, covering approximately 3.8 periods of supply at current demand rates. Given the high stability of demand over the last 10 periods (summer regime), I am using N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the earlier spring spikes. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 13-22) is highly stable: average ~300 units/period with low volatility (std ~32).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is July 22nd. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and early summer followed by stabilization. Recent data (Periods 18-23) shows a very stable demand regime with an average of approximately 316.5 units and low variance. Specifically, the last 6 periods of demand were [294, 334, 289, 317, 313, 352]. In-transit inventory of 1246 units corresponds to orders from Periods 20 (347), 21 (212), 22 (327), and 23 (360), which are scheduled to arrive in Periods 24 through 27 (since lead time remains precisely 4 periods). On-hand inventory is low (16), but an arrival of 347 units is expected during Period 24 resolution, which should cover current demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized summer demand pattern (roughly 315-320 units per period) while maintaining a safe service level for this high-margin (Profit/Holding = 4) item.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in late July (Period 25). Historical demand from Period 13 to Period 24 has been highly stable, representing a summer regime with an average of approximately 305 units per period and low volatility. The most recent observations (Periods 21-24: 317, 313, 352, 277) confirm this stability. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as seen in the arrival messages for orders from Periods 17-20. To set parameters for the OR engine, I will use a recent window of 11 periods (Period 14-24) to capture this stable summer demand regime, which provides sufficient sample size to estimate mean and standard deviation while excluding the earlier May peak. This ensures the base stock calculation (L+1) correctly covers the 5-period risk horizon (current period + 4 period lead time).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. Analyzing the demand for SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) during the summer period (P13-P25), the mean demand is approximately 305 units with a standard deviation of 33. The most recent three periods (P23-P25) have shown demands of 352, 277, and 256, which are consistent with this established summer regime. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P21 order arriving in P25). On-hand inventory is low (42 units), but there is substantial pipeline inventory (1338 units). Given the stability observed since Period 13, I will use a window of the last 13 periods (N=13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the entirety of the current summer demand regime. This will provide a robust estimate of both mean demand and volatility while filtering out the earlier seasonal volatility and high-demand peaks from May.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, reflecting late summer. Demand for trainer socks (item 372860001) has transitioned into a stable late-summer regime. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P18-P26), demand has averaged 298.8 units with a peak of 352 and a low of 256. This is a noticeable shift downward from the spring/early summer levels (~360-430 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P22-P26 arrive exactly 4 periods after ordering). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 1233 units (covering roughly 4 periods of demand). To align with the current stable demand level while monitoring for late-summer volatility, I will use a window of the last 9 periods (N=9) for demand and variance calculation. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80%, which the backend will calculate using my provided parameters.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (Period 18-26) confirmed: average demand ~300 units/period, showing a decrease from the earlier summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in mid-to-late August (Period 28: 2019/08/19). Historical analysis shows a clear transition from high spring/early-summer demand (averaging ~430 in May) to a stable summer regime of ~300 units per period starting around Period 18. The last five periods (P23-P27) show demands of [352, 277, 256, 258, 301], yielding a mean of ~289 units. Given we are approaching the end of summer, a slight softening or continued stability at this level is expected. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals throughout the history (e.g., P23 order arrived P27). I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable summer level (~300 units) and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the moderate volatility of this period (std ~35). On-hand inventory is 170 with a significant pipeline of 1086 arriving over the next 4 periods, which aligns with the demand forecast for (L+1)=5 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Historical data for this Women's trainer sock SKU shows a stable demand regime starting around Period 18 (June 10). From Period 18 to Period 28, the average demand is 288.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 28 of the order placed in Period 24. We are currently in the late-summer phase, and demand has remained consistent around 290-300 units for the past 11 periods. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture this stable summer regime for both mu_hat (expected demand over L+1 periods) and sigma_hat (volatility), ensuring the OR backend targets the 80% service level implied by the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, entering the transitional period from summer to autumn. Historically, demand for this trainer sock SKU (372860001) has been stable throughout the summer (Period 13-29). The most recent demand regime (Period 18-29) shows an average demand of approximately 285 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains perfectly consistent based on the 'conclude' messages for Periods 25-29. Inventory is currently well-managed with 298 units on-hand and 1022 in-transit, which covers the expected demand for the next 4-5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stable summer/early-autumn demand profile (covering Periods 18-29) while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable late-summer demand regime. For Period 31 (Sept 9), we look at recent demand from Period 18 onwards. The average demand across Periods 18-30 is approximately 289 units, with very low volatility (standard deviation ~32). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which we confirm through the regular arrival of orders from Periods 22-26 exactly 4 periods after they were placed. Since the demand is stable and entering early autumn (where trainer socks may see a slight decline or continued stability before a seasonal shift), I will use the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This avoids the noise of the higher spring/early summer peaks while maintaining enough history to ensure a reliable estimate for the OR backend's safety stock and replenishment calculations.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable late-summer/early-autumn demand phase. Average demand from Period 23 to 31 is approximately 277 units (std ~34). Current on-hand is 205 and pipeline inventory is 1062 (total 1267). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 1385 units. The current total position (1267) is slightly below the target, indicating a need for a moderate order. Historical lead times consistently confirm the 4-period promise (L=4). I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P23-P31) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific post-peak summer stabilization while preparing for potential early autumn shifts. The backend will compute the order based on this stable 9-period window.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand stabilization (Period 23-31): Average demand ~277 units, showing a slight decrease and stabilization compared to mid-summer. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P33 (Late September). The SKU is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', a staple item likely transitioning from summer to autumn demand. Examining the history, demand has entered a stable plateau. The average demand from Period 23 to Period 32 (last 10 periods) is approximately 284 units (254, 248, 274, 229, 294, 301, 258, 256, 277, 352). This represents a slight downward trend from the high summer period. Period 32 ending on-hand is 256. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 950, which covers about 3.3 periods of demand at the current average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the stabilized late-summer/early-autumn demand regime while filtering out the volatile spring/early-summer peaks. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock based on the current ~284 \u03bc, which covers L+1 (5) periods (~1420 units) minus on-hand and pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019/09/30. The product is trainer socks, which usually see high demand in late spring/early summer and stabilize or decline slightly in autumn. However, Period 33 showed a spike to 405 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (P28-P32 avg ~260). This could be an early autumn outlier or a new shift. On-hand inventory is 139 with 893 in transit. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the spike in P33 and the transition into October, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to include the spike but still weigh it against the stable autumn baseline (P28-P33 avg: 284). The profit margin is $4.0 vs $1.0 holding cost (q=0.8), suggesting the OR engine should aim for a healthy service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Potential demand spike or regime shift observed in Period 33 (405 units) compared to the stable autumn average of ~260-270 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a transition phase. While the autumn average has been stable around 260-270 units, Period 33 and Period 34 showed higher demand (405 and 312 respectively), which may be indicative of a seasonal shift or marketing event. The current inventory position is very tight: on-hand is only 37 units. However, we have a significant pipeline (1072 units), with 265 units (ordered P31) expected to arrive this period (P35) to replenish the stock. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the P30 order in P34. Given the recent uptick in demand, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend from the last month (P31-P34), where the average demand is ~307 units per period. This protects against the recent spike without overreacting to the single outlier of 405. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for this increased volatility (std dev is ~70). L remains at default (4) as lead times are stable.

Carry-over insight: Early October demand (P33-P34) shows an increase to an average of ~358 units, compared to the September average of ~260, suggesting a potential autumn/winter transition shift.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-October (Period 36). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees transitions as colder weather approaches. Recent demand data (P33-P35: 405, 312, 266) showed a sharp spike followed by a return to moderate levels. The earlier suspicion of a sustained regime shift to ~350+ units is not yet fully confirmed by the most recent 266 observation, which aligns closer to the autumn average of ~260-270. However, the volatility has increased. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (36), but in-transit inventory is high (1232). I will use a recent window of 5 periods (P31-P35) for demand forecasting to capture the recent volatility without overreacting to the P33 spike, resulting in an average of ~300. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Recent demand volatility observed (P33-P35); while P33 was high (405), P35 returned to 266, suggesting the autumn average (~270) is currently holding but with higher variance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a period of high demand volatility as it transitions into late October (autumn/winter). On-hand inventory is at 0, although there are 1386 units in-transit. Historically, demand has averaged around 270 units in the autumn (P23-P32), but recent periods (P33-P34) saw spikes up to 405 units before settling back to 240-260 units. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent shifting average (approx 305 units/period across review+lead time) while accounting for the recent stockout. L remains at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility (std dev) observed in the last few weeks to prevent further stockouts during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: October demand volatility continues; though P36 demand (240) was lower, the stockout suggests the system is underestimating the required base stock for this transition regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) as of the start of Period 38, following two periods of stockouts (P36, P37). The current date is late October, a transition period for nightwear and socks. Despite the stockouts limiting 'sold' amount, observed 'demand' has spiked and settled higher: P33-P37 demand values are [405, 312, 266, 240, 306], averaging ~306 units. This is significantly higher than the previous September-mid October average which hovered around 260-270. Analysis of lead times confirms that orders from P29 to P33 have all arrived exactly at L=4 (e.g., P33 order arrived start of P38). I will set L to 'default' (4), but I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this higher volatility and demand level to recover from the stockout. I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current late-October/early-November regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: October demand shift confirmed. Average demand for P33-P37 is ~306 units (+15% vs prior autumn regime), but with higher volatility. Stockouts in P36-P37 indicate base stock was insufficient for this transition.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), we are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand in October (Periods 34-38) has shown a higher average (~280 units) and increased volatility compared to September, with stockouts in P36 and P37. The Carry-over insight for P38 confirms a regime shift to ~306 units across the wider October window (P33-P37). Although P38's demand was 276, the system needs higher safety stock to account for the demonstrated volatility and transition into the winter season. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am choosing a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=6 to capture the full scope of the October shift (P33-P38) while smoothing the recent high variance. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher volatility observed during this transition, preventing further stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40 (Nov 11, 2019). The carry-over insights indicate a transition period throughout October where demand became more volatile and slightly higher on average (~290-300 units) compared to the stable autumn average (~260-270 units). Recently, demand in P38 and P39 was 276 and 241 respectively, suggesting that the 'spike' may have moderated, but stockouts in P36-P37 indicate we must maintain a robust base stock to handle volatility as we approach the end-of-year sales period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the demand regime appears to have shifted or become more volatile starting around P33, I will use recent_N with N=7 (covering P33-P39) to capture this latest 'Autumn transition' regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend adjust to the slightly higher mean and the increased variance observed in October, ensuring a higher service level during this period of uncertainty.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable late-autumn phase. Demand analysis for the most recent regime (Periods 33-40) shows an average demand of 288.5 units. While there were stockouts in Periods 36 and 37 due to insufficient safety stock during a brief volatility spike (P33 reached 405), demand has since stabilized around 240-276 units in the last three periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the product type (socks) and approaching late November/December, I will use a N=8 window for mu_hat (covering the entire post-September shift) to ensure the base stock accounts for both the recent stability and the earlier peak, providing a buffer against potential pre-holiday demand increases. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to capture the heightened volatility seen in October compared to the very stable summer period.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand stabilization confirmed post-October volatility. Period 33-40 average demand is ~289 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 372860001 (7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks). Current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand shows a stabilization post-October transition. The most recent demand regime (P33-P41) has an average of 278 units per period, but the last three periods (P39-P41) have averaged significantly lower at 234 units, consistent with a pre-winter dip for trainer socks (typically more seasonal to spring/summer/early autumn). For Period 42, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9, covering P33-P41) to capture the post-transition average while acknowledging the recent lower demand levels. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to capture current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P37 arrived in P41). Pipeline inventory (874 units) and on-hand (456 units) are sufficient, but we must maintain order flow to cover the 4-period lead time. Parameters are chosen to ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock that reflects the current slightly decreased demand trend while protecting against the volatility seen in October.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/Pre-winter demand dip observed (P39-P41): average demand decreased to ~234 units from the October average of ~306 units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we observe a significant spike in demand (354 units in P42), contradicting the 'pre-winter dip' theory and instead suggesting a transition into a higher-demand December/holiday regime for these basic socks. Historically, demand for this SKU showed high variance in transition periods (e.g., October). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 283. However, given the Dec 2 calendar date and the 354-unit spike, I will shift to a recent window (N=5) to capture the trend of the last few weeks (avg ~254, but with a recent spike). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (which covers P38-P42) to catch the uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 42 conclude' (P38 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). Sigma_hat will use a wider window (N=10) to account for the transition volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: December/Holiday demand spike observed in P42 (354 units), reversing the brief late-November dip.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019). Historical analysis shows a significant demand spike in Period 42 (354 units), matching expectations for early December holiday shopping for basic socks. However, Period 43 saw a sharp drop to 143 units, likely a localized dip before the peak holiday weeks (mid-to-late Dec). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the product's profile (fine-knit trainer socks) and current date, demand is expected to be volatile but generally higher through the end of the year. The current 'on-hand + in-transit' (413 + 889 = 1302) covers roughly 4.5 periods of the recent average demand (approx 290). To capture the expected holiday variance and shift, I will use recent_N with N=11 to balance the recent volatility (P33-P43 average demand is ~273, but includes both high of 405 and low of 143). This N captures the entire autumn/winter transition period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility observed: Dec P42 spiked to 354 units, followed by P43 dip to 143 units. Expecting higher variance through late December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), representing the heart of the holiday season for this SKU (trainer socks). Demand history shows high volatility in December: P42 spiked to 354, followed by a dip to 143 (P43) and a return toward average at 209 (P44). Carry-over insights suggest that while late autumn averaged ~289, December demand is characterized by higher variance. Current on-hand is 401, with 890 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the volatility (P42: 354, P43: 143, P44: 209), the recent_N method with N=3 captures the most immediate seasonal fluctuations. Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) reflects the average of these holiday-impacted weeks (~235/period), and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat will capture the high holiday variance to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for potential late-December spikes.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (December) confirmed high volatility: P42-P44 demands saw a 147% spread (143 to 354). Average demand remains within 230-290 range but requires higher safety stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019. We are in the heart of the holiday demand season. Recent demand observations for December (P42-P45) show significant volatility: 354, 143, 209, 231 (Average: 234.25). While the average is lower than the October peak, the stockouts in October and the erratic nature of holiday shopping justify maintaining a robust base stock. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P41 order arrived P45). With 393 units on-hand and 756 units in-transit (orders from P42-P45), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the most recent holiday and pre-holiday regime (P38-P45), and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two months. This strategy uses a safety stock buffer to protect against the high variability observed in December demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30). Looking at recent demand patterns: Period 42-46 demands are 354, 143, 209, 231, and 224. While Period 42 showed a significant holiday spike, the post-Christmas and year-end period (P43-P46) has seen a cooling off, averaging approximately 202 units. As we head into January, we typically expect a return to a more stable baseline or a further slight dip as holiday spending concludes. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Currently, we have 341 on-hand and 747 in-transit (P43 order of 297, P44 order of 198, P45 order of 89, and P46 order of 163). To set parameters for the OR engine, I will use recent_N to capture the current post-holiday demand level. I'll select N=5 (covering P42-P46) to balance the high spike of P42 with the lower recent observations, acknowledging the volatility described in Carry-over insights, while resetting the sigma_hat to reflect the actual recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling: Period 43-46 average demand settled at ~202 units after the early December spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
