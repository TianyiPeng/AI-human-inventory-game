Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11) for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks). Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Historical demand data shows five periods: [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], with a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of 26.5. There is no lead time history yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time (L=2). Since this is the first decision phase, the goal is to establish a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat is appropriate here as it uses all available historical samples to set the initial baseline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 310 units, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we do not expect them to arrive until Period 3's arrival phase (visible in Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 310 units in transit. Historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] plus the Period 1 demand of 287 shows a stable mean. The product is women's socks, which generally have stable demand but can be influenced by local seasonality. Given the 1-period delay in observability and the 2-period lead time, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~265-270, we need to ensure the pipeline covers this. I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N for demand to capture the most relevant distribution.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/02/25). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that typically sees increased demand as weather warms up. Historical demand showed [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], but recent demand in Period 1 (287) and Period 2 (548) indicates a significant upward shift. The Period 2 demand of 548 is nearly double the recent average, suggesting either a stock-out induced demand spike or early spring seasonality. The actual lead time for the Period 1 order was 1 period (arrived in P2), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, the system is currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 311 units in-transit (ordered in P2, expected in P3 if L=1, or P4 if L=2). To prevent further lost sales during this demand surge, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=3 to capture the recent spike) and set L to the promised 2 periods to remain conservative in the face of high demand, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to cover the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased significantly in Period 2 (548) compared to historical average (~270). Actual lead time for first order was 1 period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Socks) is experiencing a significant demand surge compared to the initial historical mean of ~266. Recent demands are [287, 548, 399], averaging 411 units per period. This suggests a seasonal or trend-based shift. Lead time analysis: Orders from P1 and P2 both arrived in 1 period (L=1), which is shorter than the promised L=2. However, despite these arrivals, we have stocked out for three consecutive periods (ending inventory is 0), indicating the OR backend's default parameters (based on the old mean) are insufficient. I am setting L=1 (explicitly based on history) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime (avg 411). With L=1, the mu_hat will be (1+1)*411 = 822. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (Std Dev of [287, 548, 399] is ~131, so sigma_hat = sqrt(2)*131 \u2248 185). These parameters aim to increase the base stock level to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently 1 period (observed P1->P2, P2->P3). Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean increased from ~266 to ~411 (+54%) starting Period 1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand history shows a clear regime shift from an initial average of ~266 to a significantly higher mean (approx 393 over the last 4 periods). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods) because the backend's default parameters likely under-project this shift. Lead time analysis: Orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived with a lead time of 1 period. However, Period 4 conclude shows 0 arrivals, meaning the order from Period 3 (L=1 expectation) did not arrive. Since the promised lead time is 2, and we've seen 1-period arrivals previously, there's uncertainty; however, we've had no arrivals for Period 4. I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time) to be safe given the recent missing arrival. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime (approx 393/period) while ignoring the much lower pre-game history. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility (287 to 548) in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock to stop the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: confirmed 1-period delivery for P1 and P2, but P3 order (expected P4 if L=1) is delayed or following promised L=2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [287, 548, 399, 338, 252], yielding a mean of 364.8 units/period. The initial demand spike in Period 2 (548) has cooled down, but the recent average remains significantly higher than the pre-game samples (~266). Lead time analysis shows variability: orders from P1 and P2 arrived with L=1, but the P3 order arrived in P5 (L=2). This confirms that while L=1 is possible, the promised L=2 is a safer planning anchor to avoid stockouts. Currently, we have 373 units on-hand and 719 in-transit (orders from P4 and P5). Since P4 (ordered 354) should arrive in P6 (L=2), we are well-positioned. I will set L to the promised 2 periods and use the last 5 periods (the entire game history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift to a higher mean while accounting for the recent cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is variable between 1 and 2 periods (P1, P2 were 1; P3 was 2). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (avg ~365) compared to pre-game data.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees steady demand as spring begins. Historical demands (P1-P6) are [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329], averaging 358.8. The pre-game data averaged 266, confirming a significant shift to a higher demand regime. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P1: 1, P2: 1, P3: 2). The P4 order (354 units) is now overdue if L=1 and expected this period if L=2. The P5 order (365 units) is also in-transit. On-hand inventory is low (44). Given the variability in lead time, I will set L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the pipeline covers a sufficient window. mu_hat will use the recent 6 periods (the current game regime) to reflect the stabilized higher demand (avg ~359). sigma_hat will also be based on the recent 6 periods to capture the observed volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st. Historically, demand for socks (fine-knit trainer socks) tends to see a slight uptick in early spring. Recent demand history (Periods 1-7) shows a mean of approximately 367 units, which is higher than the pre-game average of 266. Specifically, demand in the last 7 periods was: 287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415. Excluding the outlier of 548, the mean remains around 340-360. We are currently out of stock (Ending On-hand: 0). There is a significant amount in-transit (1186 units), consisting of orders from P4 (354), P6 (173), and P7 (294), and P8 will order based on the new parameters. Lead time history shows variation: P1 (L=1), P2 (L=1), P3 (L=2). Since the order from P4 is now 4 periods old (placed P4, currently P8 start) and hasn't arrived, it is likely lost or significantly delayed. Given this lead-time uncertainty (1 to 2+ periods) and the stockout, I am setting L=2 (promised) to ensure the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock for 3 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the current game.

Carry-over insight: P4 order (354 units) is likely lost; it has not arrived by Period 8 (expected P5 or P6). Demand remains stabilized in a higher regime (~367) compared to pre-game data (~266).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Demand remains in a higher regime than the pre-game history; the average demand across the last 8 periods is 369 units, compared to the initial 266. Regarding lead times: P1 and P2 arrived in 1 period, P3 in 2 periods, P4 is confirmed lost (ordered P4, not arrived by P8), P5 arrived in 3 periods, P6 in 2 periods, and P7 in 1 period. This indicates high lead-time volatility (1-3 periods). Current on-hand is 450 units. In-transit is 412 units (P8 order: 58 units, and P4 order: 354 units which is likely lost). I will set L to 2 (promised) to account for the observed volatility. mu_hat will use recent_N=8 to capture the current demand regime (~369/period). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to capture the increased volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: P4 shipment (354 units) is confirmed lost (ordered P4, current P9, max observed lead time is 3). Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) is currently in a stabilized high-demand regime following an early season shift. The mean demand since Period 1 is approximately 363 units per period (standard deviation ~85), significantly higher than the pre-game data (~266). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1:1, P2:1, P3:2, P5:3, P6:2, P7:1). Crucially, the order from Period 4 (354 units) is confirmed lost as it has not arrived after 5 periods. There is currently 128 units on-hand and 436 units in-transit (P8: 58, P9: 378). Given the loss of the P4 shipment and the ongoing volatility, I will set L to the promised lead time of 2 as a baseline for the OR engine, while using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the sustained higher demand regime and its associated variance since the game started. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand level and the supply uncertainty caused by the lost shipment.

The SKU 372860001 (Women's Socks) is currently in a state of high lead-time volatility and stockouts. Recent history shows demand has stabilized at a higher regime compared to the pre-game data (mean ~358 over the last 10 periods). The 'promised' lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have fluctuated wildly between 1 and 3 periods, with the Period 4 order (354 units) officially considered lost. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) consists of orders from P8 (58), P9 (378), and P10 (300), totaling 736 units. The P8 order (ordered 3 periods ago) is overdue given the max observed lead time of 3. To compensate for lead-time uncertainty and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 3 (the max observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high: observed arrivals at 1, 2, and 3 periods. P8 order (58 units) is currently late (3 periods elapsed). Demand regime since P1 remains consistently higher than pre-game (avg ~358 vs 266).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019/4/29). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for trainer socks remains high and steady in the new regime (avg ~358 since Period 1). The 'In-transit' figure of 1195 units accounts for orders from P4 (354 units, confirmed lost), P8 (58 units, overdue), P10 (300 units), and P11 (483 units). Excluding the lost P4 shipment, the active pipeline is 841 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with P8 now at L=4 (likely delayed or lost). Given the high demand and stockouts in Periods 10 and 11, I will use L=3 to account for the observed upper bound of lead-time variability. I am using recent_N=11 (all game periods) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand level (~360/period) compared to pre-game data, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect more recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P8 order (58 units) is now 4 periods late (ordered P8, current P12), suggesting increasing lead-time instability or a second lost shipment.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Basic Trainer Socks) is experiencing significant lead-time instability and stockouts. Period 13 is early May. Historically, since Period 1, demand has shifted to a higher regime (avg ~363 vs pre-game ~266). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with two likely lost shipments (Order P4, 354 units, and Order P8, 58 units). The on-hand inventory is 0. Currently, 1548 units are 'In-transit', but this includes the lost orders from P4 and P8 (412 units total), leaving a real pipeline of 1136 units (Orders P10, P11, P12). Because the backend OR engine is unaware of lost shipments, it will overcount pipeline inventory and under-order. To compensate for the lost 412 units and the lead-time volatility, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to increase the safety stock buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the sustained higher demand regime since Period 1 (avg ~363) while smoothing recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Second lost shipment confirmed: Order P8 (58 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (ordered P8, current P12, max observed L=3). Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 412.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees steady demand in late spring (May). The current demand regime has stabilized at an average of approximately 353 units per period since Period 1, which is significantly higher than the pre-game data. Inventory management is currently hindered by stockouts (on-hand is 0) and high lead-time volatility. Lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods, and two shipments (P4 and P8) are confirmed lost. The current in-transit pipeline (1619 units) is very high because multiple recent orders (P10, P11, P12, P13) have not arrived yet. Given that the maximum observed successful lead time is 3 periods, I expect P10 (ordered P10, now P14) to arrive during this period's resolution. I will set L to 2 (the promised value and close to the historical average) to avoid over-ordering through the pipeline cap. I use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=13 to capture the higher post-Period 1 regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility seen in the game history.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 15, May 20th. Product is trainer socks. Demand is in a sustained higher regime since Period 1, averaging ~365 units per period. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with two confirmed lost shipments (P4 and P8). The pipeline inventory is currently high (1266 units), but includes the lost P4 (354) and P8 (58) units, totaling 412 lost units that the OR backend will incorrectly count as coming in-transit. To compensate for these 'ghost' units and ensure the base stock calculation triggers an order if needed, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock using a lead time of 2. Recent demand (P11-P14) average is ~352. Target base stock = (L+1) * mu * safety_factor. Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), q=0.8, z=0.84. Target Base Stock \u2248 3 * 365 + 0.84 * (sqrt(3) * 60) \u2248 1182. However, with 1266 in-transit (854 real) and 78 on-hand, the backend sees 1344 total. To ensure it maintains availability despite the 412 missing units, I set mu_hat to 420 (approx (1+L)*365 + lost units buffer/3) to force the order logic to account for the gap.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late May 2019. This SKU (Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks) has transitioned into a higher demand regime since Period 1, with a mean demand of approximately 358 units compared to the pre-game average of 266. Recent demand remains consistent with this higher regime (average of last 5 periods: 351). Inventory management is currently challenging due to lead-time instability and lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P4 (354 units) and P8 (58 units) are confirmed lost. The current on-hand inventory is 0. There are 1,266 units in-transit, but this includes the 412 lost units, leaving an effective pipeline of 854 units (Orders P10, P11, P13). Lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods. To account for this volatility and the previous stockouts, I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time, which aligns with the median observed performance) and use a recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand regime while ignoring the pre-game data. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=15) to capture the increased volatility of the current regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are managing a high-demand item (Fine-knit trainer socks) that has experienced significant supply chain instability. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 1, with a recent average (Periods 11-16) of approximately 371 units per period. The supply chain has two confirmed lost shipments (P4: 354 units and P8: 58 units), totaling 412 units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes are in-transit. To compensate for these lost units and the high lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods), I am setting the lead time L to 'explicit' at 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers a wider window. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 (Periods 11-16) to capture the current demand level of ~371/period. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the recent demand volatility. By setting L to 3, the OR backend's base stock calculation (covering L+1 periods) will target ~1484 units, effectively neutralizing the 412 lost units and aiming to restore on-hand availability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), demand for trainer socks remains in a stable regime with a long-term average of ~353 units and a recent 5-period average of 311 units. The primary challenge is the 'pipeline inventory' calculation. The system reports 1,540 units in transit, but analysis confirms that 1,266 of these are lost or extremely overdue: P4 (354), P8 (58), P10 (300), P11 (483), and P13 (71). Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this 'ghost' inventory. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered to meet upcoming demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock as: (1+L) * Mean + Pipeline_Offset. With L=2 (promised), mean=350, and 1,266 lost units, a value of ~2,350 is required to signal a replenishment of ~300-400 units (2350 - 1540 - 0 on hand - 274 recent order = ~536 target order).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost shipments now include: P4 (354), P8 (58), P10 (300), P11 (483), and P13 (71). Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline: 1,266 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19 (June 17). Product is trainer socks, showing steady demand (avg ~350 units/period since Period 1). The critical issue is the 'In-transit' pipeline of 2,149 units, which includes 1,266 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13). The OR backend subtracts the full 2,149 from the base stock. To compensate for this 1,266-unit deficit and prevent continued stockouts, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Recent avg demand is ~350. With L=2, the base stock (1+L)*350 = 1,050. To offset the 1,266 ghost units, the mu_hat must be increased significantly. I will set mu_hat to 2,600 (approx (3 * 350) + 1266 + safety buffer). L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals show volatility between 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to maintain a high service level given the history of stockouts.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', a staple item. Demand has been stable in a high regime since Period 1, with a mean of approximately 352 units/period (post-Period 1 avg). The primary challenge is extreme lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and a high frequency of lost shipments. Historically, orders from P4, P8, P10, P11, and P13 are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 1,266 'ghost' units in the pipeline (In-transit: 2727). Actual pipeline inventory that is likely to arrive consists of P18 (883 units) and P19 (578 units). To account for the 'ghost' inventory which suppresses new orders in the OR backend (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the L and mu_hat parameters. I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to extend the protection period. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating it as (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory. Mean demand is ~350, so (1+3)*350 + 1266 = 2666. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=19) to capture the volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) has reached 1,266 units (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods.

Current date is 2019/7/1 (Period 21). The product is trainer socks, which show stable demand in the current regime (post-P1 mean ~355 units). Historical data confirms a significant number of lost shipments (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13 totaling 1,266 units), which are still artificially inflating the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P18) taking 2 periods. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' L to ensure the backend projects enough safety stock over the risk window, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=20, covering the stable higher-demand regime since P1). Most importantly, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline inventory issue: since the OR backend uses 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline is inflated by 1,266 lost units, I must provide a mu_hat value that essentially adds back those lost units to the base stock calculation, or use parameters that trick the backend into ordering. However, given on-hand is currently 594 and demand is ~350, we have coverage for the immediate period. To force the engine to recognize the need for new stock despite the ghost pipeline, I set L=3 (max observed) and mu_hat to a value reflecting the expected demand plus a buffer for the lost units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has stabilized in a regime with a mean of approximately 342 units over the last 10 periods (N=10), showing no significant summer seasonality spike yet. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 855 units. However, the system faces a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. Out of the 1,630 units reported as 'In-transit', 1,266 units are from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 8, 10, 11, 13). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; if I don't compensate for these 1,266 'ghost' units, the backend will under-order or stop ordering entirely. Since I cannot directly clear the pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target base stock. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With an average lead time of 2, (L+1)=3. Target = (342 * 3) + (1.65 * 50 * sqrt(3)) \u2248 1,168 units. To force an order despite 1,266 ghost units and 855 on-hand, the 'virtual' base stock must exceed 2,121. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand plus the lost inventory to bridge the gap created by the OR engine's logic. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P17, P18, P19) show a return to the 1-2 period range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Socks' remains stable within a high regime established since Period 1, with a recent average (Periods 17-22) of approximately 307 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 605 units, which is healthy. However, the 'in-transit' figure of 1,567 units is highly inflated due to 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P4 (354), P8 (58), P10 (300), P11 (483), and P13 (71) totaling 1,266 units are considered lost. Subtracting these from the total in-transit (1567 - 1266) leaves a real pipeline of 301 units (the order from P21). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting L to 2 (the promised and most frequent lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * expected_demand. With L=2 and expected_demand=307, mu_hat = 3 * 307 = 921. For sigma_hat, I use the 'recent_N' method (N=6) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early regime jump.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see stable demand in summer. Historical demand since Period 1 has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 342 units per period (last 10 periods). Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a mode of 2. A critical factor is the 'ghost inventory': there are 1,266 units in-transit that are confirmed lost (from orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13). The backend OR engine sees a total in-transit of 1,567, but only 301 units (ordered P21) are actually likely to arrive. To compensate for this 1,266-unit gap in the pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual expected demand. Using an explicit mu_hat: (Expected demand per period ~340) * (L+1=3) + 1266 = 2286. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to the promised 2 periods as most recent arrivals (P18-P20) followed L=2.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a stable year-round item. The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand remains stable in the higher regime established since Period 1, with recent demands (P19-P24) averaging 313.6 units, slightly lower than the overall game average of ~350 but consistent. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P18-P20 all arrived with lead_time=2). A significant issue is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P4, P8, P10, P11, and P13 totaling 1,266 units. Additionally, the P21 order (301 units) is now at lead_time=4, suggesting it might also be lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 2079 includes these 1,567 units of likely lost stock. To compensate and ensure the backend actually orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must set L to an explicit high value to increase the base stock and mu_hat to account for the actual demand needs. Setting L to 3 reflects the maximum observed successful lead time, while mu_hat uses the recent demand average to avoid over-ordering as we move past peak summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order P21 (301 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (ordered P21, current P25), bringing total confirmed ghost inventory to 1,567 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Demand for trainer socks remains stable in a high regime (average ~320 units/period since Period 13). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. The total in-transit quantity is 2,079 units, but a significant portion is confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, and now P21), totaling 1,567 units. This means the 'real' pipeline is only 512 units (from the order in Period 24). Since P24 was ordered 2 periods ago and the average lead time is ~2 periods, we expect those 512 units to arrive very soon. However, to account for the high rate of lost shipments and the 1,567 'ghost' units distorting the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I will use an 'explicit' L to signal that we need a larger base stock, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=13) to capture the current stable demand level (avg ~318). I will set L to 4 to force the engine to look further ahead and potentially place a replenishment order despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order P21 (301 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (ordered P21, current P25). Total confirmed ghost inventory reached 1,567 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Socks) is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand has stabilized in a regime of ~315 units/period over the last 10 periods, though it was higher earlier. The primary challenge is the extreme 'ghost' inventory: out of 2,079 units in-transit, 1,567 units are confirmed lost across multiple periods (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21), meaning the functional pipeline is only 512 units (from the P24 order). The P24 order (512 units) was placed with a promised L=2, so it should have arrived in P26 but is currently slightly delayed or following the 3-period lead time seen previously. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including lost units) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the target stock level to account for the 1,567 lost units. Target base stock = ((L+1) * mean_demand) + lost_units + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=315, and 1,567 lost units, target is approximately (3*315) + 1567 + 200 = 2712. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that forces an order despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 28 (late August 2019). Demand for this SKU (fine-knit trainer socks) has remained stable within a higher regime (avg ~320-350) compared to the pre-game data, despite periodic stockouts. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' pipeline of 2079 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P4 (354), P8 (58), P10 (300), P11 (483), P13 (71), and P21 (301) are confirmed lost based on the 4+ period delay logic (max observed L=3). This totals 1,567 lost units. Only the P24 order (512 units) is currently viable. To fix the pipeline under-ordering caused by the OR engine's 'inventory minus pipeline' logic, I will use an 'explicit' L to account for volatility and 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure a substantial order is triggered to clear the stockout, effectively bypassing the ghost inventory's dampening effect.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26 (Period 29). Demand for this SKU (Socks) has remained stable within a higher regime of approximately 300-350 units since Period 1. The primary challenge is extreme lead-time volatility and frequent lost shipments. Orders from P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, and P21 are confirmed lost, totaling 1,567 'ghost' units in the pipeline that will never arrive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 2,079 includes these 1,567 ghost units, leaving only 512 units (from P24) as viable pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including ghosts) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target inventory levels to compensate for the 1,567 units that will never arrive, essentially forcing an order. I estimate a 3-period demand (L+1) at ~1000 units, but must add the 1,567 lost units to the target so the backend (1000 + 1567 - 2079) actually places an order for the needed ~500 units to cover upcoming demand and restock.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost (ghost) inventory reached 1,567 units (Orders: P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21). All 'In-transit' values must be discounted by this amount when setting explicit targets.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), demand for this SKU (trainer socks) has stabilized into a post-peak regime with an average of approximately 270 units per period over the last 5 weeks (Periods 25-29). The cumulative 'ghost' inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1,567 units (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21). The current 'In-transit' report of 2,613 units is misleading because 1,567 of those units will never arrive. The actual viable pipeline is 2,613 - 1,567 = 1,046 units. These viable units are from recent orders P24 (512 units) and P29 (534 units). Since lead time is volatile (1-3 periods), order P24 is now 6 periods old and potentially lost, but I will wait one more period before confirming. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for variability, and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * 270 = 1,080. Given the high ghost inventory, I must ensure the backend attempts to reach a base stock that covers the viable pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 2,600 (approx. 1,080 + 1,567) 'tricks' the backend into ignoring the 1,567 units of ghost inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for these cotton-blend trainer socks has remained relatively stable in a higher regime (averaging ~320 units/period since Period 1) compared to the initial pre-game data. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. Historical analysis confirms a 'ghost inventory' of 1,567 units (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, and P21) that are lost and will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' of 2,660 units is misleading; after subtracting the 1,567 ghost units, the actual physical pipeline is 1,093 units (representing orders from P24 onwards). Lead times vary between 1-3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the actual demand despite the pipeline inflation, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the upper end of the volatile lead time. I am using 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat to capture the sustained demand average of ~315-320 units per period. For sigma_hat, I use N=15 to capture the recent volatility. This setup helps the backend compute a base stock that accounts for the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has remained relatively stable in a higher regime (averaging ~292 over the last 10 periods) compared to the initial pre-game data, though it has slightly softened from the peak seen earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is 327. The 'In-transit' figure of 2079 is heavily inflated by 1,567 units of confirmed lost inventory (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21), leaving an effective pipeline of 512 units (matching the P24 order). The P24 order (512 units) is now 8 periods old, which is significantly beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, strongly suggesting it is also lost. If P24 is lost, the actual pipeline is 0. To protect against stockouts given the high lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and the risk of lost shipments, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) to capture the current stable-but-elevated mean (~292) and 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed performance. The OR backend will see the massive (mostly ghost) In-transit and likely order 0, but by identifying the ghost inventory in carry-over insights, we maintain the record that actual replenishment is failing.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order P24 (512 units) has not arrived after 8 periods (ordered P24, current P32), bringing total confirmed ghost inventory to 2,079 units. The entire 'In-transit' balance is now comprised of lost shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in Period 33. Demand has been stable at a slightly lower regime recently, with the last 4 periods averaging 251 units (P29-P32). On-hand inventory is currently 79 units. The in-transit balance of 2,079 units is confirmed as entirely 'ghost' inventory (lost shipments from Periods 4, 8, 10, 11, 13, 21, and 24) based on the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods being far exceeded. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Lead time has been 1-2 periods for the most recent arrivals (P29 arrived in 2, P30 in 1). I will set L to the promised 2 periods to be safe. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will subtract the 2,079 ghost units from any calculated base stock, resulting in zero orders if using default methods, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1) at the recent average of ~255 units, plus a safety buffer. Target base stock = 255 * 3 + 1.64 * (std dev * sqrt(3)). Recent std dev is approx 20. Target \u2248 765 + 56 = 821. To force the OR backend to order despite the 2,079 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock plus the ghost inventory (821 + 2079 = 2900).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30), we are entering the autumn season. Demand has recently spiked to 405 (Period 33) from a previous average of ~260-280 in the preceding four periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 2,858 units is heavily inflated by 2,079 units of confirmed lost (ghost) inventory (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24). The real active pipeline consists of only 779 units ordered in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0. With a lead time typically between 1-3 periods, the order from Period 33 might arrive in Period 34 or 35. To avoid stockouts during this autumn demand shift and to correct for the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the recent spike) and L=3 to account for the upper bound of observed lead time volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (2,858) from its base_stock calculation, and only 779 units are 'real', I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset the ~2,079 unit ghost inventory deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=2/3) should be ~1200-1400 units. To make the OR backend order sufficient units despite the 2,858 ghost units, I will set an explicit mu_hat that forces the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger the cap or a meaningful order.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/7), the current demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Socks' is moving into the autumn/pre-holiday season. Recent demand has spiked from a late-summer average of ~250 to a recent mean of 358 (Periods 33-34), likely reflecting seasonal stock-up behavior. The lead-time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival (P33 order) arriving in 1 period, while historical data shows a range of 1 to 3 periods and significant loss issues. In-transit inventory is listed as 2824 units, but based on carry-over insights, 2079 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24). The 'active' pipeline is approximately 745 units (from P34). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period window despite the 'ghost' inventory, I am using 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the promised/average timing and 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1+L) * 350 = 1050. This target ensures the capped policy (base stock - pipeline) triggers an order because the pipeline (745 active) + on-hand (467) = 1212 is close to the safety stock requirement for the upcoming demand period, while discounting the 2079 lost units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th. Demand for these cotton-blend trainer socks has remained relatively stable in the most recent regime (Periods 29-35), with an average demand of approximately 284 units. However, looking at the full history since Period 1, the mean is approximately 324. Lead time continues to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (e.g., P33 arrived in 1 period, while others take 2). A critical issue is the 'ghost' inventory: out of 2,824 units in-transit, 2,079 are confirmed lost (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24). This leaves an actual pipeline of 745 units (Order P34), which is expected to arrive in Period 36 (this period). With on-hand inventory at 201 and an expected arrival of 745, we will have ~946 units to cover Period 36 and 37 demand. Given the OR backend's inability to discount lost shipments, I will use 'explicit' values to target a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand while bypassing the 'In-transit' bloat. I am setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat = (1+2)*325 = 975 to maintain a safe service level during the lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 2824 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on the carry-over insights, at least 2,079 units are confirmed lost (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24). Subtracting these from the 2,824 in-transit leaves 745 units, which exactly matches the order placed in Period 34. Since the current date is Period 37, this order (P34) is now 3 periods late (expected 1-2). Given the extreme unreliability and the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will set an explicit 'mu_hat' to force a replenishment order. The demand regime has stabilized around 300-350 units. I'll target a base stock level that covers 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at approximately 330 units/period (~990 total). Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory, and only 745 units are realistically in transit, I need to account for the ~2100 ghost units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that ensures an order is triggered despite the ghost inventory blocking the capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Current 'In-transit' balance of 2824 units is composed of 2079 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory and 745 units from Period 34 which is currently 3 periods late. Effective pipeline inventory is only 745 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand is entering a seasonal period for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' (Womens Nightwear/Socks) as colder weather approaches. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 284 units, showing stability after the high-demand summer regime. The most critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 3175 units. Historical tracking shows 2079 units are confirmed lost (ghost inventory from P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24). The order from P34 (745 units) is now 4 periods late (current P38), which is highly suspicious given the max observed lead time of 3, but I will not declare it lost until it hits 5 periods late to avoid under-ordering. This leaves an effective pipeline of 745 (P34) + 351 (P37) = 1096 units. To compensate for the 2079 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly counts as available stock, I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I target a base stock covering (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods * 300 units = 900) plus the 2079 ghost units to force the OR engine to place an order. Targeted mu_hat = (285 * 3) + 2079 = 2934.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory reconciled: 2079 units are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory. Period 34 order (745 units) is now 4 periods late and nearing 'lost' status.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4, 2019), the 'In-transit' balance of 3,175 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms 2,079 units are definitely lost (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24). Furthermore, the order from Period 34 (745 units) is now 5 periods late (current P39 minus order P34), which is 2 periods beyond the maximum observed successful lead time of 3. This strongly suggests the P34 order is also lost, bringing the total 'ghost' inventory to 2,824 units. The only potentially viable order in the pipeline is from Period 37 (351 units), which is currently at a lead time of 2 (normal). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for trainer socks in November is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as colder weather sets in, though historical data shows a consistent regime around 300-350 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I will use the 'explicit' method to set targets that account for the 2,824 lost units. I'll set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) at an average demand of 310, plus an 'explicit' buffer to offset the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order P34 (745 units) is now 5 periods late, bringing total confirmed ghost inventory to 2,824 units. Effective pipeline inventory as of Period 39 is only 351 units (from P37).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-11. We are entering the mid-November period where demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' typically remains stable before a potential holiday peak. However, the primary issue is the inventory pipeline. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 3,829 units is largely comprised of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on the Carry-over Insights, we have confirmed losses of 2,824 units (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24, and P34). The remaining 'real' pipeline consists of Order P37 (351 units, 3 periods old) and Order P39 (654 units, 1 period old). Lead times are volatile, spanning 1 to 3 periods, with recent arrivals occurring at 1-2 periods. I am setting L=2 (promised) as it remains a reasonable expectation despite the losses. For mu_hat, the demand regime has been stable around a mean of 278 units over the last 10 periods (P30-P39); I will use recent_N=10 to capture this. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to account for recent volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 3,829 in-transit units from the base stock; since the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods will be approximately 834, the engine will order 0 unless I adjust. However, because the system 'In-transit' includes 2,824 lost units, the OR backend is blind to the fact that we are actually stock-out. To force an order that covers the next 3 periods of demand while ignoring the ghost inventory, I use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Expected demand for 3 periods (L+1) is ~834. I will set mu_hat to 4663 (calculated as 3829 existing in-transit + 834 required) to ensure the OR engine places an order for approximately 834 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the inventory position is significantly overstocked relative to the remaining 6 periods of the game. Total on-hand inventory is 753 units, and effective pipeline inventory is 907 units (the order from P40). The remaining demand is estimated at ~270 units per period, totaling approximately 1,620 units until the end of the simulation. Our current effective total of 1,660 units is sufficient. The 'In-transit' balance of 3,731 units contains 2,824 units of confirmed ghost inventory (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24, and now P34 which is 7 periods late). Because the OR backend perceives these 2,824 ghost units as real inventory, it will naturally calculate a negative order quantity (and thus order 0), which is the desired outcome given our current overstock. I will use recent demand (N=7) to calibrate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default lead time, allowing the system to bleed down the existing stock without placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order P34 (745 units) is now 7 periods late, bringing total confirmed ghost inventory to 2,824 units. Total 'In-transit' balance is effectively only 907 units (P40 order).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019). Current on-hand is 543 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 3731 units is significantly inflated by historical 'ghost' inventory. Based on history, the confirmed lost orders are: P4(354), P8(58), P10(300), P11(483), P13(71), P21(301), P24(512), and now P34(745), totaling 2824 units. The remaining 907 units in transit are from Period 40 (only 2 periods old), which are still within the volatile lead-time window (1-3 periods). Thus, the effective pipeline is 907. Demand in the most recent regime (last 10 periods) has averaged ~275, with a standard deviation of ~53. As we are approaching late November/December, there is potential for a seasonal lift in sock sales for the holidays, although recent demand has been stable or slightly declining. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand based on the recent 10-period average. Sigma_hat is set to account for recent volatility. I use explicit lead time L=2 to reflect the promised value, as recent arrivals (P37, P39) arrived in 3 and 1 periods respectively, averaging 2.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order P34 (745 units) is now 8 periods late and is considered lost. Total confirmed ghost inventory in the 'In-transit' balance is 2824 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). The product is trainer socks. We are entering the peak holiday season in December, where demand for basic soft-goods like socks typically increases due to gifting and colder weather. Looking at the history, demand has fluctuated between 210 and 354 in the last few periods. However, we must account for the high rate of lost shipments. The 'In-transit' balance is 3731. Based on Carry-over Insights, 2824 units are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). This leaves 907 units (ordered in Period 40) as the only viable pipeline inventory. Since Period 40's order is now 3 periods old (L=3), it should arrive during Period 43. Current on-hand is 189. Total effective inventory (on-hand 189 + viable in-transit 907) is 1096. To prepare for the December seasonal spike, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1100 (anticipating ~366 demand per period for L+1=3 periods) and set L to 2 (promised) to ensure the OR engine maintains a healthy base stock despite the lead time volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to buffer against both demand spikes and arrival uncertainty.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019), the system has 953 units on-hand. The current 'In-transit' balance of 2,824 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24, P34), as identified in previous carry-over insights. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has recently softened (last 3 periods: 210, 354, 143; avg ~236) compared to the earlier regime (~350). Given the product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', we are entering the winter season where demand for trainer socks may decrease or fluctuate. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent demand cooling. To account for the highly volatile lead time (1-3 periods) and to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering due to the high (but fake) 'In-transit' figure, I will set L=3 explicitly. This reflects the maximum observed successful lead time, ensuring the base stock calculation covers a safer window while the capped policy prevents excessive ordering.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for trainer socks (372860001) has softened recently, with the last 5 periods (P40-P44) averaging 233.6 units, compared to the overall game average of ~310. The calendar date (2019/12/16) suggests we are past the peak buying period for this SKU and likely entering a post-holiday slowdown. Lead times remain highly volatile (ranging 1-3 periods). Most importantly, the 'In-transit' balance of 2,824 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24, and P34), as documented in the Carry-over Insights. With 744 units on hand and 0 units actually in transit, and only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), our current stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~700 units (3 periods * 233 units/period) until the end of the game. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs. I will set parameters to ensure a zero order by using the current demand regime and acknowledging that there is no effective pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), which is the peak holiday season for socks. Demand in the most recent periods (P41-P45) has been relatively low (avg ~230) compared to the higher regime observed earlier in the year (~360), likely due to stock-outs or shifts in consumer behavior. However, the 'In-transit' balance of 2,824 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (Orders P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24, P34), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With on-hand inventory at 513 units and demand expected to potentially rise post-holiday or stay at current levels, a new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover current demand (~230) multiplied by (1+L) while discounting the ghost inventory. Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target, effectively neutralizing the 2,824 units of ghost inventory. I'll target a base stock of approx 3,500 (Ghost 2824 + ~700 safety/cycle stock).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has been 354, 143, 209, 231, and 224, showing a slight decrease compared to the earlier regime average (~350), with a recent average of ~232. This may be a post-holiday dip or a new lower regime. The 'In-transit' balance of 3070 units is heavily inflated by 2824 units of confirmed lost inventory (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P24, P34). The only 'live' order is from P46 (246 units). On-hand inventory is 289. Therefore, effective pipeline (on-hand + valid in-transit) is 289 + 246 = 535 units. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Since L is volatile (1-3 periods), I use L=2 (promised). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly despite the 2824 'ghost' units in its pipeline calculation, I must set mu_hat high enough or use an explicit value to force an order if needed. However, given effective pipeline (535) vs demand (~232/period), we have roughly 2.3 periods of cover. With L=2, (L+1)=3. We might need a small top-up. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the lower demand trend and sigma_hat to capture the volatility.
