Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks). The historical demand for the past 5 periods is [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], which averages 266.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 26.3. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0, an immediate order is necessary to cover demand during the promised lead time (L=4). Using the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate parameters based on the full 5-period history, providing a stable baseline for the start of the simulation. No seasonality or lead-time shifts are yet observable.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 310 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, this shipment is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 5. The historical demand for this SKU (Womens trainer socks) is [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287]. Current demand (287) is consistent with the recent moving average of approximately 270 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant demand of 287, we experienced lost sales in Period 1. I will set parameters based on the recent 5 samples (P1 demand + the 5 provided past samples, totaling 6) to capture the current demand level. L remains at the promised value of 4 as we have no data yet to suggest otherwise. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods (approx 1350 units), minus the 310 already in transit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Evaluation of history: Demand is significantly higher than the initial historical data ([231, 255, 302, 272, 272]) provided in the prompt. Period 1 demand was 287, and Period 2 saw a spike to 548. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order placed in Period 1 (310 units) is expected to arrive at the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 617 units (310 from P1 + 307 from P2). Because of the stockout (ending inventory 0 in P1 and P2), demand is likely lost. The product (Womens Socks) and date (late February) don't suggest an obvious seasonal peak, but the recent demand jump to 548 suggests a regime shift or high volatility. I will use recent_N=2 to capture this elevated demand mean for mu_hat (avg of 287 and 548 = 417.5 per period). Since L=4, mu_hat becomes (1+4)*417.5 = 2087.5. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=2 to reflect the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 2: demand increased from historical avg ~266 to 548 (+100%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No arrivals have occurred yet as the promised lead time (L) is 4. The first order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during this period (Period 4) and will be visible at the start of Period 5. Demand has shown a significant shift: P1 was 287 (near historical average), but P2 jumped to 548, and P3 was 399. The average of the last three periods (P1-P3) is 411.3, which is significantly higher than the initial historical data. Because the system is currently stock-out (on-hand is 0) and the pipeline (1339) is meant to cover (L+1) periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new elevated demand level. L remains default (4). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed in the recent demand spikes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) has a promised lead time (L) of 4. Orders placed in Period 1 (310 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 arrival resolution; however, because arrivals occur after our decision and are only confirmed in the 'conclude' message, we have not seen any arrivals yet. Historical demand shows a significant spike in P2 (548), followed by P3 (399) and P4 (338). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P2-P4) is 428.3, which is significantly higher than the initial historical average (~266). Given the transition to spring (March 11), demand for trainer socks may remain elevated compared to winter months. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility. Lead time (L) is kept at the default promised value of 4, as no orders have reached their expected delivery window yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2: Average demand increased from ~266 to ~428 (+60%) over last 3 periods, likely due to seasonal transition to spring for trainer socks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18, 2019). The product is trainer socks, which are transitioning into their peak spring/summer season. Demand history shows a significant spike in Period 2 (548) followed by a cooling but still elevated period average compared to the initial historical seed of ~266. The last 4 periods (P2-P5) average 384 units/period. The first order from Period 1 (310 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (58), but there is a massive pipeline of 2035 units. Given L=4, my parameters need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent demand regime (last 4 samples, avg 384), the target base stock (mu_hat) should be approximately 384 * 5 = 1920. Since in-transit is 2035, the OR backend will likely order 0 or very little (subject to the safety stock z*sigma calculation). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current seasonal demand level for both mean and volatility, and stick to the promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a seasonal demand spike as spring approaches. Historical demand suggests a significant increase starting Period 2, with an average of approximately 373 units over the last 5 periods (P2-P6), compared to the initial historical mean of ~266. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on deliveries in Period 5 and 6 (orders from P1 and P2). The current on-hand inventory is low (36 units), but there is a substantial pipeline of 1791 units (P3: 722, P4: 627, P5: 379, P6: 63). These should begin arriving in Period 7 (the order from P3). To balance the seasonal shift while accounting for the high pipeline, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher spring demand level (approx 373/period * 5 periods = 1865). Lead time remains at the default (promised 4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (April 1st), we are managing '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Current demand data [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415] confirms a seasonal shift that occurred around Period 2, likely due to spring weather increasing demand for no-show/trainer socks. The last 3 periods (P5-P7) show an average demand of ~332 units, while the full history since the shift (P2-P7) averages ~380 units. Lead times for the first three orders (P1, P2, P3) have all consistently been 4 periods as promised. With 343 units on hand and 1317 in-transit (P4, P5, P6, P7 orders), we are well-positioned for the current demand level. To ensure the OR engine captures the recent seasonal demand level without overreacting to the single P2 spike, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (covering the post-shift period) and default lead time settings.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see increased demand as spring progresses into summer. Historical demand (Periods 1-8) averages ~369, but has varitied between ~250 and ~550. My earlier insight (Period 5) noted a seasonal increase. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, and 8 concludes). Inventory is moderately high (On-hand: 588, In-transit: 1121), which covers approximately 4.6 periods of average demand. Since the lead time is 4, (L+1) is 5. Using recent_N (N=7 to capture the post-initial-spike equilibrium) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will adapt to the seasonal trend while smoothing the volatility of the Period 2 spike. 'L' remains at default as the promised lead time (4) matches the actual data perfectly.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see increased demand as spring progresses (April/May). Recent history (Periods 5-9) shows an average demand of 340 units, compared to the early surge in Period 2 (548) and Period 3 (399). Given we are in mid-April (2019/4/15), I anticipate demand to remain steady or slightly increase rather than decline to historical winter levels (~266). Lead times have been consistently 4 periods, matching the promise. I have 645 units on-hand and 1108 in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). With a lead time of 4, the order cycle covers 5 periods (L+1). I will use the recent 5-period demand average (~340) for mu_hat Calculation. The 1108 units in transit correspond to the totals ordered in P6 (63), P7 (248), P8 (431), and P9 (366), which sums to 1108, confirming no shipments are lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at an average of ~340 units between Period 5 and Period 9, down from the February/March early-spring spike (~428 average) but still significantly higher than the initial historical baseline of ~266.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the product 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is in its peak spring season. Historical lead times for the SKU 372860001 have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10), matching the promised lead time. Demand has shifted through several regimes: from an initial baseline (~266) to an early spring spike (~428 in Feb/Mar), and has now stabilized in a more moderate but sustained range. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is 331.2 units (329, 415, 382, 322, 308), showing a plateau. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current stable spring regime. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 total periods) based on the most relevant recent consumption pattern.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand plateau observed (P6-P10): Avg demand ~331 units, reflecting settled mid-spring demand for trainer socks, lower than the early-season spike but significantly above the Feb baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a mid-spring demand phase. Historical demand spiked in Feb/March (early spring) but has since settled. Over the last 6 periods (P6-P11), the average demand is approximately 347.1 units, with the most recent observation (P11) showing a slight uptick to 427, possibly due to late April warm weather or Easter-related shopping. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in all arrival logs (P5 through P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 221 units and in-transit is 1194 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Our pipeline (1415 units) covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the recent average. To maintain service levels against the recent volatility (range 308-427), I will use the last 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable mid-season regime while accounting for the recent variance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', which is highly seasonal towards late spring and summer (May/June). Current date is May 6th. Looking at the last 7 periods (since P6), demand has averaged approximately 375 units (329, 415, 382, 322, 308, 427, 438). More importantly, the last two periods (P11, P12) show a significant increase to an average of 432.5 units, suggesting the start of the pre-summer peak. In-transit inventory is high (1211 units), covering roughly 3 periods of demand at the new higher rate. Promised and actual lead times are consistently 4 periods. To prevent an stockout during the upcoming May/June peak while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the shift from mid-spring stability to the late-spring rise). This balances the older 300-level demand with the recent 430-level demand to avoid over-reacting to a single spike while acknowledging the upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Late-spring demand acceleration observed: Average demand increased from ~330 (P6-P10) to ~433 (P11-P12), a 31% increase likely reflecting seasonal trainer sock demand peaking in May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13, 2019), we are in a peak seasonal window for trainer socks. Previous carry-over insights noted a demand acceleration in late April/early May (Periods 11-12 avg ~433). However, Period 13 demand dipped to 267. Looking at the last 8 periods (P6-P13), demand has fluctuated between ~267 and ~438 with a recent average (P11-P13) of 377. The 'In-transit' quantity (1309) matches the sum of orders from P10-P13 (65+332+448+464), confirming a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods with no lost shipments. Given the seasonality (May peak) and recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the slight P13 dip and the preceding peak, while using a wider window (N=8) for sigma_hat to account for the increased variability seen over the mid-to-late spring window. L remains at the promised default of 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/20. The SKU is 'fine-knit trainer socks', which are highly seasonal and peak during late spring and summer. Historical demand analysis shows a recent shift: while Periods 11-12 averaged ~433, the most recent two periods (P13-P14) saw a drop to an average of 271. This likely represents short-term volatility rather than a permanent downward regime shift, given the seasonal context. However, to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent_N window (N=4) for demand (P11-P14), which averages approximately 352 units/period. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (arriving on schedule). I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see high demand throughout late spring and summer. Reviewing the demand history: after a peak in late April (P11-P12 avg ~433), demand softened in the first two weeks of May (P13-P14 avg ~271), but rebounded in the most recent period (P15) to 348. This volatility is characteristic of seasonal products subject to weather changes. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods. Since P11, demand has averaged ~331 units. Given the transition into late May/June, I expect demand to remain at or above this level. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while maintaining a robust safety stock. The pipeline is full (1500 units in-transit), and on-hand inventory is low (87), but a large delivery (448 units ordered P12) is expected to arrive during this period (P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1315.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during late spring and early summer (June/July). Current date is June 3rd. Recent demand (P11-P16) has averaged 354 units, but the last several weeks show a rising trend as we enter peak summer months. Specifically, demand in the last two periods (P15-P16) averaged 359 units, and P13-P16 averaged 340. However, looking at the lead-time window (L=4), we must forecast for Period 17 through Period 21. Given the seasonality of trainer socks, demand is expected to remain high or increase further as temperatures rise in June. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat (N=6 covers P11-P16, avg ~354) to capture the higher late-spring plateau while preparing for the summer peak. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (1+L) of demand (~1770 total). PIPELINE (In-transit) is 1373 and On-hand is 165, totaling 1538, which is slightly below the required inventory level, justifying the current parameters.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P11-P16): average demand has sustained at ~354 units, representing the high-season plateau for trainer socks through June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 372860001 (trainer socks) is in its summer high-season (June). Current data shows a stable demand regime starting around Period 11. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand is 346.4 units, consistent with the 'summer plateau' described in the carry-over insights. Recent performance (Period 17) saw demand at 297 units, slightly below the average but within normal variance. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods since first observation. I am setting L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=7 to capture the demand behavior since the late-spring acceleration (P11 onwards), which accurately reflects the current summer regime. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 5 periods of demand) is responsive to current seasonal levels while filtering out earlier spring spikes.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a technical trainer sock, highly seasonal for spring and summer. Current date is June 17th. Historical analysis shows three regimes: the early spring spike (P2-P4), a mid-spring stabilization (~330 units), and the current summer plateau (P11-P18). Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), the average demand is 343 units (sum: 2746). The most recent two periods (P17-P18) show a slight cooling to ~295, but we must maintain coverage for the summer plateau as June/July are peak months for 'shaftless trainer socks'. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. On-hand is 422 with a healthy pipeline (1146). I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the summer regime average (343 units), covering the (L+1) window effectively while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering during this stable phase.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 24th, 2019 (Period 20). The SKU '372860001' is a 7-pack of basic shaftless trainer socks, which are highly seasonal for the spring and summer months. Analyzing the recent demand history (P15-P19), demand has remained stable at a summer plateau with an average of approximately 309 units ([348, 370, 297, 294, 334] / 5 = 308.6). This follows the previous summer regime identified in Period 17 (~354 units), showing a slight cooling as we move further into late June, but still significantly above the February baseline. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). For the OR backend, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent summer demand levels (~309 units/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current moderate volatility. L will be set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand (292) plus pipeline (1199) is healthy, but we must maintain ordering to cover the (L+1) window as we approach the peak of summer.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P15-P19) confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~309 units, showing a slight decrease from the early June peak but maintaining a strong seasonal plateau.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are in the mid-summer period for trainer socks. Looking at the demand history from Period 15 to Period 20, the average demand is 307 units (348, 370, 297, 294, 334, 289). This confirms the 'Mid-summer demand regime' noted in the Carry-over insights, showing a slight cooling from the late-spring peak but remaining stable. All orders from Period 1 to Period 16 have arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods, indicating a highly stable supply chain. The current inventory position is healthy with 324 units on hand and 1092 units in transit (orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this stable summer demand plateau (approx 307 * 5 = 1535) and set L to default as there is no deviation from the promised lead time of 4.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable mid-summer demand regime. For the period P15-P21, the average demand has been approximately 308.4 units per period (348, 370, 297, 294, 334, 289, 317). This represents a slight decline from the late-spring peak but creates a consistent summer plateau. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods throughout the entire game history. On-hand inventory is healthy at 377 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 980 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this specific summer demand level (P15-P21). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect current volatility and 'default' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods precisely.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (July 15, 2019) finds the SKU '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' in a stable mid-summer demand phase. Demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has been [294, 334, 289, 317, 313], averaging 309.4 units with very low volatility. This confirms the mid-summer demand regime identified in Carry-Over Insights. Lead times have remained consistently at the promised 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (P22) confirming the P18 order arrived exactly on time. On-hand inventory is healthy at 315 units, and the pipeline (1037 units) is well-populated with orders from P19-P22. Given the high service level requirements (Profit/Holding cost ratio of 4:1) and the stable seasonal plateau, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific summer demand frequency while ignoring earlier spring spikes. Lead time parameter L remains at default.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is trainer socks, which are highly seasonal. We are currently in late July (Mid-Summer). Observation of the last five periods (P19-P23) shows demands of [334, 289, 317, 313, 352], with an average of 321 units. This confirms the mid-summer demand plateau identified in the carry-over insights. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (220) plus in-transit (1010) is 1230 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At an average of ~325 units per period, 5 periods of demand equals ~1625 units. The OR backend's base-stock calculation (with profit $4 and holding $1, yielding an 80% service level) will likely result in a base stock around this level. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable summer regime while allowing the engine to react to the slight upward variance seen in P23. I will keep L at default since the lead time is consistently 4.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in the mid-to-late summer regime for '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has been [289, 317, 313, 352, 277], with an average of 309.6 units. This confirms a very stable summer plateau. Lead times have remained perfectly consistent at 4 periods. As we approach August, demand for trainer socks typically remains steady before the transition to back-to-school or autumnal styles later in the quarter. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable summer demand regime (approx 310 units/period) while ensuring the OR backend targets a safety stock reflecting recent volatility. Promised lead time is 4, which aligns with observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $865.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Historical demand for these trainer socks shows a stabilization phase since Period 20, with the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) averaging ~303 units. Specifically, the last two periods have seen a slight softening (277, 256), suggesting the peak summer demand might be transitioning into a late-summer/pre-autumn phase. Actual lead time has remained consistently at the promised 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25, lead_time 4). On-hand inventory is 159, with 1188 units in transit (orders from P22-P25 totaling 1188). To prevent excess holding costs as the high season potentially winds down, I am narrowing the analysis window to the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~300 units per period. This sets mu_hat at (1+4)*303 \u2248 1515, which, given the pipeline of 159 + 1188 = 1347, will trigger a moderate replenishment order to maintain the target base stock without overshooting if demand continues to soften slightly.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand transition observed (P21-P25): Average demand has softened to ~303 units, down from the June/July plateau of ~330, indicating a seasonal taper for trainer socks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are managing fine-knit trainer socks, which typically see high demand in spring and summer. Historical data shows demand peaked in April/May (~430) and has been gradually tapering through July and August. In the most recent 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 291 units, down from the June/July average of ~330 units. This aligns with a late-summer seasonal taper. On-hand inventory is 209 units, and 1,119 units are in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed arrivals. To account for the continuing seasonal decline into late August, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime of ~291 units per period. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized, lower-volatility late-summer demand level, ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock downward to prevent excess holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P22-P26) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~291 units, representing a clear seasonal taper from the early-summer peak (~354).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a late-summer seasonal taper as we head into late August (P28, Aug 19). Demand has transitioned from a mid-summer high-season plateau (~330-350 units) to a stabilized late-summer regime. Over the most recent five periods (P23-P27), average demand is 288.8 units, confirming the 'Period 27' carry-over insight of ~291 units. Lead times have remained consistently at the promised 4 periods. Given this stabilization and the seasonal nature of trainer socks (which typically see further decreases as autumn approaches), I will use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand regime specifically. Setting L to 'default' because actual lead times have matched promised lead times perfectly throughout the history. The in-transit inventory is high (1095 units), which reflects the pipeline filling for the (L+1) period window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019, transitioning into late summer/early autumn. Demand for the 'Fine-knit trainer socks' SKU 372860001 has settled into a late-summer taper. Since Period 22 (July 8), demand has averaged 290 units per period, consistently lower than the early summer peak (~354 units). The most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) average 280 units. As summer ends, further softening is possible, but currently, 280-290 represents the stable regime. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 204 units and a large pipeline of 1021 units (covering approximately 3.6 periods of demand at the current rate), I will maintain the 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture the demand stabilization since early July, while allowing the OR engine to optimize base stock against the observed variance. This balances the risk of overstocking during a seasonal decline against maintaining a high service level for a high-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering September (Period 30), moving from late summer into autumn. Historically, trainer socks (low-cut) are a seasonal product that peaks in late spring and summer. The carry-over insights and recent data confirm a gradual seasonal taper: June/July (P17-P23) demand averaged ~321, while the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) averaged ~268. Specifically, the last sample (P29) was 229, suggesting the taper is accelerating as the weather cools. Lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 265 and a massive in-transit pipeline of 1035 units (largely from orders placed during the slightly higher demand periods in August), we are well-covered. To avoid overstocking during the autumn decline, I will use a recent_N window for demand that captures this tapering regime (N=5 for mu_hat) and maintain the default lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal taper confirmed (P25-P29): Demand decreased to ~268 units, down from the mid-summer average of ~309, as seasonal relevance for trainer socks declines in September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which exhibit strong seasonality, tapering off as we move from summer into autumn. Demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has averaged 271 units, confirming the autumn taper noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand samples are: 258, 301, 294, 229, 274. Lead time remains stable and reliable at 4 periods (as evidenced by P26 order arriving exactly in P30). The on-hand inventory is 230 and in-transit is 890. Given the consistent seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the stabilized lower demand level (~271) across the (L+1=5) period horizon. This avoids over-ordering during the seasonal transition while maintaining a safe service level for the current regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a seasonal taper period as it transitions from late summer into autumn (September). The historical lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 25, demand has stabilized into a lower regime, with an average of approximately 262 units over the last 7 periods (P25-P31). Specifically, recent demands are: 256, 258, 301, 294, 229, 274, 254. Given the seasonal nature of trainer socks, I expect demand to continue softening or remain at this lower plateau as colder weather approaches. I will use a window of N=7 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Looking at the pipeline, we have 182 units on hand and 975 units in-transit. Arrivals scheduled for next periods are expected from orders placed in P28 (286 units), P29 (304 units), P30 (94 units), and P31 (291 units). The parameters L=4 and N=7 for demand will help the OR backend maintain a stock level that reflects the current ~262 unit demand pace while accounting for standard lead time volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which has seen a steady seasonal decline as we move into late September (Autumn). The 'Autumn seasonal taper' was previously confirmed around Period 30. Recent demand from Period 27 to 32 is [301, 294, 229, 274, 254, 248], showing a clear downward trend towards a lower baseline. The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 251. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this most recent stabilization at the lower autumn level. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as observed in all recent conclusion messages. Pipeline inventory (912) and on-hand (220) are currently high relative to the tapering demand, so the OR backend will naturally reduce order sizes to avoid excess holding costs. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historically, demand for trainer socks peaks in spring/summer and tapers in autumn. Period 33 observed a sudden spike (demand=405), which is counter-seasonal compared to the recent autumn average of ~268 (P25-P29). However, Period 33's spike might be a pre-winter clearance effect or a late-season promotional event. I will treat Period 33 as a significant outlier but remain cautious of a sustained upward shift. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 119 and in-transit at 768 (totaling 887), and an expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5) based on a blended estimate between the recent average (~270) and the recent spike, I will set mu_hat using a recent window that captures the late summer/autumn transition while giving weight to the latest volatility. N=5 (P29-P33) yields an average of ~282 units/period, which balances the seasonal taper against the P33 surge.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 35 (early October). The product is trainer socks, which are entering a secondary seasonal transition as the weather cools. Recent demand has fluctuated, showing a surprising spike in Period 33 (405) followed by 312 in Period 34. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 298.6 units. Critically, we stocked out in Period 34 (on-hand dropped to 0, sold only 213 vs demand of 312). Although in-transit inventory is high (1073 units), the immediate on-hand position is critical. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Given the stockout and the proximity to the colder months where trainer sock demand typically tapers further, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the moderate volume remains higher than the initial February baseline. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the recent variance in demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a transition phase. While the previous carry-over insight from Period 30 suggested an autumn taper (~268 units), the last 5 periods (P31-P35) have shown an average demand of 299 units, including a significant spike to 405 in P33 and 312 in P34. This suggests demand is not tapering as fast as previously expected, or perhaps stabilized higher than the initial autumn forecast. In-transit inventory is high (1187), but on-hand is low (25) due to the stockout in P34 and a tight margin in P35. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all 'conclude' messages. I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture this slightly higher-than-tapered average (approx 302/period), ensuring the OR engine maintains enough safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the recent volatility observed in late September/early October (P33: 405).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized higher than the initial autumn taper forecast: P31-P35 average is ~299 units, compared to the previously expected ~268.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which have passed their seasonal peak (spring/summer) but are maintaining a higher-than-expected autumn demand baseline (~299 units avg over P31-P35). Period 34 saw a stockout due to a previous low order (P30: 94 units), but sufficient replenishment is now in the pipeline. All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since P31, demand has been [254, 248, 405, 312, 266, 240]. The average of the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 292. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture this stabilized autumn demand regime while accounting for the recent P33 spike. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility. L is kept at 'default' (4) as lead times are stable.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an autumn demand phase. Recent demand (P33-P37) has averaged approximately 306 units, which is higher than the initial autumn taper forecast of 268 but consistent with the update in Period 36. We are currently facing a stockout situation (on-hand is 0) because recent arrivals (160 units in P37, 94 units in P34) were insufficient to cover the demand spikes. However, we have a significant pipeline of 1388 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend aims for an 80% service level. I will use a window of the last 5 periods (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (~306 units) while accounting for recent variability (ranging from 240 to 405). Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the observed lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Sock', which usually sees its peak in spring/summer and a decline as winter approaches. Current date is November 4. Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) averages 280 units, slightly lower than the P31-P35 average of 299 units noted in previous carry-over insights. This confirms a gradual seasonal taper as the weather cools. Inventory levels are healthy with 123 on hand and 1249 in-transit, but since the lead time is 4 periods, we must maintain a base stock that covers demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current late-autumn demand regime (approx 280/period). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P34-P38) confirmed: average demand has stabilized at ~280 units, showing a continued but slow seasonal taper from the early-autumn plateau (~299).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, entering the late-autumn/early-winter period for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historical demand shows a confirmed seasonal taper (Carry-over Insight Period 39) with the most recent 5-period average (P35-P39) at approximately 266 units, down from the earlier autumn plateau of ~299. Lead times remain stable at precisely 4 periods. The inventory position is currently 287 on-hand plus 928 in-transit (Total pipeline: 1215). Given the target base stock logic (L+1 periods of demand), we need to cover demand for Period 40 plus the 4-period lead time. Using a recent window of N=5 for both mean and volatility allows the OR backend to prioritize the most recent seasonal trend (the late-autumn taper) while ensuring sufficient stock levels to avoid stockouts seen in P34 and P37. The 'recent_N' method for sigma_hat will capture the slightly higher volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand taper (P35-P39) confirmed: average demand decreased to ~266 units, representing a 5% drop from the previous period's plateau (~280), as trainer sock seasonal relevance nears its annual low.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is deep into the late-autumn/early-winter season where demand for 'trainer socks' (designed for sneakers and warm weather) is seasonally low. Analysis of recent demand (P36-P40) confirms a stabilization/slight decline stage with demands of [240, 306, 276, 241, 252]. The average of these last 5 periods is 263 units, which aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 40 noting a taper to ~266 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P36-P40) to capture this current late-autumn baseline (~1315 for 5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current localized volatility (std ~26.6, resulting in a sigma_hat of ~59.6). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrivals (P37-P40 conclude messages). This conservative approach ensures we don't overstock trainer socks as we enter the coldest months while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the steady, low-season customer base.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in a late-autumn seasonal taper. Historical data shows demand has consistently softened from the mid-summer plateau (~310) to the late-autumn average (~266 in the P35-P39 block). The most recent observed demand (P41) was 210, continuing this downward trend. We are currently in late November, approaching the annual low for this product category. Consequently, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this lower demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability in the taper (approx. 248 average over P37-P41). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals from P37 to P41.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/Early-winter demand regime (P37-P41) confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~248 units, a further reduction from the late-autumn plateau (~266), reflecting the expected seasonal low for trainer socks in November/December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1101.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Historical demand for trainer socks typically hits an annual low in November and December. While Period 42 showed a demand spike to 354, the overall trend since Period 37 has averaged approximately 248 units. The Carry-over insight for Period 42 confirms this late-autumn/early-winter regime. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this seasonal low while accounting for the recent variability. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by Period 42's arrival (ordered P38). On-hand inventory is 315 and Pipeline is 685 (Orders from P39, P40, P41, P42), totaling 1000 units, which is approximately 4 periods of coverage at the 248 average. The OR parameters will be set to maintain this defensive service level during the seasonal trough to minimize holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand for trainer socks is in its seasonal low (November/December). The carry-over insights confirm a demand stabilization around ~248 units (P37-P41), but the recent demand in P43 was notably lower (143), which could be a temporary fluctuation or the start of a deeper mid-winter dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Given the low seasonal relevance of trainer socks in December, I will prioritize avoiding excess ending inventory as we approach the end of the simulation (only 4 periods remain). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-autumn/early-winter demand levels (approx 231 avg), while keeping Lead Time at default (4). Pipeline inventory (959) + On-hand (256) is quite high (1215 total), which likely covers the remaining simulation periods anyway, but the OR backend will calculate the necessary order adjustment based on these parameters.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand for trainer socks is in its seasonal trough, as indicated by the 'Socks & Tights' category entering winter. Over the last 5 periods (P40-P44), demand has averaged 231.6 units ([252, 210, 354, 143, 209]), which is consistent with the late-autumn/early-winter low identified in Carry-over Insights (approx. 248 units). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals in P43 and P44). With 213 units on-hand and 923 units in-transit (covering orders from P41 to P44), we are well-stocked for the end of the year. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sigma_hat on the same window to account for the volatility seen in Period 42. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the seasonal minimum.

Carry-over insight: Early-winter demand regime (P40-P44) confirmed: average demand is ~232 units, marking the seasonal low for trainer socks during November and December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in its seasonal low (December) with a confirmed demand regime around 232 units (P40-P44). Period 45 demand (231) reinforces this plateau. On-hand inventory is 221, and there are 863 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the following arrivals: 196 (P46), 358 (P47), 130 (P48), and 179 (P49). The current pipeline is heavy (863 units) relative to the expected demand of ~232 units per period over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will set \u03bc\u0302 using recent_N=5 (P41-P45) to capture the current early-winter baseline of ~233 units, ensuring the system doesn't over-order during this seasonal trough. Lead time L is consistent at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the heart of the winter season and the final period. As identified in previous carry-over insights, 'Fine-knit trainer socks' are in their seasonal low. The demand for the most recent period (P46) was 224, aligning with the P40-P44 average of approximately 232. I am setting L to the promised lead time of 4, which has been consistent throughout the history. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the stabilized early-winter demand regime (P41-P46), which covers the seasonal low-point without including the higher November peaks. This results in a forecast of approximately 1160 units for the (L+1) period horizon (5 * ~232). Using the recent_N method for sigma_hat with N=6 ensures the inventory buffer reflects the stabilized, lower volatility observed during this winter plateau, preventing overstocking as the seasonal trough concludes.
