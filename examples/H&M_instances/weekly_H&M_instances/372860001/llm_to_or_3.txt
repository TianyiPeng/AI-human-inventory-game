Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for a 'Fine-knit trainer socks' SKU. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand over the last 5 periods [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] shows a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 26.6. Since this is the first decision period and we have no reported arrivals yet, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'default' for lead time (0 periods). The backend will calculate base stock using these statistics and the high profitability ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), ensuring sufficient stock for the next cycle.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods (ordered 289, arrived 289 within the same period), which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 287, and historical demand suggests a stable range around 230-300 units. Since we only have 2 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to order to cover the upcoming demand. The base stock calculation in the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. Historical data [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287] averages ~270. With L=0, \u03bc\u0302 should represent demand for (1+0) = 1 period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the full recent history including the most recent observation. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's socks, and we are currently in late February. Period 2 saw a massive demand spike (548 units), which is more than double the initial historical average (~266). This likely indicates a stock-out event where demand exceeded visible sales (only 291 were sold). Because we are at Period 3 with only two periods of game history and a significant demand shift detected in Period 2, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=2 to capture this elevated volatility and higher mean. The promised lead time of 0 periods has held true for both P1 and P2 orders, so I will maintain the default lead time setting.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic staple. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 2 (548), while Period 1 and Period 3 were more moderate (287 and 399). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 411. Promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0 in history (P1-P3). However, given the volatility (high SD) and the risk of stockouts seen in Period 2, I will use recent history (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture the recent demand surge. On-hand is currently 174, and since L=0, the backend will calculate base_stock and order the difference immediately to cover current period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic item. Period 5 is mid-March, entering spring. Demand history shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (Past demands) and Period 1-4 observed demands: [287, 548, 399, 338]. There was a significant spike in Period 2 (548) which appears to be an outlier or a specific promotion, as demand has since stabilized downward (399, then 338). Excluding the spike, the recent average demand is approximately 320-340 units. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stabilization after the Period 2 spike while remaining responsive to the current level. I will use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility, excluding the extreme variance of the spike period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic staple. Historical demand across the first 5 periods is [287, 548, 399, 338, 252]. Note that in Period 2, we actually stocked out (ending inventory 0), so the 'true' demand might have been higher than the recorded demand (or the recorded demand already reflects the total lost sales). However, looking at the trend from Period 2 onwards, demand has been steadily declining as we move away from late winter into mid-March. The mean demand of the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is approximately 330 units. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the broader average including the spike, while using recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect the more recent volatility levels. L remains at the promised 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic staple item. Current date is late March. Historical demand for the last 5 segments (including pre-game and the first 6 periods) shows: [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (pre-game) and [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329] (game periods). This suggests a mean demand around 317 units with significant volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period for all 6 active game periods. There are no overdue shipments. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent performance while smoothing out the outlier demand of 548 in Period 2. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers immediate demand, using the profit/holding cost ratio to set the service level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown a significant demand spike in Period 7 (415 units), coincident with late March/early April, which often correlates with seasonal shifts toward spring apparel. Over the last three periods (P5, P6, P7), demand has trended upward: 252 -> 329 -> 415. The average demand across these 3 periods is 332. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To handle the increasing trend and recent volatility, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot toward the higher demand regime while maintaining a responsive base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: Demand increased from an average of ~260 (P4-P5) to an average of 372 (P6-P7), indicating a spring seasonal upturn for trainer socks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is experiencing a sustained demand increase as we move into April, likely due to spring seasonality. Demand over the last three periods (P6-P8) has averaged 375 units (329, 415, 382) compared to the pre-regime shift average of ~260. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders arriving within the same period they were placed. I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current demand regime and its volatility effectively, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for this higher demand level while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and stable: Periods 6-8 average demand is 375, representing a 45% increase from the initial baseline, aligning with spring seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in a confirmed higher demand regime due to spring seasonality (commencing around Period 6). Demand for the last 4 periods (P6-P9) has been [329, 415, 382, 322], giving a mean of 362. This is significantly higher than the early-period baseline. Historical L=0 has been consistently observed across all 9 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained spring demand regime, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects current velocity rather than the lower long-term average. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to capture recent volatility. L=0 remains the reliable lead time estimate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in its spring seasonal peak. Reviewing recent demand from Period 6 through Period 10 (329, 415, 382, 322, 308), the average demand is 351.2 units per period. The demand in the last two periods (322, 308) has softened slightly compared to the peak (415), but remains significantly higher than the initial baseline (~260-280). Given the promised lead time of 0 (L=0) and the consistent historical arrival of orders within the same period (actual L=0), I am setting parameters based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current seasonal regime while respecting the slight recent deceleration. The base stock calculation by the OR engine will target a service level of 80% (4/(4+1)), which is appropriate for a high-turnover item with a relatively low holding cost.

In Period 11, we experienced a stockout (demand 427, only 390 units available), indicating that recent demand is consistently exceeding the earlier baseline. Specifically, the demand for Periods 7-11 has averaged 370.8 units, while Period 11 itself saw a spike to 427. Lead time has reliably remained at 0 periods throughout history, permitting same-period fulfillment. Given the stockout and the high demand in P11, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture this elevated demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher mean (approx 371) and recent volatility, reducing the risk of further lost sales during this peak period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks' (372860001), currently experiencing a spring seasonal demand surge as expected. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift starting Around Period 6/7. Recent demands (P11: 427, P12: 438) indicate the seasonal peak is intensifying compared to the P6-P10 average of ~351. Demand has exceeded stock for two consecutive periods, leading to lost sales and zero ending inventory. I will focus on the most recent 7 periods (P6-P12) to capture this higher seasonal plateau. The average demand for this period is approximately 376 units, with P11 and P12 significantly exceeding that. To prevent stockouts during this peak, I'll set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P8-P12) which average 379 units, and sigma_hat based on the same window to capture the increased volatility (standard deviation of ~60). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods (same-period arrival).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak intensification: Periods 11-12 demand averaged 432 units (+23% vs P6-10 average), resulting in stockouts. Adjusted forecast window to prioritize recent high-demand periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Trainer Socks) is currently in a high-demand spring season. While Periods 11 and 12 saw a significant peak (demand > 425), Period 13 dropped to 267. This looks like a combination of post-holiday (Easter/April peak) cooling and stabilization. However, demand remains higher than the early baseline (P1-P5). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging 427, 438, 267 = 377) to smooth the recent volatility while capturing the current seasonal baseline. Lead time is consistently 0, so I'll stick with the default. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the high variance observed in these recent cycles, ensuring the OR engine maintains an appropriate buffer for this seasonal product (7p Basic Shaftless socks).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Shaftless Trainer Socks) is currently in a spring/early summer season. Demand analysis shows a significant shift in May: Period 13 and 14 demand dropped to an average of 271, compared to the peak average of 432 observed in Periods 11-12. This suggests that the early May peak has subsided, or the initial stockout-driven demand surge has stabilized. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on this, I am shifting the forecasting window to recent_N=4 (covering Periods 11-14) to capture the cooling demand (Avg ~351) while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent a repeat of the Period 11-12 stockouts. Holding inventory is currently at 183 units, so a slightly more conservative mu_hat is appropriate to avoid overstocking as we move further into May.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following the late-April peak (Avg 432), demand in early May (P13-P14) has stabilized lower (Avg 271), suggesting the seasonal peak has passed its maximum intensity.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is trainer socks, which show spring/summer seasonality. Demand context: After a peak in late April (P12 demand: 438), demand has moderated but remains significant in late May (P15 demand: 348). The average demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) is 296.6 units, compared to the peak average of 432 units. We are currently in late May (P16). Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which provides high responsiveness. Lead time (L) remains 0. For \u03bc\u0302, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the post-peak demand level (Avg ~297), which is lower than the peak but higher than the P13-P14 average. Using N=3 for \u03c3\u0302 will account for the recent variability as demand stabilizes into a summer pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (late May) has stabilized at a moderate level: P13-P15 average demand is 297, down from the 432 peak in P11-P12.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3 (Period 17). The product 'fine-knit trainer socks' has completed its spring peak (April) and is now in its early summer demand phase. Demand in Period 16 was 370, which resulted in a stockout. Over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has averaged 315 units (267, 275, 348, 370), indicating that while the peak of 430+ is over, demand remains significantly higher than the initial baseline (~260) and is showing a slight upward trend as summer begins. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Using a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat will capture the current post-peak stabilization level (mean ~315) while being responsive to the slight increase observed in P15 and P16. Sigma_hat using N=4 will account for the recent volatility (std dev ~52) to ensure a safety buffer against continued stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Following the early May dip, late-May/early-June demand (P15-P16) has averaged 359 units, suggesting a higher summer floor compared to the spring baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its summer demand phase. Reviewing recent history: Period 17 demand was 297, following 370 in P16 and 348 in P15. The average demand over the last three periods (P15-P17) is 338.3 units. This supports the observation in Carry-over Insights that the demand has stabilized at a higher 'summer floor' (around 330-360) compared to the initial spring baseline (~260-270), even if it remains below the peak April spikes (>400). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized summer demand while remaining responsive to potential minor fluctuations, I will use a 5-period window (P13-P17) which covers the post-peak stabilization period, resulting in a mean demand of approximately 311.4 per period. This balances the lower early-May dip with the recent higher late-May/early-June demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 17, demand for trainer socks (372860001) has settled after the late-April/early-May peak. The last four periods (P15-P18) show demand of 348, 370, 297, and 294, respectively. This gives an average of 327.25 units. This represents a stabilized 'summer floor' which is lower than the peak (432) but higher than the initial February baseline (~260-280). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining responsiveness to the moderate variance observed in this regime. On-hand inventory is currently low (56), so the base stock policy will naturally trigger a restock to meet this stabilized demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a 'summer floor' following the spring peak. Averaged 327 units over P15-P18, transitioning from the higher volatility seen in April.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable summer demand regime (Date: 2019/6/24). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has averaged 328.6 units, showing consistent performance after the late-April/early-May peak and dip. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring immediate replenishment. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized summer average and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current moderate volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected 329 units of demand while maintaining a buffer for seasonal variance, minimizing stockout risk observed in previous high-demand weeks.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is in its summer season (July 1st). Demand has entered a stable 'summer floor' regime following the spring peak. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 316.8 units (370, 297, 294, 334, 289), with a slight downward trend in the most recent observation but generally staying above the 300 mark. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 20 historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current summer stabilization while filtering out the volatile spring peaks (P11-P12). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current moderate volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the current 'summer floor' demand without over-reacting to past seasonal extremes.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, which is squarely in the summer season for trainer socks. Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has been relatively stable, with an average of 306 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21. This reflects the 'summer floor' identified in previous carry-over insights. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, ensuring same-period arrivals. To optimize for the current regime, I am choosing a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable summer demand level while protecting against slight fluctuations. The profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) implies a target service level of 80%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and summer. Following the late-April peak, demand has stabilized into a consistent 'summer floor'. Over the last five periods (P18-P22), demand has been very stable, averaging approximately 309 units (294, 334, 289, 317, 313) with low volatility. No major mid-July calendar spikes are anticipated for this utility product category. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stable summer demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding in the same period it was placed.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical data confirms that lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Demand for trainer socks has reached a stable 'summer floor' following the spring peak. Recent demand history shows Period 20: 289, Period 21: 317, Period 22: 313, and Period 23: 352. The average demand over the last four periods is 317.75. Period 23 resulted in a stockout (demand 352 vs on-hand 325), indicating that demand remains robust. To respond to this slight upward trend and prevent further stockouts while maintaining the summer baseline, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent demand behavior (approx. 318 units per period) while ignoring the higher volatility of the earlier spring peak and the lower dips in May.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and steady demand through summer. Reviewing the recent demand history (Period 19-24), the values are [334, 289, 317, 313, 352, 277]. The mean over these last 6 periods is approximately 313.7. The demand has remained relatively stable around the 'summer floor' identified in previous carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is 63. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual L=0), I will maintain L=default. To capture the current stable summer demand while filtering out minor weekly fluctuations, I will use a recent_N window of 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the stable period post-June 17th.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and summer. Historical data shows demand peaked in April (P11-P12 avg: 432) and has since stabilized at a lower summer level. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), demand has averaged 319.9 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P22-P25) have seen a slight downward trend (313, 352, 277, 256; avg: 299.5), likely signaling the beginning of the late-summer/autumn decline as the peak trainer sock season ends. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for the remainder of the warm season, I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable summer baseline, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-summer peak (August): Demand shows a slight downward trend in the last 4 periods (avg 299.5 vs summer floor avg 327), likely indicating the end of the high-season for trainer socks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown a sustained decrease as the summer season concludes. In the last 4 periods (P23-P26), demand has averaged 285.75 units, significantly down from the earlier summer baseline of ~330 units. The most recent two weeks (P25-P26) have been even lower, averaging 257 units. Given this cooling trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this downward shift while maintaining enough safety stock to avoid stockouts if volatility persists. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders successfully concluding in the same period they were placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for August: P23-P26 average demand is 285.75, representing a ~13% decrease from the summer peak floor of 327, marking the transition out of peak seasonal demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19, which is late August. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item typically peaking in spring and summer. Historical demand analysis shows a cooling trend as we exit the peak summer season. The carry-over insights indicate a demand shift starting around Period 23, with the average demand for the last four periods (P24-P27) being 273 units, compared to the summer floor average of 327. Last period's demand (P27) was 301, suggesting some volatility, but the overall trend is downward. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this cooling trend (average of P23-P27 is 288.8 units). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period), so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend sustained: Average demand for P24-P27 is 273 units, a significant drop from the summer floor of 327, confirming the seasonal transition out of peak summer demand for trainer socks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is continuing its transition from the peak summer floor (avg ~327) to a cooler late-August/early-September regime. Observations from P24-P28 show demands of 277, 256, 258, 301, and 294. The last five periods (P24-P28) average 277.2 units, confirming the cooling trend noted in carry-over insights. Total lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this stabilized lower demand while maintaining a buffer for late-summer variability, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5. This aligns the base stock calculation with the current seasonal floor. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the current localized volatility without being skewed by the higher volatility seen during the April/May peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks continues to decline as we enter September (P30, 2019/9/2), following the end of the peak summer season. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 270.5 units, which is significantly lower than the summer average of approximately 327. The most recent demand (P29) was 229 units, the lowest since early March. This confirms a seasonal shift towards lower autumn volumes. I am using a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this cooling trend and avoid overstocking while holding costs are relatively high ($1) compared to the profit ($4). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend finalized for September: P26-P29 average demand is 270.5 units (vs summer floor of 327), reflecting the seasonal transition into autumn for trainer socks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks (SKU 372860001) is currently in a seasonal cooling phase as we move into September. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 271.2 units, significantly lower than the summer average of approximately 327. The most recent demand (P30) was 274, confirming this stabilization at a lower autumn baseline. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established cooling trend while ignoring the higher volatility of the mid-summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. This setup allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8) based on current autumn demand profiles.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that typically peaks in spring/summer and declines in autumn. Current date is mid-September (2019/09/16). Demand history shows a clear downward trend from the 'summer floor' of ~327 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is 268.3 units, significantly lower than the July average. The most recent 4 periods (P28-P31) average 262.75 units. This confirms the transition into the autumn low-demand regime, as noted in the carry-over insights for Period 30. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture this established cooling trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to further declines as autumn progresses. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is consistently cooling as we move further into September (Period 33, 2019/09/23). The previous 'summer floor' of ~327 units has clearly shifted. For the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged 265.4 units, with the most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) averaging 258.7 units. This indicates a stable 'autumn baseline' that is significantly lower and less volatile than the summer peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established cooling trend while maintaining enough data to account for the current demand variance. This setting prevents overstocking as seasonal demand for trainer socks typically continues to decline or stay flat during the autumn months.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend stabilized for September/October: P26-P32 average demand is 265 units, down 19% from the summer floor of 327.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is entering the fall season (Date: 2019/09/30). Period 33 observed a significant demand spike of 405 units, which caused a stockout. This spike contrasts with the 'cooling trend' noted since Period 26, where demand averaged ~265 units. This could be a back-to-school outlier or a temporary promotion. Given the immediate stockout and zero on-hand inventory, I need to restock quickly. However, I must avoid overreacting to a single high data point if the general trend is seasonal cooling. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat (covering Period 26 to 33) to capture the cooling trend while acknowledging the recent spike (average ~283). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to capture the increased volatility from the P33 spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Unexpected demand spike in Period 33 (405 units) disrupted the cooling trend (avg 265); monitoring if this indicates a new sustained level or an isolated event.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, there was a significant demand spike (405 units) which caused a stockout. Period 34 demand (312 units) remains elevated compared to the September average (approx. 250-260 units). This suggests that while we are in the autumn transition for trainer socks, we are seeing a secondary demand stabilization or peak, possibly due to 'back-to-school' or late-season clearance effects in early October. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility (Periods 31-34 demand: 254, 248, 405, 312) while allowing the OR backend to set a sufficient base stock that prevents further stockouts during this volatile transition period. On-hand inventory is currently very low (17 units), so a prompt order is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Post-September cooling, demand has stabilized at a higher-than-expected level in late September/early October (P33-P34 average: 358.5) compared to the previous cooling floor (P26-P32 average: 265).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in Period 36 (mid-October). After a seasonal cooling trend in late August/September (avg ~265-270), demand spiked unexpectedly in Period 33 (405 units) and has remained relatively elevated and volatile in the following weeks (P34: 312, P35: 266). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P33-P35) is 327.7 units, which is significantly higher than the previous cooling floor. This suggests either a late-season promotional bump or a new stabilized level for the autumn. Given the high volatility (sigma) seen in these recent peaks and stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this updated demand profile and provide sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late September/October: Following the autumn cooling trend, demand has shifted upwards again to an average of 327.7 units (P33-P35), showing higher volatility than the previous period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October (Period 37). The recent demand history (P33-P36: 405, 312, 266, 240) shows a declining trend after an unexpected late-September spike. The most recent two periods (avg 253) align more closely with the previous autumn cooling trend (avg 265) than the high-volatility spike observed in P33. However, considering the carry-over insight of a regime shift, I will use a window of 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current state (average 305.75) which balances the recent spike with the subsequent cooling. Lead time remains consistently 0. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to account for the high volatility introduced by the Period 33 spike, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient if demand remains erratic.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early October; however, the last two periods (P35-P36) suggest a return to the autumn cooling trend (avg 253) after the P33 spike.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is currently in a late-October period. After a temporary demand spike in late September (Period 33: 405 units), demand has returned to a more stable but slightly volatile autumn level. The last four periods (P34-P37) show demand values of 312, 266, 240, and 306, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 281 units. This aligns with the 'autumn cooling trend' previously identified, albeit with more noise than the summer phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level), I will use the recent 5 periods (P33-P37) to capture the current regime which includes the P33 spike as a buffer against volatility, while acknowledging the generally lower demand levels compared to summer.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering November. Historical patterns and recent data (P35-P38) show demand stabilizing after the early October volatility. Demand in the last four periods was [266, 240, 306, 276], averaging 272 units. This aligns with the 'autumn cooling trend' previously identified (P26-P32 average was 265). The promised and actual lead times remain consistently at 0 periods. To balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'autumn' regime while smoothing out the minor week-to-week fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current demand levels as we approach the end of the game (total 47 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully returned to the autumn cooling trend level: P35-P38 average demand is 272 units, consistent with the late-September pre-spike levels (~265).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has stabilized following the autumn cooling trend, with an average demand of approximately 266 units over the last five periods (P35-P39: 266, 240, 306, 276, 241). This period (P40, 2019/11/11) is moving deeper into November, where demand for trainer socks typically remains at a lower 'winter baseline' compared to summer months. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect this current stable demand regime and capture the slightly lower volatility compared to the earlier October fluctuations. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that aligns with the confirmed autumn/winter cooling trend.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/18. Demand for trainer socks has stabilized in an autumn cooling trend. Analyzing the most recent data (P35-P40), the average demand is 263.5 units, which is consistent with the established 'autumn cooling' floor of approximately 265-270 units. There are no missing shipments, and the lead time remains 0 periods. To capture this stabilized regime while filtering out the noise from the late-October volatility (P37 demand was 306), I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window focuses specifically on the stabilized post-spike period (Late October - mid November). Inventory is currently low (37 units), and since lead time is 0, the backend will place an order to meet the base stock requirements for the next period immediately.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in its late-autumn cooling phase. Since the confirmed regime shift reported in Period 39 (stabilization at ~272 units), recent demand has actually hovered lower: the average for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 244.75 units. This suggests a continued slow decline as we head into winter. On-hand inventory is 75 units, and actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent cooling trend, while maintaining L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand further cooled in November: P38-P41 average demand is 245 units, down from the October average of ~272 units, consistent with winter seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is entering December. Historically, demand for this item shows winter cooling (P38-P41 avg ~245), but Period 42 saw a significant spike to 354, which resulted in a stockout. This spike likely corresponds to early December shopping or promotional activity (Cyber Monday/pre-Christmas). Given the stockout and the spike, I need to raise the base stock level to prevent further lost sales during the holiday peak. I will use the last 5 periods (P38-P42) for mu_hat to capture the recent trend including the spike (avg ~267), but I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat at 310 to ensure we carry enough buffer for the December demand which clearly exceeded recent averages in P42. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Early December demand spike observed (P42: 354) despite winter cooling trend, likely seasonal holiday shopping for socks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th (Period 44). We are in the middle of the holiday shopping season. Recent history shows a significant demand spike in Period 42 (354 units) followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (143 units). This behavior is typical of holiday volatility where shopping surges and then dips before a final pre-Christmas peak. I expect demand to rebound as we get closer to the peak gifting period in mid-December. While the average over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 240, the P42 spike (354) warns that 240 is too low a baseline for the coming weeks. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the broader winter/holiday trend (average ~260) but will also apply a slightly higher mu_hat via the 'explicit' method (280) to ensure we don't stock out during the final two weeks of December. This balances the risk of a late-December surge against the high holding cost ($1.00 relative to $4.00 profit). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility confirmed: P42 spike (354) followed by P43 dip (143) indicates erratic late-December demand. Preparing for a final pre-Christmas surge.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (2019/12/16), the final full week before Christmas. This period typically sees the highest demand for 'stocking-stuffer' items like trainer socks. The 'Holiday season volatility' noted in Carry-over insights is evident: P42 saw a spike (354), P43 a sharp drop (143), and P44 moderate demand (209). History shows that in similar high-demand periods (e.g., P11-P12 peak demand reached 432-438), trainer socks can spike significantly. Given we only have 3 periods left (P45, P46, P47), we must ensure we have enough inventory to cover the final pre-Christmas rush and the immediate post-holiday period. On-hand is currently 130. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 (P42-P44) to capture the current holiday volatility average (~235), but I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (standard deviation of P42-P44 is ~107) to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P2, P11, P12, P16, P23, and P33.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), the final full week before Christmas. Since this is a trainer sock product, demand typically spikes due to holiday shopping then drops significantly immediately after Christmas as consumer focus shifts. The last four periods (P42-P45) show extreme volatility (354, 143, 209, 231) with an average of 234. However, Period 46/47 will cover the Christmas peak and the subsequent post-holiday slump. Given the current date (Dec 23), Period 46 demand is likely to be strong (last-minute gifts), but Period 47 will face a sharp decline. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking into the January lull while satisfying the remaining holiday demand, I will use an explicit mu_hat that reflects a 'one last push' average rather than the full holiday peak. I'll set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (approx 234) for the (1+L) window to ensure we don't carry too much holding cost into the new year. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the recent holiday-driven volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Holiday demand peak appears to be plateauing/ending. Observed average P43-P45 is 194 units, significantly lower than the P42 spike (354). Transitioning to post-holiday demand levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the immediate post-Christmas period. Looking at the history, the holiday volatility observed from Period 42 (P42: 354, P43: 143, P44: 209, P45: 231, P46: 224) has stabilized around a lower average compared to the early December spike. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is 201.75 units. This is consistent with a seasonal wind-down for trainer socks in winter. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given the stabilization at a lower level, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-holiday baseline while maintaining enough variance to handle the residual post-Christmas shopping or returns. The lead time L remains at the default promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Period 43-46 average demand has settled at 201.75 units, confirming the end of the December holiday surge and a return to late-winter baseline levels.
