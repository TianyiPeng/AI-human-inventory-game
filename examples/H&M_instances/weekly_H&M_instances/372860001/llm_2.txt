The target pipeline (on-hand + in-transit + current order) must cover demand for L+1 (3) periods. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a basic staple. The date is Feb 11, 2019, which is post-winter and moving towards spring/summer where trainer socks typically see stable or increasing demand. Historical samples [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] show a mean of 266.4 units. To ensure high service level and avoid stockouts during the lead time, I will aim for a pipeline stock of approximately 3 * 270 = 810 units.

Period 1 data shows a demand of 287, which is slightly higher than the historical average but within a reasonable variance. My on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order is in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 3 'conclude' message (to be read at the start of Period 4). Therefore, I expect no arrivals in Period 2 or Period 3. To maintain a pipeline that covers the next three periods (Period 2, 3, and 4), I need to account for the expected demand. Total pipeline needed = 3 periods * ~280 demand = 840 units. Current in-transit is 810. I will order 300 units to ensure I have a buffer for Period 4 and to account for the slightly higher observed demand (287 vs 266). The product (Women's trainer socks) is a basic staple, and mid-February doesn't suggest an immediate major seasonal spike, though spring transitions often increase demand for 'trainer socks' as weather warms.",

Period 1 demand was 287. Period 2 demand spiked to 548. This suggests a significant regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. c) Lead Time: Period 1's order of 810 units arrived in Period 2 (lead_time = 1 period), which is faster than the promised 2 periods. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 262. In-transit is 300 (ordered P2, expected P3 or P4). Total pipeline = 562. e) Order Logic: Given the spike to 548, I need to protect against a sustained high demand regime (~500+ units/period).

Historically, we have identified that approximately 1,950 units from earlier periods (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13) are lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The nominal 'In-transit' of 3,850 units is misleading because it includes the 1,950 lost units plus the recent block of non-arriving orders (P21-P26). Specifically, the P21 order (300 units) is now at lead time 5, P22 (250 units) at lead time 4, and P23 (300 units) at lead time 3. Given that the promised lead time is 2, these are significantly delayed or potentially lost. Demand has stabilized around ~280-320 units. To restore inventory while accounting for the high failure rate (approx. 40-50% based on history), I must continue ordering to ensure that if the 'logjam' breaks, we have stock, but primarily to account for the high probability of shipment loss.

Given the historical evidence of approximately 3,450 units lost, the current 'In-transit' figure of 4,300 is misleading. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from Periods 38-39 (150 + 250 = 400 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has remained relatively stable but slightly elevated in November, averaging ~275 units. As we approach late November and December (Black Friday/Holiday season), socks often see a seasonal demand spike. To restore a safety cushion and cover a 3-period lead-time window plus the current period (L+1=4), I need ~1,200 units (300 demand x 4). With only 400 effective units in transit, an order of 800 units is necessary to replenish stock and mitigate the high attrition rate of the supplier.",

Total In-transit is 4700, but according to historical tracking, approximately 3900 units are confirmed or highly probable losses (P4, P8, P10, P11, P13, P21, P22, P23, P24, P25, P34, P36). Subtracting these from the nominal 4700 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 800 units (the P40 order). Current On-hand is 148. Total effective inventory (On-hand 148 + Effective In-transit 800) is 948 units. At a forecast of ~300 units/period and an effective lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for periods 41, 42, and 43 (approx 900 units). While we are currently covered for the immediate lead time, given the high attrition rate (roughly 30-40% of orders never arrive) and the upcoming holiday demand spike, I will place a moderate order to maintain a safety buffer and compensate for potential future order losses.",

Calculating effective pipeline: Nominal In-transit (4,850) - Confirmed Lost (3,900) = 950 units. These 950 units include orders from P40 (800) and P41 (300) minus those already arrived. Specifically, P40 (800) and P41 (300) are the primary active shipments.
