Historical demand samples suggest an average of 266 units/period (231, 255, 302, 272, 272). Promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival). With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to order enough to satisfy the current period's demand.

{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees lower demand in deep winter (late December/January) as customers shift to heavier hosiery. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition into the New Year. History shows a winter demand regime (P43-P46) averaging ~202 units [143, 209, 231, 224], which is significantly lower than the historical baseline of 266 and the summer/spring peaks. Given that lead time is consistently 0, I only need to order enough to cover the immediate period's demand while accounting for current on-hand inventory. Period 46 demand was 224, and the 4-period winter average is ~202. I will forecast demand for Period 47 at 225 units to be safe. Starting on-hand is 76. Therefore, I need to order (225 - 76) = 149 units to satisfy expected demand for Period 47.",
