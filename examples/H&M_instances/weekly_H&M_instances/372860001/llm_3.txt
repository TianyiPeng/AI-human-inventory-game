Historical demand samples [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] suggest a mean around 266. Period 1 demand was 287, which aligns with this range. I currently have 0 on-hand inventory (due to the initial lead time delay) and 800 units in-transit from Period 1. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order (800 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. In the meantime, Period 2 and Period 3 demand will likely be lost as I have 0 on-hand. To cover demand for Period 4 and 5 (accounting for the L+1 rule where L=2), I need to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~800-900 units). Since 800 are already in-transit, I will place a smaller order of 300 units to build a safety buffer and account for the demand I am currently missing, while minimizing holding costs once the bulk arrives.",

Historical mean is ~360-380. (c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: P4 (350) and P8 (400) are confirmed lost/stalled (P8 is now 6 periods late). In-transit contains orders from P10 (350), P11 (400), P12 (400), and P13 (500). Arrival patterns are highly volatile (1-3 periods). (d) Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of P10 (350, T+4), P11 (400, T+3), P12 (400, T+2), P13 (500, T+1). Given volatility and lost orders, the pipeline is unreliable. P10 is likely lost or very late.

I expect demand to spike significantly in P45 and P46, potentially reaching 400+ units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 1182 units. Pipeline analysis: Total In-transit is 4750, but a significant portion is 'phantom' stock.

P40 and P42 arrived, but P43 (450 units) is still in the valid 1-3 period lead time window. Thus, 'real' in-transit is likely only 450 units (P43) plus 300 units (P44).
