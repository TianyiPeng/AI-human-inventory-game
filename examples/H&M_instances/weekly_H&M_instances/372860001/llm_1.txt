The current date is February 11, 2019. Being a basic trainer sock (7-pack), this is a staple item with likely stable demand, though trainer socks often see a slight increase as the weather warms up toward Spring. Since Period 1 starts with 0 inventory and 0 in-transit, and the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period immediately. The system execution order indicates the order placed now will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 1 and be available for the demand resolution phase of Period 1. I will target the historical mean plus a small buffer for variance, aiming for approximately 280 units to ensure high service level given the high profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1) ratio.",

Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I need to cover Period 3 demand. Given the stockouts in P1 and P2, the 'actual' demand in P2 (548) is the best signal.
