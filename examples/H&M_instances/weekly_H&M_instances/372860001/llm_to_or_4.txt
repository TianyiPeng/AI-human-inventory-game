Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks). Basic socks usually have stable demand, though the start of spring/warmer weather (February) might see a slight uptick for trainer socks. Past demand over the last 5 periods (231, 255, 302, 272, 272) yields a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 26.6. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, the system needs to place an initial order to cover demand for the lead time (0) plus the review period (1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 0, so I will use 'default' for L.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 289 units, which arrived immediately (lead time 0). Historical demand shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] and Period 1 demand was 287. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees standard demand in February. The actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods. Since demand appears relatively stable (mean of history is ~266, Period 1 was 287), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent trend while maintaining a stable baseline. Given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the target service level q is 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which the OR engine will use to set the safety stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a staple item. Current period is Feb 25, 2019. Observed lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. History shows a significant demand spike in Period 2 (548 units), which is more than double the prior 5-period average (approx 266). This is likely a stock-out induced demand signal or a pre-spring seasonal surge. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit at the start of Period 3, and considering the recent demand jump, I will use a recent_N (N=2) approach for mu_hat to capture the trend while being cautious, and explicit sigma to handle the increased volatility seen in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility detected; Period 2 demand (548) is 2x the historical mean (266). Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019/3/4), we evaluate the demand for women's fine-knit trainer socks. Historical demand was stable around 266, but a significant spike occurred in Period 2 (548) followed by a high demand in Period 3 (399). Given the date (early March), this likely represents a seasonal shift as consumers transition to trainer socks for spring. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods across all three historical interaction periods. Because demand has transitioned from a mean of ~260 to a higher regime (average of the last two periods is 473.5), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this recent increase while moderating the extreme spike of Period 2. Setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the backend to adapt to the higher volume and volatility observed in the most recent periods (P1: 287, P2: 548, P3: 399).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: Demand increased from ~260 to an average of 473 over the last 2 periods, likely seasonal (Spring trainer socks). Lead time consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically see a demand increase as spring approaches (current date March 11). History shows a clear demand shift starting in Period 2. Previous average demand was ~266, while the last three periods (P2-P4) have averaged 428.3 units (548, 399, 338). Although there was a peak in P2, demand remains significantly higher than the initial baseline. Lead time is confirmed consistent at 0 periods across all concluded observations. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand spring regime while acknowledging the volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the seasonality observed in the weeks leading into March.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 2: Average demand increased from ~266 to ~428 units (+60%) coincident with the start of Spring season for trainer socks. Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which is a seasonal item for Spring/Summer. We are currently in mid-March (Period 6). Historical demand before the shift (P1-P2) averaged ~266. Since Period 2, we saw a spike to 548, then stabilization at 399, 338, and 252. The 252 in Period 5 is a notable dip relative to the recent 'Spring shift' average, but still aligns with the overall increased sales volume compared to early February. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 5 completed periods. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift demand regime (Period 2 to Period 5: 548, 399, 338, 252), which averages 384 units per period. This covers the (L+1) horizon (1 period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility (std dev is ~125 for this period). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the seasonal surge while acknowledging the cooling off from the initial peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1155.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees a demand surge in spring (late February/March). Historical demands are [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (ancient) and recent game history [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329]. A clear regime shift occurred at Period 2 (late Feb), where demand jumped significantly above the initial 260-270 average. Since Period 2, the average demand is 373.2. Period 6 demand was 329, showing sustained higher volume compared to the pre-shift baseline. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand spring regime (Periods 2-6) while smoothing out the Period 2 spike. Lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 161, which is low relative to recent demand; these parameters will prompt the backend to restock to cover the (L+1) period demand (~373 units).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for trainer socks confirmed: Average demand from Period 2 to Period 6 is 373 units, compared to pre-Period 2 baseline of ~265 (+40%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a Spring seasonal demand regime. Since Period 2, demand has averaged 380 units, significantly higher than the pre-Period 2 baseline of ~266. The most recent demand (Period 7) was 415 units, indicating that the seasonal peak is likely sustained as we move further into April. History confirms lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the current regime, I am setting L to default (0) and mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the average demand during this Spring window (Periods 2-7). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to account for the increased volatility observed during this high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1445.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is in the midst of its Spring seasonal peak (confirmed since Period 2). Demand averages approximately 380 units since Period 2 (last 7 periods: 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415, 382). Current on-hand inventory is low at 83 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand plus a safety buffer. Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the higher mean and volatility of this Spring regime without being skewed by the pre-Period 2 baseline demand (~266). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current seasonal level while acknowledging the profit/holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime remains stable: last 3 periods (P6-P8) average 375 units (consistent with the P2-P8 average of 382). Lead time is reliably 0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in its Spring demand regime (Period 2 to Period 9), with demand averaging 373 units. The most recent demand (P9: 322) is slightly below the regime average but remains consistent with the established higher baseline compared to the pre-Spring data. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), making the inventory management highly responsive. For Period 10 (April 15), we continue utilizing the recent_N method to capture the Spring regime (N=8, covering P2-P9). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~373) and volatility while minimizing excess holding costs given the zero lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in its Spring peak seasonality (late April). Demand has shifted from a pre-Period 2 mean of ~260 to a higher regime. Since Period 2, the demand has averaged approximately 366. The most recent three periods (P8-P10) show demands of 382, 322, and 308, indicating a slight cooling from the peak but remaining well above the initial baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entire Spring regime (starting Period 2) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the currently elevated seasonal demand while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is in the middle of a Spring demand regime that began around Period 2. The current date is April 29th, approaching the peak season for trainer socks. Looking at the demand history since the regime shift (Period 2 to Period 11), the average demand is approximately 372 units. Recent periods (P9-P11) show demands of 322, 308, and 427, indicating continued high but somewhat volatile demand. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture the current seasonal volume and account for recent volatility (especially the spike to 427 in P11), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10, which encompasses the entire Spring regime. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that reflects the current mean and variance while ignoring the lower pre-regime data.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks remains in a high-demand Spring regime. Since the shift in Period 2 (2019/2/18), demand has averaged approximately 385 units per period. The last two periods (P11 and P12) showed a slight increase to 427 and 438 units respectively, coinciding with the approach of warmer weather in May. Lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the entire Spring regime (Period 2 to Period 12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach covers the recent uptick while still keeping the average grounded in the established seasonal level. With on-hand inventory at a very low 4 units, a base stock calculated from the last 11 samples will trigger an order of approximately 400-500 units to meet the current demand trend and maintain the desired service level (q=0.8).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a sustained Spring demand regime. Since Period 2 (mid-February), demand has been elevated compared to the initial baseline. The average demand from Period 2 to Period 13 is approximately 373 units per period. Recent performance shows some volatility, with a high of 438 in Period 12 and a drop to 267 in Period 13. However, given the product type and the current date (May 13), demand is expected to remain firm throughout the late Spring/early Summer. Comparing the post-shift average (~373) and the most recent 3-period average (~377), the regime remains stable. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the entire demand regime since the Period 2 shift (Period 2 to Period 13 = 12 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the higher seasonal mean with the observed volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that satisfies the target service level (80% based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost) for the current period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which are highly relevant for the Spring/Summer season. A demand regime shift was identified around Period 2 (mid-February), shifting from a baseline of ~265 to a higher seasonal level. Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has averaged approximately 343 units with some volatility (range 267-438). The most recent two periods (P13 and P14) show a slight cooling to an average of 271, but given the May date, we must remain prepared for sustained Spring demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent seasonal behavior while filtering shorter-term noise, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current realized volatility. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during Spring and early Summer. Since Period 2 (mid-February), we have been in a higher demand regime. Examining the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been somewhat volatile [427, 438, 267, 275, 348], averaging ~351 units per period. The recent two periods (P13, P14) were lower, but P15 showed a recovery to 348. Given it is late May, we should maintain a robust stock level as trainer sock season is in full swing. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 15 history points. Therefore, current inventory (on-hand 66) needs to be replenished based on the recent demand average. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures the recent volatility and higher mean compared to the lifetime average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Sock', which is highly seasonal towards Spring and early Summer. Current date is June 3rd (Period 17). Historical demand from Period 2 (late Feb) onwards has established a stable Spring regime with demand averaging approximately 356 units. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the average demand is 339.6, and the last 10 periods (P7-P16) average 355 units. Given we are in peak early summer, demand is expected to remain in this range before potentially declining later in the season. On-hand inventory is low (50 units). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand level (approx 355 units) while maintaining sufficient safety stock to handle the observed volatility (standard deviation of ~60). Lead time will be set to calculate based on the perfectly reliable history of 0-period arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which were previously identified in Period 7 as having a Spring demand regime. Looking at the demand from Period 2 through Period 17, the mean demand is approximately 357 units. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand has slightly softened to 311 units, but demand remains volatile (ranging from 267 to 370). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent stabilization and slight decrease in the Spring peak as we move towards early Summer, I will utilize a recent_N window of 8 periods for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This window (P10-P17) captures the most relevant current performance (average ~341 units), balancing the higher late-April/early-May peaks with the slightly lower Junes figures. Period 2 is excluded as it was an extreme outlier (548) at the start of the regime.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand peaked in April/May (P11-P12 avg: 432) and has moderated in late May/early June (P13-P17 avg: 311), though it remains approximately 15% higher than the pre-Spring baseline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a post-peak Spring/early Summer demand regime. Demand peaked in April/May (Period 11-12) and has since stabilized at a lower but consistent level. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the average demand is 308.5 units, which is a clear shift from the earlier Spring peak (avg ~430) and the mid-Spring average (~380). The most recent period (P18) demand was 294. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current stable demand regime following the seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage this historical data.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: From Period 13 to Period 18, demand for trainer socks has stabilized at an average of ~309 units, down from the April/May peak of ~430 but still higher than the pre-Spring baseline of ~265.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically experiences peak demand during Spring and early Summer. Observation of the demand history confirms a high-demand regime from Period 2 (late Feb) through Period 12 (late April), peaking at an average of ~380-430 units. Since Period 13 (May/June), demand has cooled and stabilized. For the most recent 7 periods (P13-P19), demand has averaged 299 units. As we are now in late June (P20), we expect this post-peak stabilization to continue. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture the current stable demand level (avg ~299) and associated volatility, ensuring the base stock level reflects the most recent consumer behavior while maintaining a high service level due to the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has transitioned from its Spring peak (April-May avg: ~430) into a stable Summer regime. Over the most recent 8 periods (P13-P20), demand has averaged 310 units with moderate volatility. This represents a sustained level higher than the pre-Spring baseline (~265) but significantly lower than the seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining responsiveness to current Summer demand levels. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) will provide a volatility estimate consistent with this current regime, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost optimally.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization confirmed: From Period 13 to Period 20, demand has averaged 310 units (approx. 15-20% above pre-Spring baseline), indicating a stable post-peak regime for the trainer socks category.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting a stable summer demand regime for trainer socks. Demand has remained consistent since Period 13, following the Spring peak. Over the last 9 periods (P13-P21), the average demand is 322 units (ranging from 267 to 370). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory at the start of Period 22 is low (24 units), requiring a replenishment order to meet current demand levels. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this stable post-peak summer regime (Periods 13-21) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to optimize the base stock for the OR solver. Using a shorter N would capture too much variance, while a longer N would include the irrelevant April/May peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in late Spring (April/May) as weather warms. Carry-over insights confirm this peak occurred during Periods 11-12 (avg ~432). Since Period 13 (early May), demand has stabilized into a 'Summer regime'. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), demand has averaged 310.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. The most recent demand (P22) was 313, aligning perfectly with this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize for Period 23, I am using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-peak behavior while filtering out the earlier Spring volatility. The base stock calculation will use these parameters to handle the current on-hand inventory of 27 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in the late July summer season (Period 24, July 22). Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in April/May (~430 units) and has since stabilized at a post-peak 'Summer' regime. Since Period 13, the demand has averaged approximately 314 units. However, in the most recent five periods (P19-P23), the average demand is slightly higher at 321 units, with the most recent Period 23 hitting 352 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To address the recent stockout and the stable summer demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 (covering the post-peak period from P13 onwards) to capture the current stable mean. Given the stockout in the previous period, maintaining a sufficient base stock is critical to avoid lost sales at the current $4.0 profit margin vs. $1.0 holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/29 (Late Summer). We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal item that peaked in April/May and has since stabilized into a Summer regime. The carry-over insights correctly identified a post-peak stabilization starting around Period 13 (mid-May). Analyzing the demand from Period 13 through Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 312.3 units. The most recent 3 periods (P22-P24) show an average of 314 units, confirming that the 310-315 range is the current stable state. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime since P13) and recent_N=12 for sigma_hat will capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the earlier Spring peaks. Lead time (L) remains set to default (0).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable post-peak summer regime. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has fluctuated around a mean of approximately 310 units, which is a reduction from the April/May peak (~430 units) but remains above the pre-Spring baseline (~265 units). Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand averages 303 units. Reviewing the calendar (early August), we are approaching the end of summer; however, trainer socks usually maintain stable demand until early Autumn. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' replenishment. I will use a recent_N approach (N=13) to capture the stabilized demand regime since Period 13, which provides a robust estimate of both mean and variance for the current post-peak market condition. This helps the OR engine maintain high service levels while adjusting to the slightly lower consumption rate compared to the Spring peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has entered a late-summer stabilization phase. After peaking in April/May (Period 11-12) and holding a steady average of ~310 units through July, the most recent three periods (P24-P26) have shown a slight decrease to an average of 264 units. This likely signals the beginning of a seasonal transition out of peak trainer sock demand as we move into mid-August. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. I am selecting N=14 for mu_hat (covering roughly the last 3 months) to capture the post-peak summer average while remaining responsive to the recent minor downtick. Sigma_hat is also set to a 14-period lookback to reflect current volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition detected in August: Average demand for the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 264 units, down from the June/July average of ~310, suggesting a seasonal wind-down for trainer socks.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees lower demand as the summer ends and autumn begins. Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high-demand Spring/early Summer regime (averaging ~310-430 units) that has now shifted into a lower late-summer regime. For the last 4 periods (P24-P27), demand has averaged 273 units (277, 256, 258, 301), which is significantly lower than the preceding months and closer to the pre-Spring baseline of ~265. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. To prevent overstocking during this downward seasonal transition, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower late-August demand level while maintaining the L=0 parameter since delivery is immediate.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition confirmed: August demand (P24-P27) has dropped to an average of 273 units, reflecting a post-summer seasonal wind-down for trainer socks compared to the June/July average of ~310.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019 (Period 29). The product is trainer socks, which are transitioning from summer into the autumn season. Historical demand data shows a clear seasonal pattern: initial growth in spring, a peak in April/May (avg ~430), stabilization in June/July (avg ~310), and a recent decline starting in August. For the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 277 units (277, 256, 258, 301, 294), which aligns with the pre-Spring baseline of ~265. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower seasonal baseline accurately while maintaining responsiveness to recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition confirmed: August demand (P24-P28) has returned to the pre-Spring baseline, averaging 277 units, effectively ending the summer seasonal peak.

The average demand from Period 24 to Period 29 is 269 units, which aligns closely with the pre-Spring baseline of ~265-270 units. I am setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent 6-period post-summer regime (Period 24 to Period 29), as this provides the best estimate for current demand levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a post-summer seasonal wind-down. Analysis of the demand history shows that the high Spring/Summer demand has stabilized back toward the pre-Spring baseline. Starting from Period 24 (late July), the demand has averaged approximately 266 units (P24-P30), which is very close to the initial baseline of ~265 units observed in the early periods. Period 30 demand was 274 units, confirming this lower, steadier regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established 'Autumn' baseline while filtering out the previous summer peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has stabilized following the summer peak. The Carry-over Insights indicate a transition back to the pre-Spring baseline (approx. 265-275 units) starting around Period 28/29. The most recent three periods (P29-P31) show demands of 229, 274, and 254, averaging 252 units. This confirms the seasonal wind-down. Given the current date is mid-September and the product is a seasonal accessory, I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 4 periods (P28-P31) to capture this lower, stable autumn regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in a post-summer demand regime. Carry-over insights from Period 29 confirmed that demand returned to the pre-Spring baseline of ~277 units starting in late August. For the most recent 4 periods (P29-P32), demand has averaged 251.25 units (range: 229-274), which aligns with this baseline. We are now in late September (Sept 23), and the demand appears stable. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of the current baseline, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-volatility, post-summer regime. This will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock level sufficient to meet demand around 250-270 units while keeping holding costs low as the seasonal peak has passed.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is in a post-summer demand regime. While Carry-over Insights for Period 29 suggested a return to the pre-Spring baseline (~265-277 units), Period 33 observed a significant demand spike to 405 units on September 23rd. This spike is likely a temporary fluctuation or a minor seasonal event (e.g., late September cooling or promotional activity) rather than a sustained regime shift, as the four periods prior (P29-P32) averaged 251 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, which incorporates this recent spike without overreacting to it as a permanent shift. The lead time remains reliably 0 based on consistent historical arrivals.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an Autumn demand regime. While August and early September saw demand return to the pre-Spring baseline of ~265-275 units, there has been a recent uptick in volatility: Period 33 demand was 405 (a spike) and Period 34 was 312. This likely represents a minor 'back-to-school' or 'early Autumn transition' fluctuation. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is 287 units. Since demand is currently higher than the base 265 but lower than the 310-430 Summer peaks, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture this moderate stabilization. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by continuous 'ordered=X, arrived=X' same-period completions. Setting L to default (0) and using recent_N (6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR engine to account for the recent rise in both mean and variance without overreacting to the P33 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization: From Period 29 to Period 34, demand has averaged 287 units, slightly above the pre-Spring baseline (~265) but significantly below the Summer peak, with increased volatility noted in late September.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an Autumn demand regime (October). Past performance shows that after the summer peak, demand has stabilized around a mean of ~287 units (P29-P35 avg). Specifically, since Period 29, the demand sequence is [229, 274, 254, 248, 405, 312, 266], which averages 284 units. There was a notable spike in Period 33 (405 units), suggesting increased volatility in late September/early October, possibly due to promotional activity or seasonal stocking. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current date (October 14) and the product type (fine-knit trainer socks), demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as colder weather approaches. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current post-summer stabilization while accounting for the recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in recent weeks. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in an Autumn demand regime, following a seasonal wind-down from the Summer peak. Periods 29-36 show a stabilized demand average of 278 units, very close to the pre-Spring baseline of ~265. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory calculation: currently 94 units on hand, 0 in transit. To set the base stock for the next period, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable Autumn regime (Periods 29-36). This will set mu_hat at approximately (1+0)*278 = 278. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to account for recent volatility, particularly the spike in Period 33.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable post-summer demand regime. Since Period 29, representing late August through October, demand has averaged approximately 280 units (P29-P37 mean = 281.5), which is very close to the pre-Spring baseline. There was a notable spike in Period 33 (405 units) and a moderate increase in Period 37 (306 units), suggesting some late-season volatility, but the overall trend is consistent. Lead time remains reliably 0 periods. For Period 38 (late October), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. Mu_hat will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the period since the Autumn transition in Period 29) to capture the current mean demand of ~282 units. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to properly account for the observed volatility in this regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for the end-of-month demand fluctuations.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 4th, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see a seasonal decline as colder weather approaches in late autumn. Since Period 29 (late August), demand has stabilized into an autumn regime, averaging approximately 283 units (P29-P38 average). The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show a very similar average of 280 units, suggesting the regime is stable despite some volatility in late September (P33). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. Given the relatively low holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), the OR engine will target a service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). Current on-hand inventory is 52 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current autumn demand regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable Autumn regime. Since Period 29 (late August), demand has stabilized around the pre-Spring baseline. Over the last 11 periods (P29-P39), demand has averaged 283 units. While there was a volatility spike in Period 33 (405 units), recent demand has been consistent with this baseline (P35-P39 average: 266 units). Lead time remains reliably at 0 periods as confirmed by all past conclude messages. Given the date is mid-November, we are entering a period where 'trainer socks' might see a slight dip due to colder weather, or potentially a small spike for holiday gifting; however, current evidence supports maintaining a stable baseline. I will use a N=11 period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-summer regime while tempering the effect of the Period 33 outlier. Lead time is set to 0 (default).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Trainer Socks) has exited its high-demand Spring/Summer peaks and transitioned into a stable Autumn/Winter regime. Since Period 35 (early October), demand has been consistently moderate and stable, averaging 263.5 units over the last 6 periods (P35-P40: 266, 240, 306, 276, 241, 252). This level is very close to the pre-Spring baseline of ~265 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized current demand while allowing for the standard variance seen in recent weeks (e.g., the P37 spike to 306), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the model on the most relevant recent post-transition data. L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter stabilization confirmed: Demand from Period 35 to Period 40 has averaged 263.5 units, effectively returning to the pre-Spring baseline with reduced volatility compared to September.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which historically showed a strong demand peak in Spring (April/May) and has since moderated. The 'Autumn/Winter stabilization' regime identified in the carry-over insights at Period 41 is holding steady, with recent demand (P35-P41) averaging approximately 256 units. The most recent demand (P41) was 210, continuing a slight downward trend into late November. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize for the currently lower, stable demand while protecting against standard volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the period since mid-October, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect current volatility levels. This approach avoids overstocking during a low seasonal period where holding costs ($1) are relatively high compared to profit ($4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1128.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks in Period 42 spiked to 354, departing from the stable Autumn/Winter average of ~263 seen from Periods 35-41. This coincides with late November/early December (Cyber Monday/pre-Christmas shopping), suggesting a potential short-term seasonal boost. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to the demand surge and a lower order quantity in Period 42. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set parameters that replenish stock to meet this elevated demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the stabilized Autumn period + the recent spike) to capture both the baseline and the recent volatility while allowing the OR engine to react to the potential seasonal uptick.

Carry-over insight: Early December demand spike: Period 42 demand (354) is 35% higher than the P35-P41 average (263), likely reflecting holiday season patterns for socks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early December (Period 44). Last period's demand (P43) was unusually low at 143, contrasting with a spike to 354 in P42. Given the 'product_description' involves trainer socks, they are likely popular for gift-giving or stocking stuffers, explaining the volatility as we approach the Christmas peak. The P42 spike (354) and the P43 dip (143) average to 248.5, which is close to the Autumn/Winter baseline (263.5). However, retail logic suggests demand will surge in the 2 weeks before Christmas. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 9 (capturing the lead up to December and the recent volatility) to buffer against the anticipated holiday peak while acknowledging that lead time remains consistently 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 will also reflect the increased volatility observed in the last two periods, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the middle of the holiday season for trainer socks. Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (354 units), likely a pre-holiday surge, followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (143) and a moderate levels in Period 44 (209). This volatility is typical for December. Historical pre-Spring and Autumn baselines are around 265 units. However, trainer socks as a product category often see secondary spikes just before Christmas and during post-Christmas sales. Given that lead time is consistently 0, the primary risk is under-stocking for a potential final December surge. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current volatile regime (P35-P44 mean: 253), but I will explicitly set sigma_hat higher to account for the high volatility observed in P42-43 (standard deviation of the last 10 periods is approx 58, whereas the last 3 periods vary wildly). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time stability.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the peak of the Christmas holiday season. Historically, demand for trainer socks showed a spike in early December (P42: 354 units), followed by a sharp drop and stabilization (P43-P45 avg: 194 units). However, the dates Dec 23 - Dec 30 (Period 46) often see a secondary spike due to last-minute shopping and gift-giving, followed by a potential drop in the next period. The 'Spring/Summer' peak was around 300-400 units, while the 'Autumn/Winter' baseline is around 260. Given the recent drop to an average of 194 units over the last three periods, but keeping in mind the volatility of the holiday season, I will use a recent_N approach. I'll set N=4 to capture the early December spike and the subsequent correction, balancing the forecast. Lead time is consistently 0.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P47 (Dec 30, 2019), representing the final week of the year and the end of the holiday season for trainer socks. Looking at the December data (P43-P46), demand has averaged 201.75 units (143, 209, 231, 224), which is significantly lower than the early December spike anticipated in P42 (354) and also below the autumn/winter baseline of ~263 units. This suggests the holiday peak for this specific SKU was short-lived or shifted earlier, followed by a seasonal lull at year-end. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this lower-demand year-end transition, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4), capturing the current post-holiday baseline of ~202 units. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P43-P46) averaged ~202 units, reflecting a post-holiday dip compared to the autumn/winter baseline of ~263 units.
