Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], showing a mean of 266.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. There are no concluded periods yet to verify lead time, so I will stick to the promised lead time (L=2). Since this is the first decision and demand appears relatively stable, I will use all available historical samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach provides a robust starting point for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 310 units was placed but hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time is 2). Demand in Period 1 was 287, which was lost because on-hand inventory was 0. Historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] plus the P1 demand (287) shows a stable mean around 270. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3. For the OR parameters, I will use the promised lead time (L=2). I'll use the mean of all available demand data (including P1) to set mu_hat. Given the stable demand history, recent_N with N=5 (capturing the most recent data points including the P1 observation) is appropriate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand level of ~270 units per period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. History shows a promised lead time of 2, but Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (actual lead time = 1). Historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] was around 266, but Period 1 and 2 observed demand spiked to 287 and 548 respectively. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', and the current date (Feb 25) precedes Spring. The recent demand of 548 in Period 2 suggests a significant upward shift or seasonal trend. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently stock-out (sold 310 of 548 demand), we need to aggressively increase the base stock. I will use a lead time L=1 based on the observed arrival, and an explicit mu_hat reflecting the recent high demand (avg of 287 and 548 is ~417, so mu_hat for L+1 = 2 periods is 834) to ensure the backend orders enough to cover the trend while accounting for the current pipeline of 307 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from historical avg ~266 to 417 over the last 2 periods (+56%). Lead time for P1 was 1 period instead of promised 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', and we are entering March. Historical demand was ~266, but the last two periods saw 548 and 399 (avg ~473), indicating a significant upward shift, likely due to seasonal transition to spring wear. Both orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, rather than the promised 2. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 627 units in transit (ordered P3, expected to arrive during P4). Demand is outstripping supply, leading to stockouts. I will set L to 'explicit' value 1 to reflect the observed reality, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~411 for P1-P3), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this shift.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently 1 period (confirmed P1->P2 and P2->P3). Demand regime shifted significantly higher starting P2, coinciding with seasonal transition to spring trainer socks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is entering the spring season (March), which explains the significant demand spike observed since Period 2. Historical demand before the shift was ~266, but the average of the last 4 periods is 393. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply and a possible delay or loss of the Period 3 order. While Period 1 and 2 orders arrived with an actual lead time of 1 (instead of the promised 2), the Period 3 order (627 units) did not arrive in Period 4. This indicates either a reversion to the promised lead time of 2 or a lost/delayed shipment. Given the critical stock-out (on-hand 0), I am setting L to 2 (promised/explicit) to ensure the OR engine calculates a base stock covering the full lead time. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime (+47% vs historical) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lead time instability detected; after two periods of L=1, P3 order did not arrive in P4, suggesting a return to L=2 or a shipment delay. Demand remains in high-regime (avg ~393) consistent with spring seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (March 18, 2019). The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', which is moving into its peak spring season. Historical demand in the first 3 periods showed a significant spike (avg ~411), but the last two periods have moderated (avg ~295). Looking at all 10 available demand points [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287, 548, 399, 338, 252], the mean is approx 315. Regarding lead time: P1 and P2 arrived with L=1, but P3 arrived with L=2 (confirmed in P5 conclude). The P4 order (352 units) has not arrived yet; if L=2, it should arrive during P6 and be visible in P7. I will set L to 'default' (2 periods) as the earlier L=1 was likely an anomaly or a best-case scenario. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher seasonal demand plateau (avg ~358) compared to the very early history. This will result in mu_hat = (1+2)*358 = 1074. Sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reverted to promised 2 periods (P3 order arrived P5). Demand has stabilized at a higher seasonal mean of ~350-360 compared to the initial 260 baseline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are entering the peak spring season for trainer socks. Current on-hand inventory is low (46 units) following a demand of 329 in Period 6. Historical demand analysis: Periods 1-6 show a mean of ~358, but with significant volatility (range 252-548). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P2-P6) represent the 'Spring' regime with an average of 373. Lead time (L) has fluctuated: P1 and P2 orders arrived with L=1, but P3 arrived with L=2. P4 (ordered Period 4, promised L=2) is expected to arrive in Period 6's resolution, becoming visible in Period 7's conclude message. Based on this, L=2 is the safest estimate. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher spring demand level (373 * (1+L) = 1119). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the high variance observed during this regime shift, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 2-4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is entering its peak spring season (April 1st). Demand has consistently outpaced supply, leading to frequent stockouts. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 1,236 units in transit. Demand over the last 7 periods (287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329, 415) averages 366.8, which is significantly higher than the initial historical mean of ~266. The most recent demand (415) indicates the seasonal ramp-up is continuing. Regarding lead time, we have observed both 1-period (P1, P2) and 2-period (P3) arrivals. The P4 order (352 units) has not arrived as of P7 conclude, meaning its lead time is at least 3 periods, or it is delayed. Given this uncertainty and the high stockout risk, I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend targets a higher base stock. I'll estimate demand for the next (L+1)=3 periods at approximately 400 per period (total 1200) to cover the seasonal peak and recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: P4 order (ordered Period 4) is overdue as of Period 7 conclude (L >= 3), suggesting potential shipping delays or lead time extension beyond the promised 2 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), we are in the peak season for trainer socks. Current demand has stabilized at a high regime (avg ~350-380). Observation of recent arrivals in Period 8 shows massive volatility: the P4 order is missing (ordered P4, now P9, lead time > 4 periods), while P5, P6, and P7 all arrived simultaneously in Period 8. This indicates a 'bottleneck and release' supply chain pattern rather than a consistent 2-period lead time. Despite the P4 order likely being lost or severely delayed, the simultaneous arrival of three later orders has left us with 502 units on hand and 460 in transit (P8 order + others). I will set L=3 to account for the supply instability and the missing P4 shipment. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (~343/period * (1+3) = 1372). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to handle the increased demand volatility seen during the spring transition.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain 'clumping' detected: Orders P5 (L=3), P6 (L=2), and P7 (L=1) all arrived in Period 8. Order P4 (placed Period 4) is confirmed missing/lost as of Period 9 decision phase (L > 4).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are in the peak season for cotton-blend trainer socks. Current demand analysis shows a stable high-regime mean of ~355 units (average of last 8 periods is 373, but recent fluctuations suggest a mean around 350-360). Order P4 is confirmed lost (ordered P4, now P10, no arrival). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with 'clumping' occurring in Period 8. Given this instability and the confirmed loss of a shipment, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current spring seasonal level (avg ~350). The sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in this seasonal regime. The pipeline inventory (905) is high, but much of that is the recent large orders from P8/P9 meant to recover from stockouts and the lost P4 shipment. On-hand is 180, which is below one period's demand, making arrival timing critical.

The current date is April 22nd, 2019. This SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) is in a high-demand seasonal regime for spring, with an average demand of approximately 342 units over the last 5 periods (P6-P10). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after Period 10, meaning we are experiencing stockouts. Lead time has been highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a missing shipment (Order P4). The 'in-transit' total is 931 units, representing orders from P8 (108), P9 (445), and P10 (26). Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P8 order (108 units) should have arrived in Period 10 but didn't. Given the volatility and the need to bridge the stockout gap, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect recent delays and use a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current seasonal demand level (~342/period). This results in a mu_hat covering 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/4/29. We are in the peak spring/summer season for trainer socks. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 353 units, showing sustained high volume compared to the early-year baseline. Lead time is volatile: P9 arrived on time (L=2), but P4 remains lost, and P10 (ordered P10, promised L=2) did not arrive in Period 11's conclusion, meaning it will arrive in Period 12 at the earliest (L>=2). The total pipeline inventory of 912 likely includes the P10 order (26) and P11 order (426) plus perhaps a residual or ghost transit from the lost P4 order, though we must focus on recent arrivals. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base but set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (last 7 periods avg ~360) to ensure the base stock level (1+L)*mu covers the expected demand during the lead time and review period. Sigma_hat is set using the last 7 periods to capture current seasonal volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (trainer socks) is currently in a high-demand seasonal regime (Spring/Summer), with the last two periods showing demand of 427 and 438, significantly higher than the previous average of ~350. We are currently out of stock (Ending On-hand: 0). Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with one lost shipment (Period 4). The Period 11 order (426 units) was expected to arrive in Period 12 (if L=1) but didn't; it is now expected in the current Period 13 (L=2). To address the recent demand surge and ensure the OR backend covers enough inventory for the lead time plus the review period, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent average demand of ~430 per period over (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use the promised lead time L=2 for the backend calculation while setting mu_hat to (2+1)*430 = 1290. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Recent demand (P11-P12) has increased to ~430 units/period, up from the previous high-regime average of ~350 (+23%).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13, 2019), we are in a high-demand seasonal window for trainer socks. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (Periods 12 and 13). The order from Period 10 (26 units) is now overdue (L=3+), and the order from Period 11 (426 units) should ideally arrive this period (L=2) or next. Demand shows significant volatility but a clear step-up in May. While Period 13 demand dropped to 267, this followed a period of 438, suggesting potential data noise or stockout-related reporting artifacts; the average of the last 3 periods remains high (~377). I will set L to 'calculate' to account for recent shipping instability and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the higher seasonal mean (~370) while allowing for the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both current high demand and lead time uncertainty.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (trainer socks) is in its peak spring/early summer season (current date: 2019/05/20). Demand analysis shows a high-regime mean of approximately 360-430 units, though the last two periods (P13-P14) saw a slight dip to ~270. This dip might be due to stockouts affecting perceived demand or a short-term fluctuation, as on-hand inventory has been 0 for most of those periods. Actual lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (P9->P11, P12->P14). Order P10 (placed Period 10, 26 units) is now overdue (L > 4), confirming it as likely lost, and P11 (426 units) is also overdue (L=4), suggesting ongoing supply chain volatility. Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the need to cover (L+1) periods of demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (which covers the high-demand regime) to capture the seasonal average of ~340. Setting L=2 (promised) as it remains the modal lead time, despite the lost/delayed P10/P11 orders.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: P10 (26 units) confirmed lost (L>4); P11 (426 units) overdue (L=4). Demand remains seasonally high (~340 avg over last 5 periods) despite recent stockout-driven variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in a peak seasonal window for 'trainer socks'. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~351 units, despite stockouts potentially masking true demand in Periods 13 and 15. The supply chain remains highly unstable. Specifically: P10 (26 units) is lost (L>5), P11 (426 units) is severely overdue (L=5), and P13 (259 units) is also potentially delayed (L=3). There are currently 1171 units in-transit (P11, P13, P14-0, P15-0), but none have arrived in the last period. To account for this instability, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the recent realized delays (P11 is already at L=5, but L=3 covers the likely arrival window for the rest of the pipeline). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*350 = 1400 using the recent 5-period mean to ensure the base stock covers the extended lead time and high seasonal demand. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility caused by both demand shifts and supply inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: P11 (ordered Period 11) is now 3 periods past promised delivery (L=5), confirming that the supply chain is experiencing significant delays beyond the baseline L=2.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd (Period 17), entering peak summer season for trainer socks. Demand remains robust, averaging approximately 340-350 units over the last 6 periods (including stockout periods which likely underestimate true latent demand). Inventory is currently 0, with 1,537 units in transit. The supply chain remains highly unstable: Order P11 (ordered Period 11) is now 5 periods overdue (L=6) and P10 (ordered Period 10) is confirmed lost. Because P11, P12, P13, and P16 are still 'in-transit', the pipeline is heavily inflated. I am setting L to an explicit value of 4 to reflect the current reality of significant delays (P11 is already at L=6, but P12 arrived in 2). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand summer regime (approx 350/period) while ignoring the earlier baseline. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 80 to account for high demand volatility caused by stockouts and inconsistent delivery arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain delay confirmed: P11 (ordered P11) has not arrived as of P16 conclude, meaning L > 5 for that specific shipment, though P12 arrived on time (L=2). Demand regime remains high for summer season (~350 units/period).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10th), we are in peak summer demand for trainer socks. Current demand has stabilized in a high-regime range (avg ~340-350) despite stockout-driven noise. The supply chain remains highly unstable: we have a massive amount of inventory in-transit (1473 units) comprising several older orders (P11, P13) which are significantly overdue (L > 5). However, P16 arrived in only 1 period, and P17 (302 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P18) if L=1, or next period (P19) if L=2. Because the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), the huge 'in-transit' figure (which includes the likely lost P10 and the extremely overdue P11/P13) will suppress new orders to zero. To ensure we continue to maintain stock against current demand while the pipeline clears or settles, I am setting an 'explicit' lead time of 2 (promised) to stabilize the window, and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1050 (representing (1+L)*350) to reflect the summer demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to account for the high variance and delivery instability observed in the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation: Recent orders (P16) show L=1, while older orders (P11, P13) remain stuck in-transit (L > 5), creating a misleadingly high pipeline inventory total of 1473 units. Summer demand for trainer socks is confirmed stable at ~350 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (mid-June), demand for trainer socks remains stable within the summer high-regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 316.8, which accounts for some stockout periods. When looking at periods with full availability (P17-P18), demand is consistently around 295. I will set mu_hat based on a recent average (N=5) to capture this current trend (~317/period). Regarding lead time, there is a clear bifurcation: recent orders (P16, P17) arrived with L=1, while several older orders (P4, P10, P11, P13) are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed. The 'In-transit' count of 1171 is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the high pipeline inventory, I must set 'L' to 'explicit' with a high value. By setting L=5, I increase the base stock target (mu_hat * (1+L)) to roughly 1900 units, which exceeds the current pipeline (1171) plus on-hand (77), triggering an order to maintain stock for the summer peak.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for trainer socks remains stable in the high-summer regime, averaging ~340-350 units over the last 5 periods (excluding stockout-induced zero sales). The supply chain remains highly bifurcated and unreliable. The 'In-transit' total of 1554 is heavily inflated by 'ghost' shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15) which are long overdue and likely lost. Specifically, P11 (ordered P11) is now 8 periods old, and P13 is 6 periods old. However, recent orders P16 and P17 arrived with L=1. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units in the pipeline, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 2 to match the promised lead time, and set 'mu_hat' explicitly to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the current summer rate (~350 * 3 = 1050). By using explicit values, I can bypass the OR backend's default pipeline calculation which would otherwise subtract the 1554 'in-transit' units from the base stock and result in zero orders, leading to further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: Recent orders (P16, P17) show L=1, while older orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15) totaling approx. 1100 units are confirmed lost/missing (L > 5). Demand regime for trainer socks is stable at ~350 units/period.

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the demand for trainer socks remains stable in the summer high-regime, averaging approximately 342 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). However, the inventory situation is critical: we have 0 on-hand inventory and a massive reported 'In-transit' figure of 1554 units. Analysis of the history confirms that 1104 of these units (from P4, P10, P11, P13, and P15) are lost/phantom shipments as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2. Recent arrivals (P17 and P18) arrived with L=1, but P19 (383 units) has not arrived in P20, suggesting L is currently closer to 2. To prevent the OR backend from 'starving' the system because it thinks 1554 units are coming, I am setting L to 2 (the promised lead time which aligns with recent patterns) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the ~340 unit demand. The sigma_hat is set via recent_N to reflect the volatility seen in the summer demand periods. This strategy aims to trigger a replenishment order to cover the 0 on-hand position, ignoring the lost pipeline inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th (Summer). Demand for trainer socks remains stable in the 'high summer regime' with an average of approximately 324 units over the last 5 periods (excluding stockouts). The primary challenge is supply chain instability and 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, and P15 (totaling ~1100 units) have not arrived for 5-18 periods and are definitively lost. The OR engine's 'capped policy' subtracts the entire 'In-transit' (1171) from the base stock. If we allow it to see 1171 in-transit, it will place an order of 0, despite only 0 units (since P19 arrived) being actually expected. To force the OR backend to place a necessary order for the current demand, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and pipeline is inflated by ~1100 lost units, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset this ghost inventory. Estimated required base stock to cover L+1 (3 periods) at 325 units/period is ~975. However, since the engine will subtract 1171, I will set mu_hat to 1600 to ensure a meaningful order is placed to maintain availability for the remainder of the summer season. L is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the volatile actual lead times (1, 1, 2, etc.) seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders P4, P10, P11, P13, and P15 (~1100 units total); pipeline inventory is significantly inflated. Summer demand remains stable at ~325 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, demand for Women's Trainer Socks has stabilized in a summer regime averaging approximately 315 units per period (last 5 periods: 294, 334, 289, 317, 313). However, the system faces a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge. The 'In-transit' balance of 1557 units includes 1171 units from orders placed in Periods 4, 8, 10, 11, and 13 that are long overdue and confirmed lost/missing. The only valid pipeline inventory is the 386 units ordered in Period 22. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1557) from the base stock, it will fail to order necessary units unless mu_hat is significantly inflated to offset the 1171 phantom units. To maintain a real-world base stock covering L+1 periods (3 periods * 315 units = 945) while accounting for the 1557 units the backend thinks we have, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target Base Stock = 945 (real need) + 1171 (offset) = 2116. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current stability in demand volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22, peak summer season for 'fine-knit trainer socks'. Demand remains stable in the high regime, with an average of approximately 324 units over the last 5 periods (P19-P23: 334, 289, 317, 313, 352). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 2143 units is highly misleading due to confirmed lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, and now likely P18/P20 which were $0 orders but effectively block the pipeline logic). Specifically, orders totaling ~1100 units from earlier periods are confirmed lost. Recent arrivals (P16, P17, P19) show lead times of 1, 1, and 2 periods respectively, averaging L=1.33. However, given the frequent stockouts and the OR backend's inability to 'forget' lost pipeline inventory, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force an order. I will set L to the promised 2 periods to ensure a 3-period coverage (L+1). mu_hat is set to 1050 (350 * 3) to reflect current summer demand levels. sigma_hat is set to 100 to provide a safety buffer against the high demand variance observed during stockout recovery phases.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29 (Period 25). The product (fine-knit trainer socks) is in peak summer demand. Historical data shows demand is stable in a high regime averaging ~328 units/period over the last 10 periods (P15-P24). However, the supply chain is highly unstable. As confirmed in Carry-Over Insights, orders P4, P10, P11, P13, and P15 (approx. 1100 units) are lost, yet they remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. The 'In-transit' figure of 2143 units is heavily inflated. To force an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting L to 5 (explicit) to increase the base stock calculation, mu_hat to a high explicit value based on the current regime (328 units * (5+1) = 1968), and sigma_hat to a high explicit value to account for the extreme supply volatility. This compensates for the ~1100 lost units and ensures the backend places an order to cover the current stockout (on-hand is 0).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by ~1100 units from confirmed lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15). Demand regime stable at ~330 units/period for summer season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), we are entering the tail end of the peak summer season for trainer socks. Current demand has slightly softened from the previous regime of ~350-430 down to ~250-280 in the last two periods (P24: 277, P25: 256). The critical issue remains the massive pipeline inflation. The 'In-transit' figure of 2263 units includes approximately 1100 units from confirmed lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15) which have not arrived for 10+ periods. Additionally, orders P22 (386), P23 (586), and P25 (120) are currently within or just past the promised lead time of 2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to the 'ghost' pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L to account for recent instability, and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the on-hand is currently 0 and recent demand is ~265, I need to ensure the system targets a base stock that ignores the ~1100 units of lost stock. Setting mu_hat to a value that reflects (1+L) * 330 while the OR backend sees 2263 in transit is risky; however, I must signal a higher demand requirement to force the order logic to bypass the dead inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected in late summer (P24-P25): Avg ~265 units/period compared to previous summer avg of ~330 (-20%). Pipeline remains inflated by ~1100 units of confirmed lost stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019-08-12. The product is trainer socks, which are transitioning from peak summer demand to a late-summer/early-autumn softening phase. Recent demand (P24-P26) has averaged ~264 units, down from the summer peak of ~330-350. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 2263 units; however, historical analysis confirms approximately 1100 units are 'lost' (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15 have exceeded a lead time of 5-10+ periods). The active pipeline consists of orders from P22 (386), P23 (586), and P25 (120), totaling 1092 units. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly suppressing orders due to the 'lost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. This compensates for the fact that the backend formula [base_stock - pipeline] sees 2263 units when it should only see ~1092. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P19) suggest lead times are stabilizing closer to the norm. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods (L+1) at the current softened demand rate (~265 * 3 = 795) plus a buffer of 1100 to offset the phantom pipeline units, totaling 1895. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen during stockout periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening confirmed as of P26: Late-summer average demand is ~265, down from peak summer ~330. Phantom pipeline inventory remains constant at ~1100 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 28 (mid-August). Demand has stabilized into a late-summer regime, averaging approximately 273 units/period over the last four weeks (P24-P27: 277, 256, 258, 301). The primary issue is a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 2263 units, which consists almost entirely of lost or severely delayed shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, and P23). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the target base stock, it will continue to order 0 units despite on-hand inventory being 0, leading to a perpetual stockout. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the desired base stock plus the volume of the phantom pipeline. A healthy base stock for (L+1=3) periods at ~275 units/period is ~825 units. To force an order of ~400-500 units when the backend subtracts 2263, I must set mu_hat significantly higher. target_order = mu_hat - pipeline. If target_order should be ~500 and pipeline is 2263, mu_hat needs to be ~2763. I will set mu_hat to 2800 to ensure the capped policy allows a sufficient replenishment order to break the stockout. Sigma is set to reflect the standard deviation of the recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 2263 is entirely 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23). Demand regime is stable at ~275 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late August 2019. Demand for trainer socks has softened from peak summer levels (~330) to a more stable late-summer regime (avg ~275 over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline is extremely inflated at 2858 units. Analysis of history confirms that orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, and P23 (totaling approximately 2263 units) are lost or permanently delayed, as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, P22/P23 should have arrived by now. To ensure the OR backend places a new order despite the 'phantom' pipeline, I am setting an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 275 = 825. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from base_stock, and the pipeline is artificially high, I must use 'explicit' values to force an order. Since the OR engine's 'cap' also limits orders, I'll target a base stock that covers immediate demand needs while accounting for the fact that current in-transit stock is non-functional. I will set L to the promised 2 periods as recent successful arrivals (P19) adhered to it, though the system is unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P24-P28) confirmed stable at ~275 units/period. Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23) is confirmed at 2263 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), we are entering the post-summer/early-autumn period for trainer socks. Demand has settled into a late-summer regime (approx. 275 units/period) compared to the peak summer average (~330). The 'In-transit' figure of 3227 is highly misleading due to a massive volume of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. Specifically, orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, and P25 (totaling 2263 units) are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and must be considered lost based on previous patterns. This leaves an effective pipeline of 964 units (orders P28 and P29), which are still within a plausible delivery window given the observed lead-time volatility. Since on-hand inventory is 0, I must set parameters that force the OR backend to place an order despite the high reported pipeline. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering the late-summer shift), and keeping L at the default promised lead time of 2 (as most surviving shipments eventually arrive around L=1-3), the OR engine will better reflect current demand. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the ~330 summer peak to the ~270 late-summer levels.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P24-P29) stable at ~270 units/period. Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25) is now 2383 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand for trainer socks has softened as we transition from peak summer to early autumn, with the last 7 periods (P24-P30) averaging approximately 270 units/period. The main challenge remains the extreme supply chain instability: the system reports 3227 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms that approximately 2383 units are 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25). Orders P28 (595 units) and P29 (369 units) are still within a plausible delivery window (L=2-3), but on-hand inventory is currently 0. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive 3227 in-transit figure and refusing to order, I must set L to an 'explicit' high value. By setting L=10, the backend's base_stock calculation (mu_hat * (1+L)) will likely exceed the phantom pipeline, triggering a fresh order to meet the current demand of ~270/period. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*270 to reflect the late-summer/early-autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, total confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 2383 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25). Recent demand regime (P24-P30) is stable at ~270 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/09/16), we are entering the mid-September period for trainer socks. Demand has settled into a late-summer/early-autumn regime, with the last 7 periods (P25-P31) showing a stable mean of approximately 266 units/period (256, 258, 301, 294, 229, 274, 254). The massive 'in-transit' figure of 2263 is heavily skewed by the ~1100 units from confirmed lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15) and several other aging orders from the July/August period (P22, P23, P25) that have likely also been lost given they are 6-10 periods past their order date. Since P28 and P29 successfully arrived in P31 (with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively), the supply chain seems to have recovered for new orders. To prevent the OR backend from 'starving' the inventory based on the phantom pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the current regime (3 periods * 266 = 798), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility. Note: The OR engine will subtract the 2263 'in-transit' units from the base stock; to ensure an order is actually placed if needed, I must adjust the parameters, but given on-hand is currently 710 (nearly 3 weeks of stock), I will stick to the statistical reality and allow the inventory to bleed down before placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, total confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 2383 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25). Recent demand regime (P24-P31) is stable at ~266 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (late September), demand for trainer socks has settled into a stable post-summer regime. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P24-P32) is approximately 266 units, a significant decrease from the summer peak of ~330-350. On-hand inventory is 462 units, which covers nearly two periods of demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2263 units is highly inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25), as documented in previous carry-over insights. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously suppressing orders due to this false pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows me to manually set the base stock level (approximately 850 units for L=2) and ensure the order quantity (base stock - on-hand - ACTUAL in-transit) is calculated correctly. Since actual in-transit is currently 0 (P28 and P29 arrived in P31), the OR engine will compare the calculated base stock against the 462 on-hand and 2263 phantom in-transit. To bypass this, I set mu_hat high enough to trigger the necessary replenishment or rely on the fact that current stock is sufficient for the immediate lead time while the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 2383 units as of Period 32. Late-season demand (Sept) is stable at ~260 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019/9/30 (late Sept). Demand in Period 33 spiked to 405 units, departing from the recent late-summer regime of ~265 units. This could indicate a back-to-school or seasonal transition for trainer socks. Inventory: On-hand is low (57 units). In-transit is 2263, but per carry-over insights, this is 'phantom' pipeline from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25). To the OR backend, the pipeline looks full, so it will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this phantom inventory. However, the OR backend logic is capped. Because we need to trigger an order despite the 2263 phantom units, and the OR engine uses 'base_stock - pipeline', I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for both the anticipated demand (3 periods at ~300 avg) and to offset the phantom pipeline. Lead time: Promised is 2, but recent arrivals (P31) showed L=2 and L=3. I will use L=2 (default). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the increased volatility seen in the P33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in P33 (405 units), potentially signaling a seasonal shift from the late-summer ~265 average. Phantom pipeline remains at 2383 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the SKU 372860001 is facing a stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand shows a shift from the late-summer average (~265) to a higher October regime, with P33 at 405 and P34 at 312 (avg ~358). This aligns with seasonal transitions in hosiery. The pipeline inventory (3315 units) is heavily inflated by 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25), totaling 2383 units. Subtracting this phantom stock leaves an actual effective pipeline of 932 units (Order P34 of 1052 is not yet reflected in the 3315 total, or more likely, the 3315 already includes recent orders). To force the OR backend to place a corrective order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock for (L+1=3) periods using a forecast of 360 units/period (360 * 3 = 1080). To bypass the phantom pipeline of 2383, I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 2383) produces the desired order quantity. To cover the current stockout and expected demand while the P34 order is in transit, I'm setting mu_hat significantly higher to ensure the backend generates an order.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed moving into October: P33-P34 avg 358 units, up from late-summer avg 265 (+35%). Phantom pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 2383 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the system is facing a total stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand shows a shift from the late-summer average of ~265 to a higher October regime. P33-P34 averaged 358 units, though P35 showed a dip to 266 (likely limited by zero stock/observation noise). I am forecasting a mean demand of 340 units for the current period and lead time. The most critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, and P25 are significantly past their promised 2-period lead time and are confirmed lost. These total 2383 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' total (3595) from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless I use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. To force an order that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) despite the 2383 units of lost stock, I am setting mu_hat to 3403 (calculated as (3 * 340) + 2383). This ensures the OR engine's logic [base_stock - pipeline] results in a positive order to replenish the physical stockout. L is kept at 2 as recent successful deliveries (P28, P29) arrived with lead times of 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, total confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 2383 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25). October demand regime is confirmed higher at ~340 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21), we are entering a late October phase. The demand analysis shows a recent average of approximately 305 units over the last 4 periods (P33-P36), which is higher than the late-summer baseline but lower than the initial Oct spike. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this current trend. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' total of 3595 units is severely inflated by 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25), which total 2383 units. This leaves an actual functional pipeline of 1212 units (P34 order of 1052 and P35 order of 280). Since 1212 units covers roughly 4 periods of demand and on-hand is 0, the backend capped policy might prevent necessary ordering if I don't adjust parameters. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P28, P29) arrived within 2-3 periods. I am using mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods to reflect the stabilized October demand and account for the high variance seen in P33.

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilized at ~305 units/period (P33-P36). Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains 2383 units; effective pipeline is 1212 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent demand in October has stabilized at a mean of approximately 270-300 units (P34-P37: 312, 266, 240, 306), following a brief spike in P33. The critical issue remains the massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total In-transit is 3595 units, but history shows that orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, and P25 (totaling 2383 units) are definitively lost as their lead times have exceeded 5-10+ periods. The effective pipeline consists of P34 (1052 units) and P35 (280 units), totaling 1332 units. Since the OR engine's capped policy subtracts the full pipeline (3595) from the base stock, it will not place new orders despite the stockout unless mu_hat is set to override this. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for (1+L) periods of demand plus the 2383 'phantom' units to force the backend to place a corrective order that covers the current stockout and upcoming demand, effectively 'canceling out' the lost units in the logic. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current volatility of the October demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/11/4. We are entering November, moving past the October demand regime which averaged ~300 units/period (P33-P38). The most recent demand was 276. P38 concluded with a small arrival (P35 order) but the large P34 order (1052 units) is still in transit (L=4 currently). Historical 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25) totals 2383 units and is still clogging the pipeline calculation. Total In-transit is 3315; effective pipeline is 3315 - 2383 = 932 units. The P34 order (1052 units) is the primary real expected arrival. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive phantom pipeline and stopping all ordering, I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat to ensure it targets a base stock that accounts for the 1-period delay and the upcoming winter demand. I'll set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period average of ~300. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, total confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains 2383 units. November demand is expected to align with the October average of ~300 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the system has no on-hand inventory and is facing a massive stockout. Demand has settled into a late-autumn regime, averaging ~270 units over the last 7 periods (P33-P39, excluding the P33 outlier). The 'In-transit' figure of 3315 is heavily inflated by 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25), which total 2383 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 932 units (Order P34 for 1052 units minus the P38 arrival of 280 units - wait, P34 hasn't arrived yet). P34 (1052 units) was ordered in Period 34 and is now 5 periods old (L=6 is approaching), suggesting it might also be delayed or lost. However, P35 arrived in 3 periods. To force the OR backend to place a corrective order despite the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to a value that exceeds the 'effective' pipeline + on-hand, while using 'default' lead time (2) to minimize holding cost risk once the supply chain stabilizes. I am forecasting demand at ~275 per period; for a (L+1=3) period window, mu_hat should be ~825, but I must inflate this to bypass the backend's 'phantom' inventory calculation.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 2383 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25). Recent demand (P34-P39) has stabilized at ~265 units/period for the late-autumn season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019-11-18. We are in a late-autumn demand regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P34-P40) has stabilized at an average of ~265 units/period, despite a spike in P33. Supply chain analysis: There is a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory. Total In-transit is 3884 units, but historically, orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, and now likely P34 (ordered P34, 1052 units, now L=6) are confirmed or highly suspected as lost/phantom shipments. Specifically, P34 is 4 periods past the promised lead time of 2. The total 'phantom' inventory is estimated at 2383 (previous) + 1052 (P34) = 3435 units. The effective pipeline is therefore 3884 - 3435 = 449 units (representing the P40 order of 569 minus some potential adjustments). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this inflated pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*265 = 3*265 = 795. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for volatility and potential demand shifts as we approach the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory increased to 3435 units with order P34 (1052 units) now confirmed lost (L=6). Recent late-autumn demand (P34-P40) is stable at ~265 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the system continues to struggle with phantom pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is 3884 units, but carry-over insights confirm that 3435 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, and now P34) are lost/missing. The effective pipeline is only 449 units (essentially the P40 order). Demand for these trainer socks has softened in late autumn, averaging ~242 units over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive phantom pipeline and refusing to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I need to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=2, I need to cover 3 periods of demand (~726 units). Since effective on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is ~569 (P40), I will set mu_hat high enough to trigger a replenishment that accounts for the phantom stock. By setting mu_hat to 4150, the backend calculates base_stock around 4150, subtracts the 3884 pipeline, and orders ~266 units, which aligns with one period of current demand. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to maintain a tight service level during this low-demand, high-uncertainty phase.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, total confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 3435 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34). Late-autumn demand regime (P37-P41) has softened further to ~242 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019 (Period 43). Recent demand (P37-P42) has been volatile due to stockouts but averages approximately 264 units/period, with a significant spike to 354 in P42, possibly indicating early holiday shopping for basic socks. The 'In-transit' quantity of 4203 is severely inflated by 3435 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34). The effective pipeline consists only of P40 (569 units) and P42 (319 units). Since on-hand is 0 and the next reliable arrival (P40) is expected in P43 or P44 (L=2 or 3), I must set mu_hat to cover the remaining winter demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current late-autumn/early-winter mean of ~263. I will use an explicit L of 2 to align with the promised lead time, as recent successful deliveries (P29, P35) arrived in 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 3435 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34). December demand is expected to remain around 265-300 units/period, though P42 showed a spike to 354 (+34% vs recent avg).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/09), the demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown significant volatility, dropping to 143 units in Period 43 from a spike of 354 in Period 42. However, moving deeper into December, we anticipate seasonal demand to remain moderate. The 'phantom' pipeline remains a major concern: we have identified 3435 units as confirmed lost (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34), meaning the reported 'In-transit' of 3634 units contains only 199 units of valid stock (from the P42 order of 319 units, adjusted for the fact that P40 has already arrived). Actually, calculating strictly: Total In-transit (3634) - Phantom (3435) = 199 units actually expected from P42. Current on-hand is 426. We use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the late-autumn/early-winter demand regime (Avg ~240). By setting L to 'explicit' at 3 (the most recent successful lead time from P40 and P35), we force the backend to cover 4 periods of demand. This will trigger a new order to ensure availability for the rest of December despite the phantom inventory inflating the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 3435 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34). Actual lead time for recent arrivals (P35, P40) has been consistently 3 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Demand has softened in December, with the last two periods averaging ~176 units, though the prior 10-period average was closer to 260. We are currently well-stocked with 536 units on-hand. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 3315 is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory. Specifically, orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, and P34 (totaling 3435 units) are confirmed lost as they are far beyond the observed lead time of 2-3 periods. This means the 'effective' pipeline is actually 0 (3315 - 3435 = -120, capped at 0). Since on-hand inventory (536) covers approximately 2-3 periods of current demand (~200/period) and recent actual lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent softening (last 5 periods avg ~230) to avoid over-ordering during the late-December lull, while allowing the OR engine to maintain a base stock that account for the 0 effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 3435 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34). Demand in Dec (P43-P44) has softened significantly to ~176 units/period compared to the autumn average of ~265.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The product is a 7-pack of cotton-blend trainer socks. We are in the late-December period, which historically shows a softening in demand for this specific SKU (trainer socks are less popular in mid-winter compared to spring/summer). Recent demand (P43-P45) has averaged ~194 units, significantly lower than the autumn average of ~265. The confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 3435 units (Orders P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34), which the OR engine would otherwise subtract from its base stock calculation. Total In-transit is 3315, which is almost entirely comprised of these lost orders. Effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 305, which covers roughly 1.5 periods of the current low-regime demand. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods. I will set L=3 to be safe given winter logistics. mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the current December slowdown (avg ~194), and sigma_hat is set to reflect the lower volatility of this softened demand regime.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P43-P45) confirmed softened at ~194 units/period (-27% vs autumn). Phantom pipeline inventory persists at 3435 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (late December/year-end). Current demand for this SKU (trainer socks) has softened significantly in December, with the last 4 periods (P43-P46) averaging ~202 units, down from the autumn average of ~265. On-hand inventory is 81 units. The 'In-transit' total is 3315, but based on carry-over insights, 3435 units are confirmed 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P15, P22, P23, P25, P34). This means the effective pipeline is zero. However, since the reported 'In-transit' (3315) is less than the 'phantom' total (3435), the backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will effectively see a negative pipeline or zero and likely trigger an order if base_stock > 0. Given the seasonal low and the transition to the new year, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (~202/period). This will set a conservative base stock to avoid overstocking during the post-holiday lull while still maintaining a service level for the 81 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime (P43-P46) confirmed softened at ~202 units/period, a ~24% decrease from the autumn average. Phantom pipeline inventory remains the primary driver of 'In-transit' data inflation.
