Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks). The prompt provides 5 periods of historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], averaging 266.4 units. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the promised lead time of 4 periods plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). The current date is February 11, which precedes the spring season where demand for 'trainer socks' typically increases as weather warms. Given we only have 5 historical data points, I will use all of them (recent_N=5) to estimate demand and volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and generate an order to cover the (4+1) period window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 310 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, these are correctly shown as 'In-transit'. Demand in Period 1 was 287, which went unmet as starting on-hand was 0. Historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272, 287] shows a mean of approximately 270. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent levels (avg ~277) while relying on the default promised lead time of 4. There is no evidence yet to suggest actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/2/25). The demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Socks' has significantly spiked in the last two periods (287 and 548) compared to the historical average of ~266. This suggests a seasonal demand shift or a regime change, potentially related to the time of year (late February). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 617 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders from Period 1 should arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Given the rapid increase in demand (100% increase from P1 to P2), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent upward trend. For sigma_hat, I'm also using 'recent_N' to account for the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (4) as we have not yet observed any completed deliveries to suggest a deviation from the promised schedule.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from historical avg ~266 to 417 across P1-P2 (+56%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Socks, and demand has surged significantly since Period 1, averaging 411.3 units/period over P1-P3 (287, 548, 399) compared to the historical seed avg of ~266. Inventory is currently zero because the promised lead time (L=4) means the first order placed in Period 1 won't arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (observable in Period 6). We have 1242 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). For Period 4 parameters, I maintain L=4 as we have no 'conclude' messages yet indicating a deviation from the promised timing. For mu_hat, I use N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg 411.3). For sigma_hat, I use N=3 to reflect the high volatility (std ~131) observed in this recent period, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to cover demand until the pipeline starts arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~266 to 411 (+54%) with significantly higher volatility (std ~131) over P1-P3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's trainer socks. Historical demand [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (avg ~266) has shifted significantly in the game history [287, 548, 399, 338], with a current game mean of 393 (+47%). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 1,869 units in transit because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 (310 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (this period), and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Since no orders have concluded yet, we maintain the 'default' lead time setting. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), we use the last 4 periods (the entire game history) to capture the higher demand regime and increased variance (std ~112) compared to the pre-game history. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5 confirmed: Game demand (P1-P4) mean is 393 vs pre-game 266 (+47%); Sigma increased from ~26 to ~112.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time L=4 is confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 of the order placed in Period 1 (4 periods). The next orders (placed in P2, P3, P4) are expected in P6, P7, and P8 respectively. Demand context: The first 4 periods of the game showed high demand (avg ~393), but Period 5's demand dropped to 252, which is closer to the pre-game historical average (266). This might indicate a reversion or high volatility. However, given the 'Socks & Tights' category, demand can be lumpy. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to reflect the game-state demand levels while accounting for the recent drop. Holding on-hand inventory is 58, and we have 1868 units in-transit, which is significant relative to the demand (avg ~365). The OR backend's cap should prevent over-ordering, but setting realistic parameters is key. I'll stick with recent_N=5 (all game periods) to capture the higher mean and variance seen during the simulation compared to the pre-history.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis: The product is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Current demand continues to fluctuate but generally remains higher than the pre-game average. Demand for the last 6 periods: [287, 548, 399, 338, 252, 329], mean ~359. The promised lead time is 4. Concluded arrivals from P1 and P2 both show a lead time of 4 periods (arriving in P5 and P6, respectively). The current pipeline is heavy (1679 units in-transit) following large orders in P3 and P4 to compensate for high demand and late arrivals. On-hand inventory is 36. Since shipments from P3 and P4 (totaling 1252 units) are expected to arrive in P7 and P8, I will maintain the promised lead time of 4 and use a recent_N window (N=6) of games-only demand to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Trainer Socks) is currently in Period 8 (April 1st). Analysis of the concluded periods confirms the promised lead time (L=4) is being honored consistently: P1 order arrived at P5, P2 at P6, and P3 at P7, all precisely 4 periods later. The demand history during the game (P1-P7) shows a significant shift compared to the pre-game history. Pre-game demand mean was ~266. In-game demand (P1-P7) has a mean of 366.9 with a standard deviation of 96.5. There was an initial spike (P2=548), but demand has since stabilized around the 330-415 range in recent periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher in-game demand regime and volatility while smoothing out early noise. With current on-hand inventory (246) and a large pipeline (1332), the system is well-positioned to meet demand as the large orders from P4-P7 begin to arrive. The OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline that covers L+1=5 periods of demand at this higher level (~1835 units total), which is currently satisfied by on-hand + in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliably confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand regime established at mean ~367 (+38% vs pre-game) with high volatility (std ~96) for the spring season.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing a basic sock SKU during the spring season. Historical analysis shows a clear lead time of 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand shifted from a pre-game average of ~266 to a significantly higher and more volatile regime starting in Period 1. The mean demand for the first 8 periods of active gameplay is approximately 368 with a standard deviation of ~92. The current inventory position (On-hand: 491, In-transit: 1147) is healthy, following the arrival of a large order from Period 4. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=8 to capture the entirety of the higher-demand spring regime while excluding the mismatched pre-game historical samples. Lead time will remain at 'default' (promised L=4) as it has been perfectly reliable.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the inventory status shows 478 units on-hand and 1216 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9 (all exactly 4 periods). Demand for this SKU (Womens Socks) has stabilised into a seasonal regime starting from the game's start (Period 1). Over the nine concluded periods, demand mean is 364 with a standard deviation of 86. The Carry-over insights successfully identified the demand shift early on, and the current performance shows that the system is meeting demand fully (no lost sales since inventory arrived). Given the stable lead time and the consistent but volatile demand pattern during the spring season, I will use the recent 9 periods (the entire available game history) to parameterise the OR backend. This provides a balance between responding to the early peak and the slightly lower recent demand (322 in P9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks', a seasonal product likely influenced by the spring season. Examining history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10). Demand in the game has shifted significantly from the pre-game mean of 266; since Period 1, the mean demand is approx 358.8 with a standard deviation of approx 85. Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P5-P10) has stabilized slightly with a mean of 334.8. Given the product type and spring dates, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher game-time demand context while smoothing out individual period fluctuations. This covers L+1 periods (5 periods). The lead time remains stable at L=4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which typically see steady or increasing demand as spring progresses into summer. Analyzing the game history (P1-P11), demand shows a higher regime than the pre-game history. The game mean is ~364 units/period, while the last 3 periods averaged ~379. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5 through P11). In-transit inventory (1382) plus On-hand (139) equals 1521 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (364 * 4 = 1456). We need to maintain a base stock that accounts for a 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). Since demand has been volatile (std ~90-100), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the full game regime. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect the higher volatility observed since Period 1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (May 6, 2019). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees stable to increasing demand as the weather warms towards summer. Demand in the last two periods (P11-P12) has risen to 427 and 438, significantly higher than the previous period average of ~330-380. The 4-period lead time remains stable and confirmed (P8 order arrived P12). Current on-hand (143) is low relative to the rising demand (~430/period). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=5 (P8-P12 demands: 382, 322, 308, 427, 438) to capture this recent uptick and higher volatility. Setting N=5 for sigma_hat will also reflect the increased variance observed in these recent swings. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4-period lead time is consistent with historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected in late April (Period 11-12): Mean demand increased to ~430 (+17% vs early spring average of ~367).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May). Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Socks' showed a spike in Periods 11-12 (~430 units) but dropped significantly in Period 13 to 267 units. This volatility is characteristic of the product category. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders (Periods 1 through 9). I am setting L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, the recent 3-period average is approx 377 units, while the full game average is approx 362 units. Given the high volatility (std ~84), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent seasonal trend while remaining responsive to the wide demand swings observed in the last three weeks. This helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against the high standard deviation without over-ordering based on the high demand peak in late April.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory review for Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees stable to increasing demand as the weather warms. Historical demand analysis shows a recent fluctuation: Period 11-12 averaged ~432 units, while Period 13-14 averaged ~271 units. Looking at the full history since Period 1 (excluding the extreme Period 2 outlier of 548), the mean demand for the 'game phase' is approximately 334 with a standard deviation of 63. The carry-over insight from Period 13 regarding a surge to 430 is currently contradicted by the last two weeks of lower demand (~271 samples), suggesting that the 'late April' surge was a temporary spike rather than a sustained regime shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P1 through P10. Therefore, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current volatility while grounding the forecast in recent performance (avg ~350). Setting L to default (4) and using recent_N for mu and sigma to allow the OR engine to react to this recent variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a 7-pack of trainer socks. Historical demand shows high volatility. The surge observed in late April (P11-P12) has cooled down, with the last three periods (P13-P15) averaging 297 units. However, looking at the broader 'game' average from P1-P15 (excluding pre-game data), the mean is approximately 356 units with a high standard deviation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline inventory (1298) plus on-hand (193) is 1491, which covers roughly 4.2 periods of mean demand\u2014slightly below the ideal safety level (L+1=5 periods). Given the transition into early summer and the nature of trainer socks, demand may fluctuate. I am using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent cooling of the late April peak, while using recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to maintain a wider safety buffer against the high volatility observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled following the late-April peak: mean demand for P13-P15 is ~297, compared to P11-P12 mean of ~432. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is trainer socks, which typically see sustained demand in spring and early summer. Period 16 concludes with lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P12 order arrived P16). Recent demand has stabilized after an April peak, with the last 4 periods (P13-P16) averaging 315 units/period (267, 275, 348, 370). While P11-P12 averaged ~430, the recent four-week window suggests a slightly lower but volatile mean. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current June regime (~315 * (1+4) = 1575) and use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility (std ~50.6). Promised Lead Time remains 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May/early June (P13-P16) at a mean of ~315 units/period, down from the late-April peak of ~430.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear, Socks & Tights) has stabilized into a late spring/early summer regime. Demand for the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) shows a mean of 311.4 (down from the late-April peak of 432.5). The most recent demand was 297. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 17 (P13 order arrived exactly on time). On-hand inventory is healthy at 432 units, and the pipeline (944 units) is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) at current demand levels. I will use recent_N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current stabilized demand regime (P13-P17), effectively ignoring the April spikes while maintaining enough sensitivity to the current seasonal trend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks' has stabilized following a late-April peak. In the most recent four periods (P15-P18), demand values were [348, 370, 297, 294], yielding a mean of 327.25. This is slightly higher than the P13-P16 average of 315 previously noted but remains significantly lower than the April peak of ~430. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P17 and P18). Inventory levels are healthy with 483 on-hand and 866 in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). To capture the stable but slightly fluctuating early-summer demand, I am using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat (covering P13-P18: avg 308.5) and N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility (std ~42 over this period compared to the earlier ~100+). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs from the previous higher-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in June: P13-P18 mean is ~309 (compared to the P11-P12 peak of ~432) with a significant reduction in volatility (standard deviation dropped from ~100 to ~40).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Fine-knit trainer socks) is a staple item with demand regimes showing seasonal shifts but relative stability in the short term. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P15 order arrived at P19). Demand for the last 7 periods (P13-P19) has averaged 306 units with a lower standard deviation (approx 36) compared to earlier spring months. Specifically, June demand (P17-P19) has been 297, 294, and 334 respectively. Using the last 7 periods (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will accurately reflect this stabilized, lower-volatility summer regime while providing sufficient smoothing. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and supported by the data.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (7p Basic Shaftless Socks) has entered the summer season. Evaluation of demand from Period 13 through Period 20 shows a clear stabilization in a lower range compared to the April peak. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 8 periods (P13-P20) is 309.25 units/period, with a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. This represents a significant reduction in volatility compared to earlier months. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 20. Given the consistent demand pattern over the past two months, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture this stabilized regime. The on-hand inventory (288) and in-transit units (1057) are being monitored; however, current calculations suggest we are entering July with a steady requirement, and the OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering if the pipeline is already saturated.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic trainer sock. Demand has stabilized into a very consistent regime throughout June and early July (Period 17-21). The mean demand over these last 5 periods is 306.2 units, and the standard deviation has significantly narrowed compared to the spring peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Currently, there is sufficient in-transit stock (1157 units) to cover demand during the lead-time window, and on-hand inventory is healthy at 142 units. To maintain this stability and optimize the base stock for the OR engine, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture the stabilized demand pattern observed since Period 13, which excludes the late-April demand spike. This helps balance the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1) while avoiding overstocking during this lower-volatility phase.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. Analysis of the demand regime for Period 13-22 shows a highly stable mean of approximately 309 units/period (total 3092 / 10 periods). The standard deviation has also decreased significantly compared to the spring peaks, currently sitting around 31 for this window. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. This stable summer regime for basic trainer socks justifies a 'recent_N' approach for demand and volatility parameters to capture the current lower volatility while ignoring the early-spring demand spikes. Specifically, an N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire stable June/July window (P13-P22). Parameters are set to ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this stabilized demand while managing on-hand inventory levels which are currently at 96 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a '7p Basic Shaftless' sock, a staple item. Currently, demand is stable in the mid-summer period (July). Reviewing the most recent demand regime (P19-P23), the mean demand is 321 units per period (334, 289, 317, 313, 352) with a standard deviation of approximately 24. This is a significant stabilization compared to the spring peaks and volatile shifts seen earlier. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P19 order in P23. On-hand inventory is low (16), but the pipeline is very healthy (1246 units), including the P20 order (347 units) expected to arrive in Period 24. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer demand pattern, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current mean of ~321 and low volatility, while 'default' lead time accurately reflects the 4-period promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in July (P19-P23): mean demand is 321 units/period with significantly lower volatility (std ~24) compared to previous periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks (372860001) has entered a stable regime in July (P19-P24). The mean demand over these most recent 6 periods is approximately 313 units, with a standard deviation of 26.3. This represents a stabilization compared to the high-volatility spikes seen in late spring. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, with orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20 all arriving exactly 4 periods after placement. For Period 25 (late July), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this current stable July demand profile. This sets \u03bc\u0302 based on (1+L) * 313.1 and \u03c3\u0302 based on sqrt(1+L) * 26.3, providing the OR backend with accurate parameters to maintain the target service level while minimizing holding costs as we transition out of the peak summer month.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/08/05). Analysis of the last 7 periods (P19-P25) shows demand has stabilized at a mean of ~305 units per period with a standard deviation of ~35. This represents a slight decline from the mid-July mean of ~321, suggesting a late-summer cooling. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P21 order arriving exactly in P25. On-hand inventory is 101, and in-transit inventory (orders from P22-P25) is 1264 units. Given L=4, the pipeline plus on-hand (1365 units) is intended to cover demand for periods 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 (L+1 periods). At the current mean of ~305, 5 periods of demand equals ~1525, indicating that current orders are slightly under-provisioned relative to the target base stock. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime while excluding the high-variance spring peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in late July/early August: Mean demand decreased to ~305 (P19-P25) from the mid-July mean of ~321 (-5%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $872.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a slight downward trend over the last three periods (P24-P26), with demand levels of 277, 256, and 258 respectively, following a stable July average of ~321. This suggests a late-summer cooling effect as the peak season begins to taper. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on history through P26. Although currently on-hand inventory is 160 units, there is a large pipeline (1173 units) with expected arrivals (P23 order of 311 units) scheduled for this period (P27), followed by P24, P25, and P26 orders arriving in subsequent weeks. Given the recent demand drop, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the transition from the July stability (avg 321) to the current lower demand regime (avg ~264 over the last 3 weeks). This balances the need for responsiveness with the volatility observed in earlier months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in August confirmed: demand dropped from July average of 321 to 264 over P24-P26 (-18%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks has shown a cooling trend as we transition out of the peak summer season. Historically, demand peaked in April/May (avg ~430) and July (avg ~321). In August (P24-P27), demand has moderated to an average of 273 (277, 256, 258, 301). Given the current carry-over insight suggesting a shift to ~264, the OR parameters should reflect this lower mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand 170 + in-transit 1068 = 1238) is already quite high relative to the expected demand of ~1365 units over 5 periods (273 * 5), a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 will capture the recent August decline while preventing excessive stock accumulation. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 4 periods to reflect the stabilized, lower volatility observed in the recent regime (std ~20 in August vs ~33 in July).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime in August (P24-P27) consolidated at a mean of ~273 units/period, down from the July average of 321, indicating end-of-summer seasonality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $940.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand for the '7p Basic Shaftless' trainer socks is showing a consistent end-of-summer softening. Over the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged approximately 277 units (277, 256, 258, 301, 294), which is significantly lower than the July average of ~321. The most recent demand (P28) was 294. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this late-August regime. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P20 through P24. Pipeline inventory is currently high (875), and with the current on-hand inventory (236), the total position is 1111 units. Given a lead time of 4, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~277, 5 periods of demand is ~1385. The backend will likely trigger a small order to bridge this gap, adjusted by the safety stock (z* sigma_hat) and constrained by the policy cap to avoid overstocking as we enter September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime in late August (P24-P28) stabilized at a mean of ~277 units/period, confirming the end-of-summer cooling trend (down 14% from July peak).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in an end-of-summer cooling phase. Following a July peak (avg ~321), demand in August (P24-P29) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 269 units/period (last 6 samples: 277, 256, 258, 301, 294, 229). The most recent period (P29) showed a further dip to 229. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 283 and a robust pipeline (910 units), the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs as demand enters the autumn transition. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this lower regime (approx 269 * 5 = 1345) and sigma_hat also on recent_N=6 to reflect the slightly increased volatility of 26 units during this shift. This will likely result in a smaller order or no order, as the pipeline relative to the new lower base stock is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September (start of autumn) confirmed cooling: P24-P29 mean is ~269 (-16% vs July peak), with recent volatility signaling a return to pre-summer levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in the September period. Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern: a peak in demand during April-July (approx. 320-430 units/period) followed by a definitive cooling trend starting in August. For the most recent period (P24-P30), demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) is approximately 270 units, with significantly lower volatility compared to the spring peak. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as evidenced by P26 arriving in P30). Given the transition into early autumn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this established lower-demand regime while maintaining safety stock for the minor fluctuations observed in recent weeks. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early autumn (September) has stabilized at a mean of ~270 units/period (P24-P30), confirming a ~16% drop from the July peak of ~321.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks (372860001) has transitioned into a stable autumn regime as of September. Analysis of recent demand (P24-P31) shows a consolidated mean of approximately 270 units per period, representing a seasonal cooling from the July peak of ~321. Specifically, the last four periods (P28-P31) show demands of 294, 229, 274, and 254 (mean = 262.75). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 187 and a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 955 units, the total available inventory covers roughly 4.2 periods of the current demand rate (~1142 units total). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this late summer/early autumn stability (P24-P31) while maintaining lean ordering to avoid excess holding costs, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in a stable early autumn regime. Since late August (P29), demand has consistently hovered between 229 and 274 units, with a mean over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) of 259.8 units. This confirms the previously noted cooling from the summer peak (July avg ~321). Lead time remains reliably 4 periods as seen in the conclusion of P32 (P28 order arrived). With on-hand inventory at 106 and in-transit at 1030 (which includes recent large orders from P29-P32), the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N of 9 (covering P24-P32) to capture the full post-summer distribution (mean ~266, std ~22) while ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation responds to the reduced volatility and lower average demand of the current season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September/Early October has stabilized further: P28-P32 mean is ~260, confirming a sustained pre-winter level with low volatility (std ~23).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, there was a significant demand spike to 405 units, which is a major deviation from the established September/October average of ~260. Given the product is 'Trainer socks' and the date is late September (2019/9/30), this could be a temporary fluctuation or a shift in the autumn regime. However, looking at the history (e.g., late April), large spikes can occur. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 12 units on-hand and 955 in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33), the pipeline is well-stocked for the promised 4-period lead time. I will maintain a recent_N approach for demand estimation to balance the recent spike with the previous stable window, while keeping lead time at the default promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 33 (405 units), deviating from the ~260 average of the previous 5 periods. Monitoring to see if this represents a new autumn peak or a one-off outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $864.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, demand was 312, which follows a spike of 405 in Period 33. This confirms a shift from the previous regime of ~260 to a higher plateau (avg ~358 over the last two periods). We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand), with a projected arrival of 273 in Period 35 (ordered P31). Total lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Given the stockout and the apparent autumn demand lift, I will increase mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent upward momentum (Avg P30-P34: 298.6; 1+L=5). I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the increased volatility (std ~64). These settings will help the OR backend recover from the stockout and adjust to the new demand level while maintaining the desired service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in late September/early October (Period 33-34): Mean demand increased from ~260 to ~358 (+37%) with significantly higher volatility (std ~65). Stockout occurred in Period 34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1057.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in late September/early October (starting Period 33). Demand jumped from a stable baseline of ~260 to an average of ~328 across P33-P35 (405, 312, 266). Period 34 resulted in a stockout due to this spike. While Period 35's demand (266) dropped back toward the previous baseline, the product (Fine-knit trainer socks) typically sees autumn/winter interest, and the volatility has increased significantly (std ~70 in the last 3 periods vs ~23 previously). Therefore, I'm setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize this new regime's mean (~328) and higher volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P27-31 orders all arrived in 4 periods). On-hand inventory is critically low (7 units), though the pipeline (1272 units) is robust. The parameters are set to rebuild the inventory safety buffer.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a high-demand regime that accelerated in late September (P33), likely due to autumn seasonality. While demand peaked at 405 in P33 and 312 in P34, the last two periods (P35-P36) have settled at a mean of ~253. However, given the earlier peak and the upcoming transition into November (colder weather), I am treating the current regime as spanning P33-P36. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 9 units on-hand and a stockout recently in P34, the priority is ensuring the base stock covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean (~306) and volatility (std ~73) observed since the late-September spike to prevent stockouts while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for October has stabilized higher than the September average: P33-P36 mean is ~306 units/period (+17% vs early September mean of ~260).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 is currently experiencing a demand surge associated with late October/early November (approaching winter seasonality for socks). A stockout occurred in Period 37 due to demand (306) exceeding available inventory (245). The demand regime for the most recent period block (P33-P37) shows a mean of approximately 306 units/period, which is a significant increase from the September average of ~260. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high total in-transit pipeline (1421 units), the priority is to maintain a base stock that accounts for this higher late-autumn demand (mean ~310, std ~60) while the pipeline catches up. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated October demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late October (P33-P37) stabilized at a mean of ~306 units/period (+17% vs September), leading to stockouts in P34 and P37. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $991.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (cotton blend trainer socks) is entering November. Historical patterns and the Carry-over Insights indicate a recent demand stabilization around 300 units/period (P33-P38 mean is ~301). Although there was a spike in Period 33 (405 units), the last two periods (P37 demand=306, P38 demand=276) suggest a slight cooling or stabilization rather than a major holiday surge yet. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through Period 38). With 113 on-hand and 1259 in-transit, the pipeline is substantial. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering P33-P38) to capture this stabilized autumn regime while maintaining the standard safety level through 'recent_N' for sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased volatility (std ~55 over the last 6 periods) compared to the very stable summer period, protecting against recent stockouts observed in P34 and P37.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-autumn (late Oct/early Nov) stabilized at ~300 units/period (P33-P38), down from the late September volatility but 15% higher than early September levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's cotton blend socks, a product subject to seasonal shifts as weather cools in November. Entering Period 40 (Nov 11), we are seeing stabilized mid-autumn demand. The demand regime over the last six periods (P34-P39) has stabilized at a mean of ~274 units/period, following the late September/early October volatility. Although there was a spike to 405 in P33 and stockouts in P34 and P37, the most recent three periods (P37-P39) show a consistent average of ~274. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this post-spike stabilization while maintaining enough buffer for the current seasonal level. Sigma_hat is set with N=6 to reflect the current moderate volatility (std ~24 over the recent stable window). Lead time is verified and stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for early November has stabilized at ~274 units/period (P34-P39), suggesting the late-October autumn peak has plateaued or slightly softened compared to the initial September spike.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (cotton-blend trainer socks) is currently in mid-November (Period 41). Analyzing recent historical demand (P34-P40), the mean is approximately 270 units per period, showing a slight cooling trend from the late-October peak. Volatility has also decreased significantly compared to the September/October spike. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on 'Period 40 conclude' (P36 order arrived). I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand stabilization observed since the late-October peak began to soften. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the current lower volatility. This approach balances the inventory against the established late-autumn demand level while maintaining a buffer for seasonal variance as we move closer to December.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-November (P34-P40) has stabilized at a mean of ~270 units/period with significantly reduced volatility (std ~24) compared to the September/October peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks has stabilized into a late-autumn pattern. The most recent demand (Period 41) was 210, following a series of demands in the 240-270 range. Over the last 8 periods (Period 34-41), the mean demand is 250.3 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 30. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 442 units on-hand and 756 units in-transit, current inventory levels are healthy. The goal is to set parameters that maintain a 4:1 service level (profit $4 vs holding $1). I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized mid-to-late November regime, ensuring the OR engine targets (~250 * 5) total inventory across the lead time plus current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late November (P34-P41) has averaged ~250 units/period, showing a slight softening from the early November average of ~270.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are in the early winter season. Recent demand in Period 42 spiked to 354, deviating from the mid-November average of ~250. This surge is likely driven by Cyber Monday/early December holiday shopping for socks (a common gift item). Given the lead time is 4 periods, orders placed now will arrive in late December (Period 47). I need to account for this seasonal increase while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is approximately 286 units. However, given the Dec 2nd date and the jump to 354 in P42, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend (~286 * 5 = 1430 for 5 periods) and recent_N with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased holiday volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 42 (354 units), likely related to early December/Cyber Monday shopping, breaking the mid-November cooling trend of ~250.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand in P42 surged to 354, likely due to Cyber Monday/early December shopping, but dropped significantly to 143 in P43. This high volatility is typical for the holiday season. The item is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which might see gifting demand or clearance interest in December. However, P43 (143 units) suggests a temporary lull or post-cyber-week drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (last observed arrival: P39 order arrived P43). Given the proximity to the end of the game (P47), we need to ensure enough stock covers the final 4 periods without excessive overstocking, as holding costs ($1) are relatively high compared to profit ($4). I will use a 5-period average (P39-P43) which includes both the spike (354) and the dip (143) to normalize the mean to ~241 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent volatility while adjusting for the approaching game end.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed: P42 spike (354) followed by P43 dip (143). Mean demand for start of December (P42-P43) is ~248 units/period, consistent with the late November cooling trend but with higher variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $578.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday period (P45, Dec 16). Demand has been volatile recently: a spike in P42 (354) followed by a dip in P43 (143) and a moderate P44 (209). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 233, while the late November peak averaging ~250. Given the proximity to Christmas, we must maintain safety stock to handle potential last-minute holiday shopping spikes, though historical trends suggest a slight cooling compared to October peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current holiday regime (approx 233 units/period) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in December. This results in a base stock level that protects against stockouts during the final two periods of the game.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), two days before Christmas. Historically, demand for socks often spikes in late December for the holidays and then drops in January. Recent demand (P43-P45: 143, 209, 231) shows a recovery from a post-Cyber Monday dip, averaging 194 units. However, looking at the lead time (L=4), orders placed now will arrive in Period 50 (late January), which is typically a low-demand post-holiday period. To avoid overstocking during the January lull while accounting for holiday volatility, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=5. This captures the November/December transition (averaging ~234 units) while allowing the OR engine to moderate base stocks as the holiday peak passes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $677.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the end of the holiday season and entering the post-holiday/New Year phase. Demand in the last two periods (P45-P46) has stabilized around 224-231 units, while the holiday spike in late November (P42, 354 units) and earlier November volatility has settled. The mean demand for the last five periods (P42-P46) is approximately 232 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 219 and 850 units in-transit (covering orders from P43-P46), we are well-positioned for January. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current post-holiday demand level (mean ~232) and volatility, which provides a safer base stock for the start of the year compared to the higher full-history or mid-autumn averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late December/end-of-year has stabilized at a mean of ~230 units/period (P44-P46), following the late November/early December holiday volatility.
