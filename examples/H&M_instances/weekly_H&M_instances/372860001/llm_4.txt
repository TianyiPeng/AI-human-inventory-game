Historical demand samples (231, 255, 302, 272, 272) suggest a baseline average of approximately 266 units per period. Today is February 11th. In many retail contexts, basic socks have relatively stable demand, though late winter/early spring transitions can see slight uplifts for 'trainer' (no-show) styles as people transition to spring footwear. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (5 periods) with the current inventory and this order. Current inventory is 0. Expected total demand for 5 periods is approximately 266 * 5 = 1330 units. To account for potential variance and the 4-period lead time, I will add a small safety stock Buffer.",

Currently, I have 1,400 units in transit and 0 on hand. Since the current Period 1 demand of 287 was lost (0 sold) due to zero inventory, the pipeline of 1,400 units is essentially designed to cover the 5-period window starting from its arrival (Periods 5-9).

However, looking at the in-transit schedule: Orders from P10 (230), P11 (350), P12 (450), and P13 (550) are pending.

  "rationale": "The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand in spring and summer. We are now in Period 28 (mid-August), entering the late-summer/early-autumn transition. Historical demand from the last four periods (P24-P27) shows a shift to a lower regime: 277, 256, 258, and 301 (Average: ~273). This confirms the 'post-peak summer decline' noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our decision for Period 28 must cover demand for 5 periods (P28 through P32 arrival resolution). Estimated demand for these 5 periods is ~1,365 units (systematic average of ~273/period). Current inventory position: 629 (on-hand) + 150 (in-transit) = 779 units. Expected arrivals: P28 (P24 order: 100), P29 (P25 order: 0), P30 (P26 order: 0), P31 (P27 order: 50). Total pipeline including scheduled arrivals is 779. To reach a safe inventory level of ~1,400 (roughly 5 periods of demand + a small safety buffer against variability), we need to order approximately 620 units. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0), and the fact that demand is trending downwards, I will move cautiously to avoid excess stock as we exit the peak season. I will order 500 units to bolster the pipeline for when current stock runs low in September.",

The pipeline consists of orders from P37 (250), P38 (275), P39 (175), and P40 (175), totaling 875 units in-transit. With a confirmed 4-period lead time, the P37 order of 250 units is expected to arrive during Period 41 (visible in P42). The total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 1079 units. This must cover demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current decision period (Total = 5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods at the current mean (265 * 5) is 1325 units. There is a gap of approximately 246 units. I will order 250 units to maintain a sufficient safety stock heading into the holiday season and end-of-year weeks, accounting for current lead-time stability.",

Given the game ends at Period 47, I only need to cover demand for periods P42 through P47. Assuming a conservative demand of ~230 units per period, total required stock is 1380 units.

Given the game ends at Period 47, we only need to cover (47 - 44 + 1) = 4 more periods of demand.
