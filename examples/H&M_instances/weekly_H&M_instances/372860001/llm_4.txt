Historical demand samples [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] suggest an average demand of approximately 266 units per period. The date is Feb 11, 2019; while Valentine's Day is approaching, socks are a stable category and unlikely to see a massive immediate spike, though they are a year-round necessity. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the rule (L+1) demand coverage, I need to cover Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand (266) * 3 periods = 798 units. To account for variability and prevent stockouts during the lead time, I will apply a small safety buffer, targeting approximately 850 units total.

Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3. Given P10 (ordered 4 periods ago) hasn't arrived, there is a high risk of stockout and potential order loss. To maintain a service level against a forecast of ~370-400 units and compensate for high pipeline uncertainty, a safety-stock-heavy order is necessary. Target pipeline (On-hand + In-transit - Lost) should cover at least 4 periods of demand (~1600 units). Current visible pipeline (excluding lost P4/P8) is 1812.

We need to cover demand for Period 26 (current) and the lead time horizon (P27, P28). With an expected demand of ~315 units/period, the total requirement for the (L+1) horizon is ~945 units. Current effective stock + pipeline (121 + 1250 = 1371) is sufficient to cover this. However, given the high loss rate (~50-60%), we must maintain a continuous ordering flow to hedge against future shipment disappearances. We order 300 units to replace expected consumption and maintain safety stock against the established pattern of shipment losses.",
