The date is 2019/2/11 (mid-February), which is post-winter and heading into spring, where demand for trainer socks typically remains stable or begins to rise as people wear low-cut shoes. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My ordering strategy must cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Total projected demand for the next 5 periods is approximately 1,330 units (266 * 5). Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I will order 1,330 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand and safety stock needs.",

  "rationale": "The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a year-round staple with moderate seasonal peaks. We are in mid-November (Period 41). Historically, October showed a demand spike (averaging ~300+ units, max 405), but November (P39-P40) has moderated back to a mean of ~247 units, aligning with late-summer levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, my current decision affects Period 45. On-hand is 331. In-transit pipeline: P37 order (250) arrives P41, P38 order (250) arrives P42, P39 order (300) arrives P43, P40 order (300) arrives P44. Total pipeline visibility (On-hand + P37-40 in-transit) = 331 + 1100 = 1431 units. Estimated demand for the next 5 periods (P41-P45) at a baseline of ~270/period is 1350 units. To maintain a safety buffer against potential pre-Christmas/Black Friday demand spikes in late November/December and to avoid the stockout issues seen in October, I will place an order. Expected On-hand + In-transit (1431) nearly covers 5 periods of demand (1350); an order of 250 units ensures we enter the holiday season (P45+) with sufficient stock.",

{
  "rationale": "The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a cotton-blend staple. Today is 2019-11-25 (Period 42), heading into the late November/December holiday shopping season (Black Friday through Christmas). Historically, demand for this SKU was highest in the first half of the year (mean ~340) and moderated to ~270-280 in late Summer/Autumn, with a brief spike in late September (Period 33). Recent demand (P38-P41) has been lower, averaging ~245, which aligns with the lower boundary of pre-game samples. However, calendar knowledge suggests a potential seasonal uptick for stocking stuffers/basics in December. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My total pipeline (On-hand: 371 + In-transit: 1100) is 1471 units. With 6 periods remain in the game (P42-P47), across a lead-time horizon of 5 periods (L+1), I need to cover demand until P47. Assuming a conservative mean demand of 260 per period, required stock is ~1300 units for the rest of the game. Since I already have 1471 units in the pipeline and only 1300 estimated units remaining in total game demand, I will place a small order of 100 to maintain a slight buffer for any holiday spikes while avoiding overstocking as the game ends at Period 47.",

Current On-hand is 267. In-transit arrivals expected: Period 43 (P39 order: 300), Period 44 (P40 order: 300), Period 45 (P41 order: 250), Period 46 (P42 order: 100). Total pipeline (On-hand 267 + In-transit 950) is 1217. With 5 periods remaining (P43-P47), I forecast demand to average approximately 360 units due to holiday shopping.

  "rationale": "We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season for 'Socks & Tights'. Historical demand shows a holiday surge (P42 demand was 354), though P43 saw a temporary dip (143), likely due to timing before the final Christmas rush. Given the 4-period lead time, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in Period 48 (after the game ends at P47). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur holding costs and contribute nothing to revenue or service levels. My goal is to maximize profit (Revenue minus Holding Costs). The current inventory pipeline is as follows: Period 44 On-hand is 424. Expected arrivals: P44: 300 (P40 order), P45: 250 (P41 order), P46: 100 (P42 order), P47: 500 (P43 order). Total available across the remaining 4 periods (P44-P47) is ~1574 units. With 4 periods remaining and an expected peak demand of ~350-400 units per week, 1574 units is more than sufficient to cover demand without stockouts. Ordering more now would only increase the ending inventory and the associated holding charges without any benefit.",
