Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for SKU 372860001 (Womens Socks). Current inventory is zero with zero in-transit. The demand history across the last 5 periods shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272], which averages 266.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 4. Given the product type (socks) and the dates (mid-February), demand is expected to be relatively stable with a slight potential for spring transition, though the recent history suggests consistency. With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover at least (L+1) = 5 periods of demand immediately. I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised 4 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the most recent pace while accounting for the current zero-stock position. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level sufficient to cover the lead time gap.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed our first order of 310 units, which is currently in-transit. The inventory on-hand at the start of Period 1 was 0, and with 287 demand, we were unable to fulfill any sales (sold=0), leading to 0 ending inventory. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks, a staple item. Looking at the demand history [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] plus Period 1's 287, we see a relatively stable demand regime with an average of approximately 270 units per period. The promised lead time is 4. Since we have no completed arrival cycles yet, I will use the default 'calculate' method for Lead Time and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent level. Our goal is to ensure base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~1350 units).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand data shows a steady range (231-302), but Period 2 demand spiked to 548. The product is basic trainer socks, and the dates (Feb) don't suggest a major seasonal event, though the jump to 548 might be an early spring/fitness trend or a promotion. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 617 units in-transit (ordered in P1 and P2). With a promised lead time of 4, no arrivals are expected until Period 5. However, demand is significantly higher than the initial historical mean of ~260. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand surge while acknowledging the previous levels. L remains 'default' (4), and sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for increased volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product (Womens Socks) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we started ordering in Period 1, the first shipment is not expected to arrive until the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 1242 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown significant volatility in the first three periods (287, 548, 399). Given the early stage of the game and the nature of basic socks, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting (N=3) to capture the initial higher-than-historical mean (avg ~411 vs historical ~266). I will maintain the default lead time (4) as no shipments have concluded yet to suggest a drift. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks, a basic item with steady year-round demand but likely increasing as we head into spring (March). Historical demand [287, 548, 399, 338] averages 393 units/period, significantly higher than the training data provided in the prompt (~266). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 1,869 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we just finished Period 4, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 6's start. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals so far is consistent with the L=4 promise. I will set L=default. To capture the higher current demand level (mean ~393) compared to pre-start levels, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand at the currently observed rate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees consistent demand. The first order (placed in P1) arrived in P5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows [231, 255, 302, 272, 272] (provided) and subsequent observation [287, 548, 399, 338, 252]. There was a significant spike in Period 2 (548) and Period 3 (399), but demand has since stabilized between 250-340. The current pipeline (In-transit: 1868) contains orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. With L=4, we expect the P2 order (~307 units) to arrive this period (P6). On-hand inventory is low (58). Given the volatility in the first 5 periods, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and standard deviation to capture the recent stabilization while acknowledging the earlier spike. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the mean and the observed variance to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Significant demand spike observed in P2-P3 (Feb 18 - Feb 25).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (March 25). The SKU is Women's Fine-knit trainer socks. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through the arrival of Period 1 and Period 2 orders (P5 and P6 conclude messages respectively). Historical demands for the last 5 periods are [548, 399, 338, 252, 329], suggesting a mean of approx 373. Note that the spike in P2-P3 (Feb 18-25) might have been related to late-winter promotions or stock-up behavior. Demand has since stabilized. The on-hand inventory is low (36), but significant in-transit stock (1679) is expected to arrive starting next period (Period 7 arrival resolution will be Period 3's order of 625). For parameters: L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is performing as promised. For mu_hat, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the stabilized demand post-spike, ensuring the OR backend calculates requirements based on the current 300-400 range rather than the inflated early spike. sigma_hat also uses recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized to a range of 250-400 units following the Feb spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (April 1). The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees consistent demand as spring begins. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline inventory is high (1414 units) due to large orders placed during the February demand spike. Current demand has settled into a regime averaging 333 units over the last 4 periods (P4-P7: 338, 252, 329, 415). Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (approx. 1630 units for the window) and sigma_hat helps handle the current variability while the backend capped policy prevents over-ordering while the large pipeline (1414 units) arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Feb-spike (P4-P7 avg: 333). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) has a promised lead time of 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1-P4 all arrived with L=4). Demand analysis: The initial spike in late February (P2-P3) has subsided. The last four periods (P5-P8) show demand of [252, 329, 415, 382], with a mean of 344.5. This represents a stable post-spike regime. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'Spring' demand level. The Lead Time (L) is stable at 4, so I will stick with the promised default to allow the backend to use the 4-period window. Pipeline inventory is currently 982 (orders from P5-P8), and on-hand is healthy at 491.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is entering the spring season where demand typically remains steady or slightly increases as weather warms. Historical data shows lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P9). Demand has transitioned from the volatile February spike into a more stable regime. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has averaged 340 units (252, 329, 415, 382, 322). Pipeline inventory is high (1057 units in-transit + 478 on-hand = 1535 total), covering roughly 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain L=4 (promised) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike demand stability while remaining responsive to the current 300-400 unit range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P5-P9 has stabilized with a mean of 340 and moderate variance, following the Feb spike. Lead time remains strictly at 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is basic cotton-blend trainer socks. Historically, demand spiked in late February (likely a specific seasonal event or promotion) reaching over 500, but has since stabilized in a range of ~300-400. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is 331.2 with a standard deviation of 48.6. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 288 and there are 1222 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). Given the stable lead time and the post-spike demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach. I'll set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand pattern (P6-P10) without being skewed by the outlier spike in P2. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) based on the current run rate.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Socks) is in a stable post-February demand regime. The average demand from Period 5 to Period 11 is approximately 350.2 units per period (samples: 252, 329, 415, 382, 322, 308, 427). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11 (all orders arrived exactly on their 4th period). Currently, on-hand inventory is 221, and there is a large pipeline of 1194 units. Specifically, orders from P8 (195), P9 (384), P10 (283), and P11 (332) are in transit. The arrival for Period 12 (ordered in P8) is expected to be 195 units. Given the stable demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the stable regime since P5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant mean (~350) and volatility while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time. No anomalies or lost shipments are detected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 5 (P5-P11 avg: 350). Lead time remains strictly consistent at 4 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime after an initial spike in February (Periods 2-3). Since Period 5, demand has averaged approximately 353 units per period (P5-P12 avg: 353.1). In Period 12, a demand of 438 units resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0), indicating that recent demand is trending toward the upper end of the historical range. Since we are entering May (Period 13, May 6th), trainer socks often see sustained interest as weather warms. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on all 8 arrived shipments. I will set L=4 using 'calculate' to lock in this stability. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the stable regime since P5) to focus on the current mean of ~353, which translates to a mu_hat of ~1765 for the (L+1) window. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early game noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P5 stabilized with an average of ~353 units per period. Stockout in P12 (demand 438) suggests current inventory levels were insufficient for recent demand volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear Socks) is currently in a stable demand regime after a late-February spike. Over the last 9 periods (P5-P13), the average demand is 348.8, which is higher than the long-term historical mean. In Period 12, there was a stockout when demand hit 438, indicating that our standard safety stock was insufficient for the upper end of the current demand variance. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from P5 through P13. To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current stable higher-demand regime (approx. 349 units/period). Lead time L remains 'default' (4 periods) as it is highly stable. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to ensure the safety stock (z* based on the service level calculation) captures the volatility that caused the P12 stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 5 has stabilized with a mean of ~349 units per period across 9 samples. Period 12 stockout confirmed that demand peaks can exceed 430 units, requiring more robust safety stock settings within the current regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is trainer socks, which exhibit stable demand in the late spring. The demand regime since Period 5 has been relatively consistent, with a mean of 341 units (P5-P14). Although Period 12 saw a spike (438), the last two periods (P13: 267, P14: 275) suggest a slight cooling or stabilization. Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 125 units, and a large pipeline is in place (1475 units), including orders from P11 to P14. Since the demand has stabilized post-spike, I will use a window of the last 10 samples (P5-P14) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the relevant post-volatility regime. This window balances the need to account for recent demand levels without overreacting to the P12 spike.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 5, following an early spike in February. Over the last 11 periods (P5-P15), the average demand is 342 units. The most recent demand (P15) was 348, aligning closely with this long-term average. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (109), but a large order from Period 12 (443 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 16 resolution), which will replenish stock. Given the stability of the current demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the statistics of this stable period (P5-P15). This provides a reliable mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) for the OR backend to calculate the base stock across the (L+1=5) period risk window.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Since Period 5, the demand has averaged approximately 351 units per period (P5-P16). The most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) show a similar average (331 units), confirming the regime is steady as we transition from spring to early summer (June). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 16 arrival (ordered P12, arrived P16). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture the stabilized mean since the initial February spike, and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 to ensure sufficient safety stock against the volatility observed in earlier periods (like the P12 stockout). These parameters will allow the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P5 to P16: average demand ~351 units/period. Lead time strictly remains 4 periods based on 12 consecutive arrivals.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10th (Period 18). Historical data confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as seen in the Period 17 conclusion of the P13 order). Since the initial demand spike in February (Periods 2-3), the demand has settled into a stable regime. Analysis of the demand from Period 5 through Period 17 (13 samples) shows an average demand of approximately 342 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 59 units. Period 17's demand was 297, continuing this pattern. There are no immediate calendar holidays or seasonal shifts for cotton-blend trainer socks expected in mid-June that would disrupt this regime. I will use the last 13 samples (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stability while maintaining adequate safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 12. Lead time remains 'default' (promised = 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $885.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '7p Basic Shaftless Socks' continues within a stable demand regime established since Period 5. The recent demand mean (P5-P18) is approximately 345 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P17: 297, P18: 294) are slightly below this average but well within the typical variation for this SKU. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 14 order arriving exactly as expected in Period 18. Given the stability of both demand and lead time since the early-game spike in February, I am using a recent_N window of 14 periods (n=14) to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation accurately. This window size (P5 onwards) provides enough data to buffer against occasional spikes like the one seen in Period 12 while maintaining responsiveness to the current mean. The inventory position (On-hand: 291 + In-transit: 1236 = 1527) is healthy, covering approximately 4.4 periods of average demand, which aligns with the total review+lead time of 5 periods (L+1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (fine-knit socks) has entered a stable regime since Period 5, following an initial spike in February (P2-P3). The average demand from Period 5 through Period 19 is approximately 338 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 58 units. The lead time has remained consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 19). As of Period 20, the current date (June 24) suggests stable summer demand. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the entire stable regime since Period 5. This provides the OR engine with the most representative mean and variance for the current state while ignoring the initial volatility of the first four periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Demand for this SKU (trainer socks) has entered a stable regime since Period 5 (March 11), with an average demand of approximately 338 units per period over the last 16 samples. While there was a stockout in Period 12 due to a demand spike (438 units), recent demand (P17-P20) has trended slightly lower, averaging 303.5 units. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods based on 16 consecutive successful arrivals. Given the seasonality of socks (high demand in spring/summer), I will maintain a recent_N calculation for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=16 to capture the stable regime post-February. This ensures the OR backend uses a localized mean and variance while covering the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Reviewing the history from Period 5 through Period 21 shows a highly stable demand regime following the initial February spike. Over these 17 periods, the average demand is approximately 338 units per period, with a standard deviation around 56 units. The lead time has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods since the first arrival (all 13 arrivals confirmed a 4-period lead time). Currently, the inventory position (On-hand: 311 + In-transit: 1152 = 1463) matches the expected demand for the (L+1) window (5 periods * ~338 = 1690). I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the stability of the current regime while excluding the noisy startup phase. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while maintaining the 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P5 to P21: mean ~338 units/period, standard deviation ~56. Lead time remains strictly consistent at 4 periods (13/13 observations).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear / Socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Since Period 5, demand has hovered around a mean of ~340 units per period. The most recent history (Periods 17-22) shows very low volatility (avg ~304, std ~20), which is slightly lower than the long-term regime average. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as exactly 4 periods across 18 observations (Periods 5 to 22), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is healthy with 274 on-hand and 1185 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (capturing the post-February stable regime starting at P5) to maintain a robust base stock level (1+L=5 periods of demand), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to better reflect the current lower volatility environment while maintaining a safety buffer based on recent variations.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) has remained in a stable regime since Period 5. Analysis of the last 19 periods (P5-P23) shows a mean demand of approximately 337.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 51.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by 19 consecutive arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 197 units with 1144 units in-transit (orders from P20, P21, P22, and P23). Given the critical service level q = 0.8 (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), the current base stock logic is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 to capture the stability of the current regime while excluding the initial high-volatility launch phase (P1-P4). L will remain at 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 matches observations perfectly.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Fine-knit trainer socks) continues to exhibit a stable demand regime and a reliable lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has consistently averaged around 338 units with a standard deviation of approximately 56. The most recent demand (P24: 277) is within the expected range. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on 20 consecutive arrivals (P1 through P20 orders) arriving exactly at P+4. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. I will utilize 'recent_N' for both demand parameters to capture the post-spike stability (P5-P24, N=20). The pipeline inventory is healthy (1236 units), and current on-hand (249) combined with upcoming arrivals should cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) continues to exhibit a highly stable demand regime. Since Period 5, the demand has hovered around a mean of 330-350 units. Recent performance (P21-P25) shows slightly lower demand (avg ~283), but the broader regime since P5 remains the most reliable anchor for forecasting. The lead time is exceptionally consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by 21 consecutive arrivals arriving exactly as promised. My on-hand inventory is 265 and in-transit is 1232 (covering the 4 periods of lead time). I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 to capture the stability since the initial Feb spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure window. No significant season-driven shifts are yet evident in the August transition, so maintaining the steady-state parameters is optimal.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) has remained relatively stable since Period 5, following an early spike in February. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is approximately 298.8 units, which is slightly lower than the long-term average since Period 5 (~320 units). The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across 22 consecutive observations. Currently, on-hand inventory is 316 units with 1163 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). Because the demand shows a slight downward drift in recent weeks (avg of last 5 periods is 291 vs last 10 periods 299), I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining enough safety stock for potential late-summer fluctuations. Lead time is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized at ~300 units/period over the last 10 sessions (P17-P26), slightly lower than the P5-P16 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $955.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 7p Basic Shaftless Socks has shown a slight downward shift over the last 11 periods (P17-P27), averaging approximately 299 units per period, compared to the previous long-term average of ~350 units. The most recent demand was 301. The lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods based on 23 consecutive observed arrivals. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this slightly lower demand regime (approx 300 * 5 = 1500) while maintaining standard safety stock via the default sigma_hat. The In-transit inventory of 1002 units plus On-hand of 249 units (total pipeline 1251) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand (1500), so the OR engine will trigger a replenishment order to cover the gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P27 has stabilized at a lower mean of ~300 units/period (compared to ~350 in P5-P16). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has entered a stable regime starting around Period 17, with a mean of approximately 300 units per period. The last 12 demands (P17-P28) average 298.6 units. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at 4 periods based on 23 consecutive observations. Currently, on-hand inventory is 376 units with 952 units in-transit (P25-P28 orders). I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable demand window (roughly 3 months of data), and the default (promised) lead time of 4. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods) while accounting for the recent reduction in demand volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the beginning of the year. Over the last 13 periods (P17-P29), the average demand is 292 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 36. This is consistent with the insights noted in Period 27 and 28. The lead time remains exceptionally stable at 4 periods, with 25 consecutive observations confirming this duration. Given the product (socks) and the current date (early September), we are entering a stable post-summer phase before any potential winter holiday spikes. I will use N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this more recent, slightly lower demand behavior while maintaining enough data for statistical stability. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the (L+1)=5 period risk horizon, adjusted for the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P29 is stable with mean ~292 and lower volatility (std ~36) compared to earlier regimes.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Socks) is in a stable late-summer/early-autumn demand regime. Reviewing the history since Period 17 (approaching 14 periods), the demand mean has shifted from ~350 units down to approximately 292 units (P17-P30 mean = 293.4). The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show an even tighter mean of 271.2 units, but to ensure safety against back-to-school or seasonal transitions in September, I will use a slightly larger window. Choosing N=14 for mu_hat captures the stable regime since June, providing a mean of ~293 per period. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrival messages). Sigma_hat will also use N=14 to reflect the lower volatility (std ~= 37) observed in this recent regime, ensuring we don't over-calculate safety stock based on the high-volatility February-April period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit socks (SKU 372860001) has transitioned from a high-mean regime (~350 units) to a stable, lower-demand regime starting around Period 17. Over the last 15 periods (P17-P31), the mean demand has hovered around 285 units per period. The inventory position is currently healthy with 200 units on-hand and 1066 in-transit (pipeline covering roughly 3.7 periods of demand). Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods (100% arrival rate on the promised date). I will set N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained lower-demand regime (P17-P31) while maintaining the default lead time. This will allow the OR engine to right-size the base stock for the current lower-velocity sales environment, reducing holding costs while maintaining a service level tied to the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime P17-P31: mean ~285 units/period, significantly lower than the P5-P16 average of ~350.

Daily Reward (R_t): $669.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 280 units per period. The last 16 periods (P17-P32) show a mean of 280.4, while the more recent 5-period window (P28-P32) shows an even lower mean of 259.8. Given the '7p Basic Shaftless' socks product description and the late September date (2019/09/23), there is no immediate indication of a seasonal spike, so I will prioritize the recent stable regime. I am setting N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume period (P17-P32) while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations (std ~36). In-transit inventory (937 units) plus current on-hand (323 units) totals 1260 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the 280-unit rate. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we are well-positioned, but must continue ordering to maintain the pipeline. Lead time remains exceptionally stable at 4 periods based on 28 consecutive successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P17-P32 confirmed stable at a mean of ~280 units/period, significantly lower (approx -20%) than the P5-P16 average of ~350.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 285 units per period. Period 33 observed a spike to 405 units, which is significantly above the recent average but within the range of observed historical volatility for this SKU. Lead time remains strictly consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by 29 observations. Carrying-over the insight that demand shifted downward from the ~350 range to the ~285 range starting in June (Period 17). I will use recent_N=17 (P17-P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume regime while accounting for the recent spike in Period 33. The backend should use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers (4+1) periods of demand at a ~80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime that began around Period 17. The recent demand mean (P17-P34) is approximately 291 units/period with a standard deviation of 45. While there was a spike to 405 in Period 33, the following demand of 312 in Period 34 suggests this was transient. The lead time has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods for 30 consecutive observations. With on-hand inventory at 36 and 1108 units in-transit, there is a large pipeline. However, looking at the arrival schedule: Period 35 will receive the order from P31 (265 units), Period 36 receives P32 (242), Period 37 receives P33 (236), and Period 38 receives P34 (365). Given L=4, my decision for P35 must cover demand for P35 through P39 (L+1 periods). Using recent_N=18 (P17-P34) accurately captures this stable autumn regime. This balances the risk of stockout (as seen in P33) against the holding cost, especially given the current low on-hand stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 283 units per period. Recently (P33-P35), demand has seen a slight uptick (avg ~327), but it remains within the expected variance for this seasonal window (October socks demand). On-hand inventory is low (35 units) because we are between major arrivals, but the pipeline (1207 units) is healthy. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals from P1 through P31 (all arriving exactly at L=4). I will continue using the recent stable regime (N=19, from P17 to P35) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the shift that occurred in June and maintains stability through the current date.

Daily Reward (R_t): $923.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a slight upward shift or increased volatility starting around Period 33 (demands: 405, 312, 266, 240). While the Carry-Over Insights from Period 33 noted a lower stable mean of ~280, the average of the last 4 periods is ~305. The current date is October 21, entering the late autumn/winter season, which typically sees higher demand for 'Fine-knit trainer socks in a soft cotton blend' compared to the summer months. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36). I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P30-P36) to capture the current demand level (mean ~277) while maintaining safety stock against the localized peaks seen recently. This addresses the low on-hand inventory (37 units) while relying on a significant in-transit pipeline (1267 units) to meet the service level targets.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1092.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Women's trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Period 37 ended with a stockout (demand 306, on-hand 273), indicating that current on-hand levels are insufficient despite a healthy pipeline. This confirms the need to maintain a robust safety stock, as demand occasionally spikes above the 280-300 mean (as seen in P33 and P37). The current date is late October, moving into a potential seasonal period for socks, though history doesn't yet show a massive surge. I will continue using the recent stable regime (P17-P37) to calculate demand parameters. The lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods (validated by 33 consecutive successful arrivals). To recover from the current stockout and prevent future ones, I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand behavior while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the 1-period review cycle (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed stockout (demand 306 vs 273 available). Recent demand regime (P17-P37) maintains a mean of ~282 units/period with occasional spikes >300. Lead time remains strictly at 4 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860001' (Womens Nightwear Socks) is currently in a stable demand regime. Analyzing the data since Period 17, the mean demand is approximately 283 units per period. Recently (P34-P38), there has been a slight variability with demand ranging between 240 and 312, including a stockout in P37. The lead time remains exceptionally consistent at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the P38 arrival of the P34 order). My strategy for P39 is to use a recent window (N=15) to capture the current mean and variance accurately, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower demand compared to the early-year peaks while providing sufficient safety stock to prevent a repeat of the P37 stockout. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15, which covers the current stable regime from P24 onwards.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) follows a stable demand regime since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 283 units per period. The lead time remains exceptionally consistent at 4 periods. Recently, there was a stockout in Period 37 due to a brief demand spike (306 units) coinciding with lower on-hand inventory. However, subsequent arrivals in Periods 38 (365 units) and 39 (364 units) have restored on-hand inventory to 212 units. Given the transition into mid-November, we remain in a stable period for this basic sock item, though we should monitor for potential holiday interest. I will use a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat (P17-P39) to prioritize this lower demand regime (~283/period) over the high-demand spring regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N of 10 to capture recent volatility and maintain sufficient safety stock to prevent a repeat of the P37 stockout.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a stable demand regime within the 'Socks & Tights' category. Since Period 17, the demand mean has stabilized to approximately 280-290 units per period, a decrease from the earlier high of ~350 observed in the spring. Period 40 concluded with an arrival of 302 units (ordered Period 36), confirming the lead time remains strictly 4 periods. With the current date being November 18, we should monitor for potential holiday-related demand shifts, although trainer socks are less prone to extreme winter spikes than thermal wear. For Period 41, I will continue using a recent_N strategy for both demand and volatility to capture the stabilization observed since P17. N=20 is chosen for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the post-June stabilization (P17-P40) while discounting the significantly higher early-year volume. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods throughout the entire history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization since Period 17: mean ~285 units/period (20% lower than spring average). Lead time remains perfectly stable at 4 periods through 36 observations.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 7p Basic Shaftless socks has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since approximately Period 17 (June). Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is ~275 units/period (std ~51), which is consistent with the 'Period 41' carry-over insight of ~285 units/period for the broader autumn window. Lead time is perfectly consistent at 4 periods across 37 observations. We are currently in late November (P42: 2019/11/25). Historically, there was a significant demand spike in February (P2-P3), but for the immediate weeks, demand is expected to remain stable. My objective is to maintain a service level that prevents the stockouts seen in P37, while acknowledging the lower average demand compared to the spring/summer peak. I will use a recent_N of 25 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current stable regime (starting P17) while excluding the early-year volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' given its high stability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P43 (Dec 2, 2019). We are entering the winter season for 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Historically, demand stabilized around ~285 units/period starting at P17. However, recent data shows a slight uptick (P42 demand was 354), and the product category (Socks & Tights) typically sees higher demand during the December holiday season. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 201, and in-transit is 944. Total pipeline (1145) covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. To account for potential December seasonality while maintaining efficiency, I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the stabilized regime while allowing the most recent higher demand to influence the mean slightly. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable at 4.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks is currently in a stable regime that began around Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 43, the mean demand is approximately 280 units/period. However, the most recent four periods (P40-P43) have shown significant fluctuations (252, 210, 354, 143), likely influenced by typical end-of-year seasonal shopping patterns (late November/early December). Despite these fluctuations, the long-term mean remains the most reliable predictor. Lead time is exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by every single arrival in the history. To handle the inventory for the final few periods of the simulation (ending Period 47), I will use the established stable regime mean (N=27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 1+4 period window with appropriate safety stock to mitigate recent volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860001 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in Period 45 (Dec 16). Historical demand analysis shows a significant and sustained downward shift in demand that began around Period 17 (June). While the Period 5-16 average was ~350, the demand from Period 17 to the present (Period 44) has averaged approximately 283 units/period. Most recently, the last 10 periods (P35-P44) have shown even lower demand, averaging ~243 units/period, likely reflecting seasonal cooling for trainer socks during winter months. The lead time remains perfectly stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this more recent seasonal decline and adjust inventory levels downward. This avoids overstocking during a period of lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (e.g., P42 demand spike to 354 and P37 spike to 306). Providing parameters that reflect this lower 'winter' regime will optimize the balance between service level and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand decline confirmed: Period 35-44 average demand is ~243 units/period, down from the P17-P34 average of ~295. This likely reflects winter seasonality for trainer socks.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in a confirmed seasonal decline for '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', which is expected as this is a low-cut/trainer sock product entering the peak of winter. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P35-P45) is ~243 units/period, compared to the previously higher spring/summer regimes (~285-350). The most recent demand (P45) was 231 units, following on-hand levels that have grown to 352 units. Pipeline inventory is currently high (774 units) relative to the declining demand. Lead time remains perfectly stable at 4 periods (observed in all 41 arrivals to date). To avoid overstocking during this low-demand winter phase, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the winter mean of ~243, covering the (L+1)=5 periods of risk. This will result in a lower base stock, allowing the high pipeline and on-hand inventory to be consumed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are managing '7p Basic Shaftless Trainer Socks', a product that has shown clear seasonal shifts. As noted in the Period 45 Carry-over Insight, we have entered a lower demand regime for the winter season. The average demand from Period 35 to 46 (the last 12 periods) is approximately 242 units per period, consistently lower than the previous summer average of ~295. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P43-P46) have shown a mean of 202 units, suggesting either a stabilization or a slight further dip during the deep winter weeks. Lead time remains perfectly stable at 4 periods (observed in every shipment since P5). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the seasonal decrease while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat will also be set using the last 12 periods to reflect current volatility. L will remain at 'calculate' as it is highly stable.
