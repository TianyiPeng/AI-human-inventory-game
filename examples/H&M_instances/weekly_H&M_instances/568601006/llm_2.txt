Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With P14 arrival (200), total stock for the immediate future will be ~534. Expected demand over the next 5 periods (Lead Time + current period) at the new regime (~160/period) is 800 units. Current on-hand (334) + In-transit (300) = 634 units.

World knowledge of retail suggests that after the autumn peak (which we've been in since late August), demand for standard blazers often softens as winter wear takes over, before potentially a small holiday surge or clearance activity. Recent demand history shows a high-volume autumn regime: P34-P37 averaged ~298 units, but P39 showed a drop to 231. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 1,140 units and 0 in-transit, we have enough stock to cover approximately 4 to 5 periods of demand at current rates (~230-280 units/period). Given we are at Period 40 and the game ends at 47, any order placed now (P40) would arrive in P44, leaving only 4 periods of sales (P44-P47) to clear it. Maintaining high stock into the final periods carries high holding cost risk ($1/unit). Since our current 1,140 units already covers most of the remaining 8 periods (40-47), assuming a conservative demand of ~150-200 for late November/December, we are sufficiently stocked. No new order is needed this period to avoid excessive holding costs at game end.",

  "rationale": "The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn/winter tailoring season. Historical analysis shows demand peaked significantly in September/October (P30-P34), with recent demand (P38-P40) averaging approximately 298 units per period. As we move into mid-to-late November (P41, Date: 2019/11/18), and with the game concluding at P47, we must prepare for the eventual seasonal decline while accounting for the 4-period lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 862 units with 0 units in-transit. Based on the 3-period average of ~300 units, the current stock covers nearly 3 periods of demand. Given that any order placed today (P41) would arrive in P45, it would only serve the final three periods of the game (P45, P46, P47). Total expected demand for the remaining 7 periods (P41-P47) at a 300-unit rate is 2,100 units. However, demand typically tapers off as winter sets in for this product category. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the risk of being stuck with excess inventory at the end of the simulation, I am opting for a conservative order to supplement the existing stock and ensure coverage through the lead-time gap without creating a massive surplus.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a tailoring item subject to seasonal peaks. We are currently in Period 42 (late November). Historical patterns show a spring peak and a much stronger autumn peak that began in mid-August (Period 27). Recent demand (Periods 35-41) has averaged approximately 280 units per period, showing a gradual deceleration from the October peak (which reached up to 385 units). Given the date (Nov 25), demand is expected to continue cooling as we move into December and the end of the game (Period 47). Currently, there are 617 units on-hand and 400 units in-transit (ordered P41, arriving P45). Total pipeline inventory is 1017 units. With 6 periods remaining in the simulation (P42-P47) and an expected demand average of ~250 units moving towards ~200, the 1017 units are nearly sufficient to cover the entire remaining duration (estimated total remaining demand: 1300-1400 units). However, a small buffer is needed to ensure no stockouts during the final arrival window. Placing an order of 300 units now (arriving P46) will bridge the gap. No further orders will likely be needed after this to avoid excess holding costs at the game's end.",

Analysis of Period 42 showed a massive demand spike (733 units) for Black Friday, which depleted all on-hand inventory. Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 169 units, following the expected post-holiday lull. Historically, tailoring demand remains moderate in December before picking up for the new year. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 1200 units (ordered in Periods 41, 42, and 43), with 400 units from P41 expected to arrive in Period 45 (L=4). Therefore, Period 44 will likely face a stockout since no arrivals are due this period and on-hand is zero. To manage the pipeline for the remaining periods (45-47), the total requirement for the lead-time plus one period (5 periods total) at an estimated average demand of ~200-250 (accounting for post-holiday stabilization) suggests a need for ~1000-1250 units.

Historical analysis shows that the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) has demand driven by professional workwear peaks (spring/autumn) and retail events like Black Friday. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 42 (Black Friday week) and subsequent periods exceeded local supply. Pipeline analysis: The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 41 (400 units), Period 42 (300 units), Period 43 (500 units), and Period 44 (200 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, 400 units are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of the current period (P45), making them available for sale in P45, with P41's arrival being confirmed at the start of P46. Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday; while P43 was low (169), P44 rebounded to 304. Given that we are approaching the end of the 47-period horizon, we must avoid over-ordering to prevent high holding costs on units that won't sell before the end. Current Pipeline: 1400 units. Remaining periods: 3 (P45, P46, P47). Estimated demand for remaining 3 periods: ~750-900 units (~250-300 per period).

Historically, after the November/December peak, demand for tailoring typically softens during the mid-winter transition (January) before the spring tailoring season begins in February. Recent demand shows a significant drop from 304 (P44) and 258 (P45) to 128 (P46), which reflects the end-of-year slowing. With a 4-period lead time, orders placed now will arrive in P51 (early February), aligning with the start of the spring peak observed at the beginning of the history (P1-P5 demand averaged ~230). Current inventory position: On-hand (314) + In-transit (500 from P43, 200 from P44) = 1,014 units. Expected arrivals: P47 (500 units), P48 (200 units). At an estimated transition demand of ~150-200 units/period, the 1,014 units cover approximately 5-6 periods.
