In mid-February (Date: 2019/2/11), demand is typically transitioning into the Spring office/occasion wear season. b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples are [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging 173.4 units per period. The standard deviation is relatively stable (~19.5). c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 arrives in P3 (visible at P4 start). d) Inventory Assessment: Current On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. This is the first period. e) Final Order Logic: I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods (P1, P2, P3). Total required stock = 173.4 * 3 = 520.2. Adding a safety stock buffer to reach a ~95% service level (1.645 * 19.5 * sqrt(3) \u2248 56 units) gives a target pipeline of ~576 units. I will order 576 units to establish immediate stock and cover the pipeline until the first arrival.",

  "rationale": "a) Product Analysis: The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's tailored garment. The date is Feb 18, 2019. Historically, demand for blazers and tailoring tends to rise in early spring as customers update workwear and transition out of heavy winter coats. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples (avg ~173) suggested a base level, but the first observed demand (Period 1) was 227, which is significantly higher (+31%) than the historical mean. This suggests either a higher baseline or early seasonal demand. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in P1 (576 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Currently, we are at 0 on-hand due to lead time lag, resulting in lost sales in P1. d) Inventory & Pipeline: In-transit is 576. We need to cover demand for the lead time (2 periods) plus the current period's demand (L+1 = 3 periods). e) Order Logic: With an expected demand of ~230 units per period, 3 periods of demand is ~690 units. We have 576 in-transit. To reach a safe stock level that accounts for the higher observed demand and potential variability, I will order enough to bring total pipeline (inventory + in-transit) to approximately 850 units (covering ~3.7 periods of demand at the 230 rate) to build a safety buffer and mitigate the stockout impact from the initial delay.",

Based on lead time history (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), P10 (ordered 5 periods ago) is now significantly overdue and likely lost, similar to earlier shipments. P11 (ordered 4 periods ago) is also overdue. Given the high unreliability of the supplier (approx. 70% loss rate) and the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($4.00), carrying excessive inventory is risky.

This confirms the transition predicted in previous periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline is extremely unreliable: historical data shows P1, P2, P6, P10, P11, and P17 are almost certainly lost (2050 units total). Excluding these, the active pipeline consists of P23 (100 units - 4 periods overdue), P24 (150 units - 3 periods overdue), P26 (250 units), and P27 (250 units). Given that P25 arrived in 2 periods, P23 and P24 are likely lost. The effective active pipeline is only 500 units (P26, P27). To meet the new demand regime of ~250-300 units/period and account for high lead-time volatility/loss rates, a significant order is required to build a safety buffer for the autumn peak.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal garment with high demand during the autumn/winter transition. We are currently in mid-November (Period 41). Recent demand (P38-P40) has averaged 298 units, reflecting a slightly cooling but still robust late-autumn regime. Supplier reliability remains extremely volatile. Analyzing the pipeline: P35 (650 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost; P38 (450 units) is 3 periods overdue and highly likely lost; P39 (400 units) is 2 periods overdue; P40 (350 units) is 1 period overdue. Given the '1 to 3 period' successful delivery window observed in the history, P39 and P40 are the only viable in-transit units. My goal is to maintain a safety stock that covers 2-3 periods of demand (~900 units) because of the frequent shipment losses. Current on-hand is 443. With expected demand of ~300 for the next period, I need to order enough to replenish the pipeline and protect against the high loss rate. I will order 450 units to target an inventory position that accounts for the likely loss of older orders while covering late-season demand.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 41: Cumulative lost shipments increased to ~5,450 units as the Period 38 order (450 units) is now 3 periods overdue and follows the loss pattern of P35. Current demand regime for the blazer remains stable at ~300 units per period in late November.",

We are now in late November (P42), moving towards the end of the game (P47). Supplier reliability remains volatile with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and significant historical losses (~5,450 units total). Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 1,048 units following the arrival of orders from P38 and P39. The active pipeline (orders less than 4 periods old) includes P40 (350) and P41 (450), totaling 800 units. Total inventory + reliable pipeline is 1,848 units. Given an average demand of ~285 units/period, we have approximately 6.5 periods of stock, which covers the remaining game duration (P42-P47). However, because of the high loss rate, a small maintenance order is prudent to hedge against further delivery failures while being mindful of the $1.0 holding cost. I will order 150 units to keep the pipeline moving without risking excessive overstock at the end of the game.",

The Period 40 order (350 units) is now 2 periods overdue and, based on the historical pattern of roughly 50% shipment loss, is considered at high risk of being lost. However, the Period 41 order arrived in just 1 period. Demand is expected to remain elevated through the holiday season (early December). Given the volatility of supplier reliability (cumulative lost units ~5,450), I must maintain a safety stock to handle both demand surges and potential shipment failures.

Demand surged significantly in late November (P42, 733 units) due to holiday/Black Friday events, but dropped to 169 in the most recent period (P43). Based on typical retail patterns, we expect a second, smaller surge in mid-December for holiday parties and gifts, followed by a post-Christmas slump. The current demand regime is estimated at 300-350 units/period, excluding outlier spikes. Lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high loss rate (~70%+ of historical units lost). On-hand inventory is 596. In-transit consists of P40 (350), P42 (150), and P43 (400). Following the loss pattern, P40 (ordered 4 periods ago) is highly likely lost. P42 and P43 are the active pipeline (550 units). To cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (total 47) and handle potential lead time delays, I need to ensure the pipeline + on-hand covers expected demand of ~300-400 per period.

The product is a fitted blazer, which typically sees strong demand in autumn/winter but may experience a slight pre-holiday dip or stabilization after the late November/early December peak (733 units in P42). Recent demand has normalized around 170-300 units. Our on-hand inventory is 442 units. Looking at the pipeline, the P40 order (350 units) is 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. The P43 (400) and P44 (400) orders are the only relevant active shipments. Given the actual lead time varies between 1-3 periods, P43 is expected to arrive in P45 or P46. With 442 units on hand and only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, 47), and a projected demand of ~300 per period, we need roughly 900 units total to finish. On-hand (442) + P43 (400) covers most of this.

With a remaining inventory of 184 units and the P43 order (400 units) expected to arrive this period (P43 + 2-3 periods lead time), the immediate stock risk is low. However, looking at the pipeline, out of the 4,600 units in-transit, approximately 6,150 units are historically confirmed lost (P1-P40 excluding successful arrivals), meaning the 'active' pipeline is much smaller (P43, P44, P45 total 1,050 units). Given that the game ends at Period 47, only the current period (P46) and the final period (P47) require stock. Total expected demand for P46 and P47 is ~600 units (300 per period). Current inventory (184) plus expected P43 arrival (400) should cover the remaining lifespan of the game.

On-hand inventory is currently 856 units, which is significantly more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period (estimated between 100-200 units). Given that this is the final decision period and the goal is to maximize total reward (Profit x units_sold - HoldingCost x ending_inventory), any additional units ordered would not arrive in time to be sold (actual lead time is 1-3 periods) and would only incur unnecessary holding costs if they did arrive or would not contribute to profit.
