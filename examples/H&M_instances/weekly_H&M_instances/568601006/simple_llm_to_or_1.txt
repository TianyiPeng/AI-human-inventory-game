SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last 5 periods (training data) shows a range between 145 and 196, with a mean of approximately 173. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is 2019/2/11. This is mid-February, which marks the start of the spring season for retail. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this product is highly relevant for the 'back-to-office' or 'spring transition' period. Demand is expected to remain stable or slightly increase as customers update their professional wardrobes. 3. Trend Analysis: The recent demand sequence [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows a generally upward trend compared to the first two points, stabilizing in the 180-190 range. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the seasonal shift towards spring tailoring and the recent stability in the high 180s, I predict a slight continuation of this momentum, forecasting demand at 190.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data shows a mean of 173.4 units (range 145-196). Period 1 observed demand (227) represents a significant increase (+31% vs mean). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is 2019/2/18. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this product enters peak relevance during the spring transition and the start of the work/occasion season in February/March. 3. Trend Analysis: There is a clear upward trend from the training data (ending at 186) into the first test period (227), suggesting a demand 'ramp-up' phase. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the momentum into the spring season and the jump in Period 1, I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly increase as the spring shopping season intensifies. I will forecast a slight increase from the Period 1 actuals to capture this seasonal momentum.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The initial training data showed a relatively stable mean around 173 units (161, 145, 179, 196, 186). 2. Recent Trends: Since the start of the test phase (Period 1), there has been a significant and sharp upward movement. Period 1 recorded 227 units and Period 2 recorded 284 units, indicating strong positive momentum. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is late February (2019/2/25). This aligns with the transition into the Spring season for women's tailoring (Blazers), where demand typically increases as customers refresh their professional and 'dressed' wardrobes for warmer weather and the start of the new work/social season. 4. Final Logic: Given the 25% increase from Period 1 to Period 2 and the seasonal relevance of the product category, I expect the upward trend to continue, though perhaps at a slightly moderated pace as it stabilizes at a new level.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Analysis: The training data (161-186) showed a steady baseline. In the test phase, Period 1 (227) and Period 2 (284) showed a significant jump, followed by a correction in Period 3 (198). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. This is the start of the Spring season in the Northern Hemisphere. For 'Womens Tailoring' and blazers, this typically marks the beginning of high seasonal demand as consumers refresh workwear and formal attire for spring. 3. Trend: The average of the three test periods is 236, which is notably higher than the training average (~173). The drop from 284 to 198 suggests a peak occurred in late February, but demand remains elevated compared to the initial training baseline. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the transition into March and the 'Dressed' product category, I expect demand to stabilize around the current mean or slightly increase as spring shopping accelerates. I forecast 215, representing a slight recovery from the Period 3 dip while respecting the higher baseline established in the test phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (Feb 11): mean demand increased from ~173 to ~236 (+36%) coinciding with Spring product launch/seasonality.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an average demand of 173 units. Since Period 1 (mid-February), there has been a significant shift in demand coinciding with the Spring/Spring-Summer transition for women's tailoring (Blazers). The observed demand for the first four periods of this new regime is 227, 284, 198, and 214, resulting in a mean of 230.75 units. This represents a ~33% increase over the training baseline. The current date (March 11) is deep into the spring shopping season. While Period 2 saw a peak (284), the subsequent two periods have stabilized around the 200-215 range. Forecast logic weights the most recent stability (Period 3-4) alongside the established seasonal mean of ~230.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. Since Period 1 (mid-February), a demand regime shift occurred, with the test phase average rising to 228 units. Recent demand has stabilized significantly: Period 4 (214) and Period 5 (215) show almost no variance. As we are in mid-March, demand for 'Womens Tailoring' like the Mariette Blazer remains high due to Spring workwear trends. Given the recent flat trend (214 to 215), I forecast a slight increase to 220, reflecting continued seasonal relevance while acknowledging the current stable baseline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (a women's tailoring piece) shows a baseline average of 173 in the training data, which shifted to a higher regime (~225) starting in Period 1 (Feb 11), likely due to the Spring fashion season. Recent demand from Period 4 through Period 6 has stabilized remarkably well at approximately 215 units (214, 215, 215). The current date is March 25, 2019. In the retail calendar, late March typically maintains steady demand for spring blazers as professional and occasion wear interest remains high leading into April. There is no evidence of a further trend shift or a sudden seasonal peak/drop at this specific week in late March. Given the extreme stability over the last three periods, I will forecast a continuation of this stable mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 4-6 show a consistent mean of ~215 units following the initial Spring launch spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows an initial surge during the spring launch (Periods 1-2, average 255) followed by a stabilization period (Periods 4-6, average 215). In the most recent period (Period 7), demand dropped to 186 units. The current date is April 1st, 2019. While April usually sustains spring tailoring demand, the drop in Period 7 suggests a potential cooling of the initial launch phase or a transient dip. Given the stability observed in weeks 4-6 and the product's relevance to mid-spring workwear, the forecast assumes a slight recovery from the Period 7 dip, leaning towards the recent stabilized average while acknowledging the downward pressure from the most recent data point.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer showed a regime shift at the start of the Spring season (Feb 11), moving from a base average of ~173 to ~236. Following a stabilization phase around 215 units (Periods 4-6), demand fluctuated with a dip in Period 7 (186) and a sharp increase in Period 8 (249). The current date (April 8) is two weeks before Easter Sunday (April 21, 2019), a period typically associated with higher demand for 'dressed' categories like blazers. The spike to 249 in Period 8 suggests the start of this pre-holiday lift. I expect demand to remain elevated near this higher level as consumers shop for spring events, though it may moderate slightly from the immediate spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a fluctuating but relatively stable pattern since the Spring launch in February. The mean demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is approximately 209 units. Recent data shows significant volatility: Period 8 spiked to 249, followed by a drop to 178 in Period 9. The current date is April 15, 2019, which is the week leading up to Easter Sunday (April 21). In retail, 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' categories often see a pre-holiday uptick as consumers shop for holiday events and spring wardrobes. While Period 9 saw a dip (potentially a post-payday lull or temporary variance), the proximity to Easter and the mid-April spring transition suggests a rebound. I expect demand to recover from the Period 9 low toward the established mean, with a slight seasonal lift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial surge in demand during the Spring launch (Periods 1-3, avg ~236) followed by a stable period (Periods 4-6, avg ~215). However, a significant downward trend has emerged in the most recent periods. Period 8 (April 1st) saw a temporary spike to 249 (likely a month-beginning or promotion-driven bump), but demand has since dropped sharply to 178 (Period 9) and 130 (Period 10). The current date is April 22nd (Period 11), post-Easter, which typically sees a cooling of retail demand after the holiday peak. Given the steep decline over the last two weeks (down 48% from Period 8 to Period 10), the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization but at a lower floor, reflecting the cooling interest in this specific blazer as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed: Demand decreased from a stable mean of ~215 (Periods 4-6) to a recent mean of ~154 (Periods 9-10), representing a ~28% decline as the initial Spring peak fades.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant demand regime shift. After a stable period (P4-P6) averaging ~215 units and a localized spike in P8 (249 units), demand has entered a sharp downward trend. This aligns with the transition from the peak spring tailoring season into late April. The most recent observations (P10: 130, P11: 127) indicate that the decline has moved past the previous mean of ~154 identified in Period 11 and is potentially stabilizing at a lower level between 120-130 units. Given the consistent drop and the specific date (late April), I expect demand to remain near the most recent levels with a slight continued cooling effect.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) initially peaked in early Spring (Feb/March) around 215-230 units. Following a significant decline in mid-April (Periods 10-11) where demand dropped to ~128 units, Period 12 (Apr 29) saw a sharp recovery to 191 units. This recovery likely aligns with late Spring/early Summer demand for 'Dressed' tailoring (weddings, graduations, or seasonal events). Period 13 (May 6) is in the heart of this mid-spring demand window. While Period 12 showed a strong rebound, I expect a slight stabilization or moderate softening compared to that peak, as the immediate post-Easter/May Day surge settles. A forecast of 178 balances the recent upward momentum with the broader downward trend noted in Carry-over insights.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial high demand phase (Periods 1-6, avg ~225) followed by a decline as the peak Spring season passed. However, the most recent four periods (Periods 10-13) show a stabilization and slight recovery: 130, 127, 191, and 160. The average of these last four periods is 152. Period 12 (191) likely saw a boost from late April/early May holiday/event shopping. The current date is May 13, heading further into the late Spring/early Summer season for women's tailoring. While Period 13 dropped back to 160 from 191, it remains significantly higher than the lows of 127-130 seen in late April. Given the recent demand volatility and the 'Mariette Blazer' being a staple item, I expect demand to remain in the 150-170 range, slightly cooling from the previous peak but maintaining the new baseline established over the last two weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a fluctuating but generally declining trend from the early Spring peak (Avg ~215 in Periods 4-6). Recent data (Periods 12-14) shows demands of 191, 160, and 196, averaging 182 units. This represents a moderate recovery from the lows seen in Periods 10-11 (Avg ~128). As we are in late May (Current Date 2019/5/20), the Mariette Blazer (a 'Dressed' tailoring item) likely maintains steady demand for office wear and spring events, though it is past the initial seasonal launch surge. Period 14 (196) and Period 12 (191) suggest a stabilization near the 180-190 range. Given the slight upward momentum in the most recent observation compared to Period 13, I forecast a demand of 185.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a peak during the early Spring launch (Feb/March avg: ~236) followed by a stabilization period (March/April avg: ~215). As identified in Period 11, demand then trended downward to a mean of ~154. In the most recent four periods (P12-P15), demand has exhibited increased volatility (191, 160, 196, 143) with a mean of 172.5, which aligns closely with the initial training data mean (173.4). For Period 16 (May 27), the demand is expected to remain within this recent range. Although P15 saw a dip to 143, the alternating high-low pattern observed over the last four weeks suggests a potential return toward the recent mean of ~170, especially considering late-May retail activity.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows an initial spring peak (P1-P3 avg: 236), followed by a stabilization (P4-P6 avg: 215), and a subsequent decline (P10-P11 avg: ~128). Recent demand (P12-P16) indicates a moderate recovery and stabilization with a mean of 171.6. Specifically, the last three periods (196, 143, 168) show continued volatility but suggest a baseline above the April lows. As of June 3rd, the 'Mariette Blazer' (spring/summer tailoring) remains relevant but is past the peak spring season. Given the recent fluctuations and the mean of the most recent observations, I expect demand to remain within the 160-170 range. I will forecast near the recent 5-period average.

Carry-over insight: New demand stabilization confirmed: Following the post-peak decline, demand has stabilized between Periods 12-16 with a mean of ~172 units (+34% compared to the P10-P11 lows).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' has shown a peak in early Spring (Period 2) followed by a stabilization around 172 units (Periods 12-16). However, Period 17 (June 3) shows a significant drop to 118 units. Looking at the five most recent periods provided in the task summary [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], there is a slight discrepancy between the summary and the 'Observed Demand' list, but focusing on the detailed observed demand list: the last 6 periods are 191, 160, 196, 143, 168, 118. The mean of these recent periods is approximately 163. As we move further into June, the seasonal relevance of a 'Woven fabric blazer' typically begins to decline as temperatures rise, leading into summer sales or lower demand for tailoring. Given the sharp drop in Period 17 and the transition into mid-June, I expect demand to remain at this lower level or slightly recover toward the recent moving average, though likely staying below the Spring stabilization level of 172.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is seeing a decline in demand as the season shifts from Spring into mid-Summer (June). Historically, demand was higher during the Spring launch (Feb-March) and stabilized around 172 units during May (Periods 12-16). However, the two most recent observations (Period 17: 118, Period 18: 139) show a significant drop from that level, averaging 128.5 units. This suggests the previous stabilization has ended. Given the rising temperatures in mid-June, which typically reduces demand for structured blazers, I expect demand to remain at this lower level. My forecast of 134 is based on the average of the most recent two periods with a slight adjustment for the modest upward movement seen between P17 and P18.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer peaked in early spring (P1-P8) and underwent a secondary stabilization in May (P12-P16 avg: ~172). However, as we enter late June, demand has seen a significant downturn. The last three periods (P17-P19) show a mean of 126.3, a ~26% decrease from the May stabilization period. This likely reflects a seasonal shift as consumers move away from tailored blazers during peak summer temperatures. Given the consistency of the last three weeks (118, 139, 122), I expect the demand for Period 20 to remain in this lower range.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend/regime shift confirmed: Demand decreased from a mean of ~172 (Periods 12-16) to a recent mean of ~126 (Periods 17-19), representing a ~26% decline coinciding with the start of the summer season.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a product in a clear downward trend as it moves deep into the summer season. The Mariette Blazer (a tailored 'Dressed' item) is less seasonally relevant in July. Demand was relatively stable around 130 units in Periods 17-19, but plummeted to 73 units in Period 20 (a 40% drop from the previous three-period average). This sharp decline at the end of June/beginning of July aligns with typical mid-summer lulls for structured tailoring. Given the significant drop in Period 20, the forecast anticipates demand to remain at this new, lower level rather than immediately rebounding, as there are no major calendar drivers to stimulate blazer sales in early July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a seasonal decline typical for woven tailoring during the peak summer months. Historically, the demand regime shifted from a spring mean of ~172 (P12-P16) down to a mean of ~126 (P17-P19). Recent data shows a further reduction, with P20 (73) and P21 (116) averaging 94.5. While P21 showed a recovery from the sharp drop in P20, the overall volume remains constrained by the July heat, which reduces consumer interest in blazers. My forecast for P22 (July 8) anticipates demand staying within this lower mid-summer range, slightly below the June average but stable relative to the last two weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear downward trajectory as the year progresses from the Spring peak. (1) The Spring launch saw a peak mean of ~236 units (P1-P3), which stabilized at ~215 (P4-P6), and later ~172 (P12-P16). (2) Entering the summer season (June/July), a regime shift was identified with demand dropping to a mean of ~126 (P17-P19). (3) Recent performance (P20-P22) shows a sharp dip to 73 followed by a recovery to 116 and 120. (4) For Period 23 (July 15), the demand is expected to remain in this lower summer regime. The recovery in the last two weeks suggests the 73-unit dip in Period 20 was a temporary outlier rather than a new downward trend. I forecast demand to stay consistent with the recent two-week average of ~118.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern. After a spring peak (P1-P9) and a subsequent stabilization period (P12-P16 at ~172 units), demand underwent a regime shift downward as summer began. Periods 17-19 averaged ~126 units, followed by a sharp dip in Period 20 (73 units). However, the most recent three periods (P21-P23) show a recovery and strong stabilization with demands of 116, 120, and 120 (mean ~119). Given the current date is July 22, we are in the middle of the summer lull for professional tailoring like blazers. There is no evidence yet of a 'back-to-office' surge which typically starts in August. Therefore, I expect demand to remain stable at the current level observed over the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 21-23 show a consistent mean of ~119 units, representing a new summer floor after the decline from the mid-spring mean of ~172.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is a structured, lined garment typically associated with professional or dressed-up occasions, which generally experiences lower demand during the peak summer months (July). Historical data shows a recent stabilization around 116-120 units (Periods 21-23), which was interrupted by a sharp decline to 63 units in Period 24 (July 22). This mirrors a previous temporary dip seen in Period 20 (73 units). While the product may see a slight recovery from the Period 24 low as it exits the deepest part of the July slump, demand is expected to remain significantly below the spring/early summer averages until the transition into the Autumn season begins. Therefore, I am forecasting a slight recovery towards the recent floor, tempered by the seasonality of late July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear downward progression from a spring mean of ~215 to a mid-summer floor of ~119 (Periods 21-23). However, Periods 24 and 25 (63 and 94 units respectively) show a significant drop below that floor, likely representing the deepest part of the summer clearance/slump. The current date is August 5th, which traditionally marks the beginning of the 'Back to Office' and early Autumn transition period for tailoring categories like blazers. Following the partial recovery in Period 25 from the Period 24 low, I expect demand to continue trending upward toward the previous floor of ~119 as seasonal interest in professional wear begins to rebuild.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a summer floor of ~119 units (Periods 21-23) followed by a sharp drop to 63 in Period 24. Since then, demand has shown a significant recovery trend: 94 in Period 25 (+49%) and 146 in Period 26 (+55%). This trajectory aligns with the 'Back to Business' seasonal driver typical for mid-August as consumers shift from summer wear to tailoring like the Mariette Blazer. Given the momentum and the product's historical stabilization levels around 172 (Periods 12-16), I expect demand to continue its upward climb towards that previous baseline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant seasonal regime shift. Historical data shows high demand (200-280 units) during the Spring launch (Feb/Mar), followed by a decline to a summer floor of approximately 119 units. Currently, demand has surged over the last three periods (P25: 94, P26: 146, P27: 301), coinciding with the mid-August 'Back to Office' and Autumn transition. The jump to 301 in Period 27 suggests a peak similar to the Spring launch. While demand is expected to remain high during this seasonal window, historical peaks for this SKU (like Period 2) often experience a slight stabilization or correction after an initial surge. Therefore, I forecast a strong demand of 272, reflecting the new high-demand regime while accounting for a potential slight cooling from the immediate P27 spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime shift confirmed: Demand surged from a summer mean of ~119 to 301 in P27 (+153%), signaling the start of the 'Back to Office' season and a return to high-volume Spring-like levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-volume Autumn/Back-to-Office regime. Following the summer floor of ~119 units, Period 27 saw a massive spike to 301, and Period 28 recorded 251. This represents a significant upward shift, similar to the high-demand periods seen in early Spring. The current date (late August) typically aligns with professional wardrobe updates. While demand is high, the drop from 301 to 251 suggests the initial 'shock' of the new season is stabilizing. For Period 29 (August 26), I expect demand to remain in this elevated range but slightly normalize as the peak surge levels out. A forecast of 235 units reflects a slight tapering from the initial peak while maintaining the strong seasonal momentum.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 27 (August 12), with demand jumping from a summer floor of ~119 to a peak of 301. This aligns with the 'Back to Office' seasonal driver for a tailored blazer. Since the peak, demand has seen a tapering trend (301 -> 251 -> 231). For Period 30 (Sept 2), demand is expected to remain high as the autumn season continues, though the initial surge is likely to stabilize. Given the recent trajectory and the mean of the last three periods (~261), I predict a slight further moderation as the immediate peak subsides.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand stabilization: Periods 27-29 show a mean of ~261 units (+119% over the summer floor), establishing a high-volume regime for the 'Back to Office' season.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing its 'Back to Office' autumn peak. Historical data shows a clear regime shift starting in mid-August (Period 27), with demand moving from a summer floor of ~119 units to a high-volume autumn average. In the most recent four periods (P27-P30), demand has averaged 285 units. Period 30 saw a significant spike to 357 units (the highest in the dataset), likely driven by the start of September/Labor Day retail activity. While Period 30 was an outlier on the high side, the underlying trend remains strong for professional tailoring in early September. I expect demand to remain in the 300+ range but stabilize slightly lower than the immediate P30 peak, centering the forecast between the P27-P30 mean and the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 30 shows demand acceleration to 357 units, lifting the autumn regime mean (P27-P30) to 285 units (+140% vs summer floor).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-volume autumn/back-to-office regime starting Period 27. Recent performance shows an intensification of this trend, with demand in Period 30 (357) and Period 31 (328) significantly exceeding the initial autumn surge average. The mean for the entire autumn period (P27-P31) is ~294 units, but the most recent two-week average has climbed to ~343 units. Given that mid-September is a peak seasonal window for women's tailoring, I expect demand to remain elevated near this new higher baseline, though a slight natural cooling from the absolute peak of 357 is likely as the initial seasonal refresh settles.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime consolidation: Periods 27-31 show a sustained mean of ~294 units (+147% vs summer floor), with the most recent two weeks (P30-P31) establishing a higher support level near 340 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a clear autumn regime shift starting in Period 27. Demand significantly accelerated from an initial autumn mean of ~261 (P27-P29) to a higher support level of ~342 over the last three periods (P30: 357, P31: 328, P32: 341). As we are in late September (2019/09/23), the Mariette Blazer remains highly relevant for 'Back to Office' and transitional seasonal wardrobes. Given the low variance and strong consolidation at this higher tier over the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain stable near the current mean of 342.

Carry-over insight: New demand support level confirmed: Periods 30-32 show a sustained mean of ~342 units (+16% increase from the initial Autumn mean of 261), establishing a high-volume peak for the blazer category.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal surge for the Mariette Blazer starting in mid-August (Period 27), corresponding with the 'Back to Office' autumn season. Demand stabilized around 342 units between Periods 30 and 32. However, Period 33 (Sept 23) saw a massive spike to 612 units (+79% over the previous 3-week mean). While this spike is significant, it likely represents a peak promotional event or a specific end-of-month seasonal acceleration rather than a new sustainable baseline of 600+ units. Following such an extreme outlier in the blazer category, demand typically mean-reverts toward the established seasonal support level while maintaining some upward momentum from the high-traffic period. Therefore, the forecast for Period 34 (Sept 30) anticipates a correction from the 612 peak, settling at a level slightly above the previous 340-unit stabilization to account for the heightened autumn interest.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout: Period 33 recorded a record high of 612 units, significantly exceeding the previous Autumn stabilization mean of ~342 (+79%). Further periods are required to determine if this represents a new regime or a temporary peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Autumn 'Back to Office' season. Period 33 showed a massive spike to 612 units, which Period 34 (313 units) confirms was a temporary outlier rather than a new sustained regime. Excluding the outlier, demand has stabilized in a high-volume range: the mean for Periods 30, 31, 32, and 34 is approximately 335 units. This aligns with the 'Autumn high-demand stabilization' identified in the carry-over insights (mean ~342). As we are still in early October, a high-demand month for tailoring, the forecast is set near the recent stable mean, slightly adjusted for the most recent observation of 313.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a massive Autumn surge ('Back to Office') starting at Period 27, establishing a high-demand regime with a mean of ~300 units. Period 33 experienced an exceptional peak of 612 units, which has since corrected in Period 34 (313 units) and Period 35 (283 units). The current demand (283) is returning to the established Autumn stabilization level (P27-P32 mean of ~301). Given the slight downward trend over the last two weeks (313 to 283) as the initial Autumn peak seasonal cooling begins in mid-October, a forecast slightly below the most recent observation is prudent to account for continued normalization.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak normalization: Following the Period 33 spike (612), demand has returned to the previously established Autumn high-volume regime, with Period 34-35 averaging 298 units, confirming the P33 event was a temporary outlier rather than a new regime shift.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in the Autumn/Back-to-Office regime. Following the significant temporary spike in Period 33 (612 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P34-P36) with an average of approximately 293 units (313, 283, 282). The most recent two weeks (P35-P36) show very consistent demand at 283 and 282 units respectively. As we move further into late October, the initial Autumn surge typically levels off as consumers transition toward heavier winter outerwear. I expect demand for Period 37 to remain consistent with this recent stabilization level, slightly below the broader Autumn average of ~294 to reflect the minor tapering observed in the last two weeks.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized into a consistent late-autumn regime following the outlier spike in Period 33 (612 units). Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has fluctuated within a narrow band of 282 to 313 units, yielding a mean of approximately 298 units. This level aligns with the 'Autumn high-demand regime consolidation' identified in Period 32 (mean ~294). Given the stability of the recent four weeks and the continued relevance of tailored blazers in late October for professional and indoor wear, the forecast for Period 38 is set at 303, reflecting the average of the most recent stabilized demand window.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its high-demand autumn season. Following the normalization in October where demand averaged approximately 298 units (Periods 34-37), Period 38 (Oct 28) saw a significant uptick to 385 units (+23% vs. the Oct average). This increase aligns with the transition into November, a month typically characterized by rising retail demand due to pre-holiday shopping and seasonal events like Singles' Day (Nov 11). Given the positive momentum from the last two periods (313 to 385), I expect demand to continue climbing slightly in the first week of November as consumers prepare for mid-month promotions and late autumn wardrobing.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:

The autumn high-demand regime, established in Period 27, has shown a consistent support level around ~298 units (Periods 34-37). Period 38 saw a temporary spike to 385, followed by a significant drop in Period 39 to 231 units (-40%). While Period 39 is the lowest volume seen in 10 weeks, it does not yet constitute a confirmed regime shift (requires 3+ periods). The forecast for Period 40 (beginning Nov 11) anticipates a slight recovery from the Period 39 low, returning closer to the established autumn mean of ~290, while accounting for potential pre-holiday retail softening.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a sustained high-demand regime for this blazer since the 'Back to Office' season started in August (Period 27), with demand generally fluctuating between 280 and 340 units. Recent performance (Periods 36-40) shows an average of ~298 units, despite a brief dip in Period 39 (231) and a peak in Period 38 (385). The current date (Nov 18) precedes the Black Friday period (Nov 29, 2019). For a 'Womens Tailoring/Dressed' product, mid-to-late November typically maintains steady demand driven by early holiday social events and pre-sale interest. The recovery from 231 in P39 to 278 in P40 suggests a return to the established mean. I forecast demand to remain near the current seasonal average of ~290-300 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a high-volume autumn regime starting Period 27, with demand stabilizing between 250-315 units (excluding the P33 outlier). Recent demand in Periods 39-41 has averaged 251 units, showing a slight cooling compared to October peaks. However, Period 42 (2019/11/25 - 2019/12/01) covers the Black Friday retail event. For a 'Womens Tailoring' product, Black Friday typically drives a significant surge in demand. Given the product's previous ability to spike (612 units in P33) and its autumn baseline, I anticipate a lift of approximately 50-60% above the recent 250-unit mean to account for holiday shopping traffic.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer operates in a high-demand regime for the autumn/winter season, with a stable baseline of ~280 units (Periods 34-41 mean: 281). Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive spike to 733 units (+161% vs. baseline), clearly attributable to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activity. Period 43 (Dec 2) represents the post-Cyber Monday week. Historically, following similar one-off spikes (e.g., the Period 33 surge to 612), demand tends to normalize back to the established seasonal regime. Given that we are now entering early December, demand for tailored blazers typically softens slightly as consumer focus shifts toward festive wear and gift-giving rather than office tailoring, but remains supported by the broader winter season. I expect demand to revert from the promotional peak toward the previous stabilization level, with a slight downward adjustment for the post-holiday lull.

Carry-over insight: Holiday promotion spike confirmed: Period 42 demand surged to 733 units (+161% over the autumn baseline of ~280) due to Black Friday/Cyber Week events. Initial data suggests this is a temporary event rather than a regime shift.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered the post-Black Friday phase. Period 42 saw a significant promotional spike (733 units), which was followed by a sharp correction in Period 43 (169 units). This 'post-promotion valley' is common as consumer demand is often pulled forward into the discount week. For Period 44 (Dec 9), I anticipate a partial recovery toward the established autumn/winter baseline. While the pre-peak baseline was approximately 280-300 units (Periods 34-41 mean ~291), the week following a major sale often remains slightly suppressed. Therefore, the forecast predicts a moderate increase from the Period 43 low, returning toward the lower end of the seasonal range as holiday event shopping continues.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has returned to its established autumn/winter baseline (~280-300 units) following the significant Black Friday spike in Period 42 (733 units) and the subsequent post-promotion slump in Period 43 (169 units). Period 44 (304 units) confirms a recovery to the pre-promotion mean. For Period 45 (December 16), demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase due to late holiday shopping for 'Dressed' tailoring ahead of Christmas and New Year's Eve events. Given that P44 recorded 304 units and the pre-peak baseline was around 292, a forecast near the upper end of the baseline is appropriate to account for minor seasonal gift/party demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a high-volume autumn/winter baseline for this blazer, averaging approximately 280-300 units (excluding promotional spikes). Recent demand post-Black Friday has been volatile (P43: 169, P44: 304, P45: 258). The current period (P46) falls on the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). Retail demand for 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' typically sees a seasonal decline during the actual holiday week as the window for holiday party shopping closes and consumer focus shifts away from professional/formal attire. Given the 15% decrease from P44 to P45, I anticipate a further seasonal dip for the Christmas period, targeting a level closer to the spring stabilization mean of ~215.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis indicates the 'Mariette Blazer' maintains an Autumn/Winter baseline mean of approximately 280-300 units (Periods 34-41). Period 42 saw a major Black Friday spike (733), followed by a correction. Period 46 (Dec 23-29) shows a significant seasonal drop to 128 units, which is typical for the Christmas holiday week as consumer focus shifts away from professional tailoring. For Period 47 (Dec 30-Jan 5), demand is expected to begin a recovery toward the baseline as the 'New Year, Back to Office' mindset starts to influence shopping behavior, although it likely remains below the full baseline level due to the tail-end of the holiday season. I expect a moderate rebound from the Christmas trough.
