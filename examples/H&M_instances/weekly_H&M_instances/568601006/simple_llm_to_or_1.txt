======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical Pattern Summary: The training data shows a reasonably stable demand ranging from 145 to 196, with a five-period average of 173.4. (2) Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The current date is February 11th, which is in the lead-up to the Spring season. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this item is likely to see increased demand as consumers transition to Spring office and formal wear. (3) Recent Trend Analysis: The last two observations (196 and 186) are slightly higher than the earlier values (161, 145), suggesting a potential upward tilt as February progresses. (4) Final Forecast Logic: Given the upcoming Spring seasonality and the recent lift in demand, I expect demand to remain at the higher end of the observed range, projecting 190 for the next period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Data shows demands ranging from 145 to 196 in the training set (avg: 173). 2. Recent Observed Data: Period 1 (Feb 11) saw a significant jump to 227 units, which is 15% higher than the previous training peak. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: Period 2 (Feb 18) follows the mid-February transition where 'Womens Tailoring' like the Mariette Blazer often sees increased demand as professional/spring wardrobes are refreshed. The transition from winter to spring garments usually starts mid-February. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the sharp increase in Period 1 (227) compared to the training average (173), I expect the momentum to continue or stabilize as the spring season ramps up. I will forecast a slight further increase to reflect the seasonal trend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) was stable between 145 and 196 units (avg ~173). In the current test phase, we observe a significant upward shift: Period 1 recorded 227 units and Period 2 recorded 284 units. This represents a clear demand regime change. The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, which typically sees rising demand in late February/early March as consumers prepare for spring office wear and transition out of winter coats. The jump from 227 to 284 indicates strong positive momentum. For Period 3 (2019/2/25), I expect a slight further increase or stabilization at this higher level as spring shopping peak approaches.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: demand has increased from a historical average of 173 to a current average of 255 (+47%), likely driven by seasonal demand for spring tailoring.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (5 periods) showed an average of 173 units. Recent test phase data for Period 1-3 shows a new average of 236 units (227, 284, 198), confirming the previously identified regime shift toward higher spring demand for tailoring. Period 3 saw a dip to 198 units, which may be a stabilization after a peak in Period 2 or a temporary minor fluctuation. Given the current date (March 4th) marks the beginning of peak spring shopping season for office wear like Blazers, demand is expected to remain elevated compared to historical levels. I will forecast a slight recovery from the Period 3 dip, aligning with the current regime average of ~236-240.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training average was approximately 173 units. During the current observation period (P1-P4), demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 231 units, which aligns with seasonal demand for spring tailoring (blazers). After a peak in P2 (284) and a subsequent correction in P3 (198), P4 showed a slight recovery to 214. Given the date (March 11) is prime transition season for spring office wear, I expect demand to remain stable or slightly increase from the recent average. My forecast assumes the demand will stabilize around the current test period mean (220-230 range).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 173 units. Since entering the 'Test Phase' (Period 1-5), the demand has shifted to a higher level, averaging 227.6 units. Specifically, while the carry-over insight noted a shift to 255, the most recent four periods (P2-P5) have stabilized around a mean of 227 units (284, 198, 214, 215). The current date is March 18, which is mid-spring, a peak season for women's tailoring (Mariette Blazer). Demand has remained very consistent over the last two weeks (214 and 215 units). Given the stability of the recent trend and the seasonal relevance of the product in March, I expect the demand to remain within this established new regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a mean demand of approximately 173. Since the start of the test phase (Period 1), demand has shifted upward, coinciding with the spring fashion season for tailoring. Following an early peak in Period 2 (284), demand has entered a highly stable plateau. Specifically, Periods 4, 5, and 6 have recorded 214, 215, and 215 units respectively. Given this extreme stability and the fact that late March is a peak window for blazer sales, the forecast projects a continuation of this stable trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization: Following the early spring spike, demand has stabilized at a plateau of ~215 units (Periods 4-6), representing a sustained 24% increase over the historical training mean (173).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to -1) averaged 173 units. Since entering the Test Phase (Period 1), the product (Womens Dressed Blazer) saw an initial peak in February (Avg 236), which stabilized in early-to-mid March at exactly 215 units for three consecutive weeks (Periods 4-6). Period 7 (March 25) shows a notable drop to 186 units (-13.5% vs previous period). This likely reflects a post-peak stabilization or a minor dip before mid-spring demand fluctuates. As we enter Period 8 (April 1st), the blazer still benefits from spring office-wear seasonality, but the immediate momentum has cooled. I expect demand to remain near the Period 7 level or slightly recover as the 'plateau' of 215 documented in the Insights seems to be breaking downward. I am forecasting a slight recovery towards the 200 level, acknowledging the recent softening.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed a mean of 173. In the test phase, the item experienced a surge (Periods 1-2) followed by stabilization (Periods 4-6) around 215 units. Period 7 saw a dip to 186, while Period 8 jumped significantly to 249 units. This recent volatility corresponds with late March/early April, a high-demand period for professional 'Dressed' products like the Mariette Blazer as spring wardrobes and event season (Easter/Graduations) approach. April 8th (Period 9) typically continues this seasonal momentum. The average of the last 4 periods is 216, but with the specific jump to 249 in Period 8, a slight bullish adjustment is warranted while remaining anchored to the established 215-220 plateau.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to -1) averaged 173 units. Since entering the test phase, there was an initial surge (Avg P1-P2: 255) followed by a stabilization phase (Avg P3-P6: 210). However, the most recent window (P7-P9) has shown increased volatility with demand fluctuating between 178 and 249 units. Period 9 saw 178 units. Period 10 (April 15th) falls within the peak spring shopping window for professional 'Womens Tailoring' as temperatures rise and the spring social/professional calendar intensifies. Given the recent oscillation (186, 249, 178), a mean-reverting approach toward the established post-training baseline of ~210-215 is appropriate, while accounting for the likely mid-month spring demand boost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis (Periods 1-10) shows a fluctuating yet generally declining trend from the early March peak. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', categorized as 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring', which typically sees high demand in early-to-mid spring for workwear and events. Recent demand (Periods 8-10) has dropped from 249 to 130, with Period 10 showing a significant 27% decrease from Period 9. The current date is April 22 (Period 11), following Easter weekend (April 21). Historically, post-holiday periods often see a temporary dip or a slight recovery if demand was suppressed by store closures. Given the sharp drop in Period 10, a minor mean-reversion is expected, but the overall trend for spring blazers post-Easter tends towards a seasonal slowdown as the transition to summer wear begins. I predict a slight stabilization around the 145 level.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed since Period 8: Demand has declined from a peak of ~250 to a recent average of 154 over the last 3 periods (-38%), indicating the end of the peak spring tailoring season.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~173 units. Following a significant spring peak (reaching 284 in Period 2 and 249 in Period 8), demand has entered a sharp contraction phase as the primary spring tailoring season concludes. Recent observations show Period 10 (130) and Period 11 (127) are significantly below both the peak levels and the historical training average. The rate of decline has slowed between the last two periods (-2%), suggesting demand is beginning to find a new low-season floor. For Period 12 (late April/early May), I expect demand to remain stable at this lower level or experience a slight further seasonal taper as weather warms, moving away from structured woven blazers.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis: The training mean was 173.4. Test period data shows a strong start in Feb (avg ~236) and March (avg ~208), followed by a volatile April. April saw a spike to 249 (P8) followed by a sharp drop into the 130s (P10-11), likely surrounding the Easter holiday (April 21, 2019). Period 12 (April 29) shows a strong recovery to 191 units. Seasonal/Calendar analysis: Period 13 (May 6) enters the peak spring/early summer season for women's tailoring ('Mariette Blazer'). This period is often characterized by preparation for formal events (weddings, graduations). Recent trend analysis: The recovery in P12 (191) from the P11 low (127) suggests that the downward trend mentioned in Period 11 has reversed or stabilized. Calculation: The average of the last four periods (P9-P12) is 156.5, but the momentum is currently upward. Expecting demand to align closer to the pre-holiday baseline of roughly 180-200.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. During the test period, demand peaked in early spring (P1-P8) but saw a confirmed downward trend in P10-P11 (averaging 128) as the primary spring tailoring season peaked. However, Periods 12 and 13 show a moderate rebound (191 and 160 respectively, average 175.5), which aligns with the historical training mean and suggests a stabilization in May for late-spring/early-summer occasions (graduations, weddings). Given the current date of May 13, I expect demand to remain within this stabilized range of 150-180. I will forecast slightly above the most recent period to account for the stabilization trend seen after the April trough.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173. Following a significant dip in Periods 10-11 (averaging 128.5), demand has seen a meaningful recovery over the last three periods (191, 160, 196), with a new average of ~182. This recovery coincides with the mid-to-late May period, which typically sees demand for blazer styles due to formal events like graduations and weddings. Recent momentum (196 in the latest period) suggests demand is stabilizing slightly above the historical mean but below the early spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Trend reversal: The downward trend noted in Period 11 has been countered by a recovery in Periods 12-14, with average demand increasing from ~128 to 182 (+42%), realigning with historical norms and seasonal event demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' (a dressed/tailored item) has shown significant volatility in the test phase, oscillating between various regimes. Following a dip in April (Periods 10-11), demand recovered to an average of ~182 units across Periods 12-14. However, Period 15 saw a drop to 143 units. The current date (2019/5/27) coincides with the US Memorial Day holiday and the typical start of the warmer summer season, where interest in 'woven fabric' Blazers may begin to soften compared to the peak spring tailoring window. Given the recent average (approx. 165 over the last 4 periods) and the specific drop in Period 15, I expect demand to remain in the lower range of the current stabilized regime, factoring in a slight seasonal cooling as summer approaches.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Upper body/Tailoring) shows a peak in early spring (Feb-April) followed by a stabilization phase. The recent 5 periods (Periods 12-16) show a fluctuating but generally stable demand level with an average of 171.6 units. Period 16 recorded 168 units. The date 2019/06/03 enters the beginning of summer, where demand for 'Dressed' tailored blazers typically softens compared to the spring wedding/graduation season, though it remains a staple. Given the lack of a strong directional trend in the immediate last 3 periods (196, 143, 168), a forecast slightly below the recent 5-period average is appropriate to account for the gradual seasonal transition.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a peak in early spring (March/April) followed by a cooling period heading into summer. Recent observations (Periods 15-17) show a downward shift: 143, 168, and 118. The average of the last 3 periods is 143, which is significantly lower than the historical training mean (173) and the previous stabilization level (~182 reported in Period 15). June 10th marks the transition into mid-summer, where demand for tailored 'dressed' jackets typically softens as consumers shift toward lighter apparel. Period 17's sharp drop to 118 suggests a new downward pressure aligned with summer seasonality. I expect demand to remain low or slightly decline further as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Downward seasonal shift: Demand in early June (Periods 15-17) has dropped to an average of 143, a 21% decrease from the previous maintenance level of ~182, confirming the seasonal end of peak blazer demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in a seasonally low period as we progress further into June. Historical data shows a significant decline from the spring peak (Avg ~215) to a more recent lower average. In the last four periods (Periods 15-18), demand has averaged 142 units, with the most recent two periods at 118 and 139 units. Analysis of the seasonal context for 'Womens Tailoring' suggests that interest in heavy blazers typically wanes in mid-to-late summer. Given the recent performance and the established downward seasonal shift noted in Period 18, I expect demand to remain in the 120-140 range. I will forecast a slight stabilization near the recent 4-period average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' shows a distinct seasonal pattern. After a spring peak reaching up to 284 units, the demand has entered a downward phase as the weather warms (early summer). Recent demand for the last five periods (Periods 15-19) has been: 143, 168, 118, 139, and 122. The average for the last three periods (Periods 17-19) is approximately 126 units, significantly lower than the historical baseline of 173 and the previous stability levels near 180. The Current Date (6/24) marks the transition into mid-summer, a period typically characterized by lower demand for heavy woven blazers and formal tailoring. The trend is currently moving between 120 and 140 units. Given the most recent period demand of 122 and the prevailing downward seasonal pressure, the forecast anticipates a slight stabilization or continued minor softening near the current mean.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant seasonal downturn as it enters the peak summer month (July). Historical demand has been trending downward since Period 16 (168), accelerating significantly in Period 20 with a drop to 73 units (-40% from Period 19). This shift is consistent with retail patterns where dressed tailoring demand troughs in mid-summer before the pre-fall transition. The forecast for Period 21 anticipates demand remaining at this lower summer baseline, with a slight stabilization adjustment from the sharp drop in Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average demand for late June (Periods 18-20) has declined to 111 units, a 22% decrease from the previous June average of 143, reflecting the seasonal low for fitted jackets.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer (SKU 568601006) has shown a clear seasonal decline moving into the summer months. The 'Mid-summer demand trough' identified in the Carry-over Insights is evident, with demand dropping from a mid-May average of ~180 to a late-June average of 111. Recent periods (17-21) show values of 118, 139, 122, 73, and 116. The current date (2019/7/8) is in the middle of summer, which is typically the low season for structured, lined tailoring like this 'Mariette Blazer'. Period 21 saw a slight recovery to 116 from the anomalous drop to 73 in Period 20, suggesting demand is currently oscillating around a new low-level mean. Given the downward seasonal pressure and the average of the last 5 periods (approximately 114), I expect demand to remain stable at this lower plateau before any fall/autumn recovery begins.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis indicates that the 'Mariette Blazer' has entered a mid-summer trough. Since Period 18, demand has consistently stayed low, averaging approximately 107 units. Recent demand (Periods 21-22) shows a slight stabilization at 116 and 120 units, recovering slightly from the Period 20 low of 73. Given the date of July 15th, we are in the peak of the summer clearance/holiday season where demand for 'fitted jackets in woven fabric' is seasonally low compared to spring. There is no evidence of a trend reversal yet, as the recent average of ~118 remains consistent with the mid-summer trough identified in carry-over insights. I expect Period 23 to remain within this stabilized low-demand range.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal cycle. After a spring peak (averaging ~215-250 units), demand entered a downward trend as summer approached. Carry-over insights recorded a mid-summer trough in late June/early July (Period 21), dropping to an average of 111. Recent data (Periods 21-23) shows stabilization at a slightly higher level: 116, 120, and 120. This indicates demand has found a floor during the height of summer (late July). As we are still in the mid-summer period (July 22nd) before the 'Back to Business' autumn tailoring surge typically begins in August, I expect demand to remain flat and consistent with the most recent three periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer floor established: Demand has stabilized at an average of 119 units over Periods 21-23, marking the end of the seasonal decline observed since May.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer (SKU 568601006) showed a mid-summer floor of ~119 units (Periods 21-23), but Period 24 (July 22nd) saw a sharp drop to 63 units. This aligns with late-July clearance patterns or the deepest point of the summer low before 'Back to School' or 'Early Autumn' tailoring interest begins in August. Given the date (July 29th), we are at the very end of the summer trough. While Period 24 was exceptionally low (63), it likely represents a bottoming-out effect. I expect demand to remain low but potentially see a minor technical correction or early interest for the coming week as August approaches, though not yet a full recovery.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a significant seasonal decline throughout the summer, hitting a mid-summer trough. The carry-over insights identified a 'floor' around 119 units (Periods 21-23), but recent data shows a further drop: Period 24 (63 units) and Period 25 (94 units) average 78.5 units. However, we are entering early August (Period 26, 2019/8/5). This period typically marks the beginning of the 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn transition in retail, where demand for tailored items like blazers begins to recover from July lows. Period 25 already showed a 49% increase from Period 24 (63 to 94). I expect this upward recovery to continue as seasonal interest in 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' categories builds ahead of September.

Carry-over insight: Early autumn recovery detected: Following the mid-summer trough (avg ~79 in Periods 24-25), demand is beginning to trend upward in early August as consumers transition back to workwear.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is showing a strong recovery in early August (Period 26: 146 units), moving away from the mid-summer trough (avg ~79 in Periods 24-25). Historically, blazers see a significant lift during the mid-to-late August 'back-to-work' season. Given the momentum of the last two periods (+31 and +52 units respectively), I anticipate demand will continue to climb toward the historical training average (~173) and May maintenance levels (~182).

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Demand has risen for three consecutive periods (P24-P26), increasing from 63 to 146 units as the market transitions from summer lows back to seasonal tailoring requirements.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows strong seasonality related to back-to-work and spring tailoring. After a mid-summer trough (avg ~92 units in P24-P25), demand has surged significantly in August. Period 26 saw a rise to 146, and Period 27 spiked to 301 units, representing a 106% jump. This volatility is characteristic of the late-August 'Back to School' and 'Back to Office' retail window, where demand for tailored pieces like the Mariette Blazer accelerates as summer ends. Given the sharp ascent in the last two periods (63 -> 146 -> 301), we are in an aggressive upward trend. While Period 27 may be the peak of this specific spike, the momentum remains strong for late August. I expect demand to remain highly elevated but potentially stabilize or slightly pull back from the 301 local peak as the initial transition surge levels off.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased from a mid-summer average of 92 (P24-P25) to over 220 (P26-P27) as the market enters the peak back-to-office cycle.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows strong cyclicality tied to workwear seasons. After a mid-summer trough (Periods 24-25 avg: 78.5), demand surged in August (Periods 26-28) with values of 146, 301, and 251. This surge aligns with the 'back-to-office' peak demand period for autumn tailoring identified in the carry-over insights. Recent demand has averaged ~233 units over the last three weeks. Given that we are now in late August (2019/8/26), demand is expected to remain high but may begin to stabilize as the initial peak surge of the back-to-work season passes. I predict a high volume slightly below the recent 2-week average to account for potential stabilization after the initial peak spike.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring peak (Feb-March), a summer trough (June-July), and a strong autumn recovery starting in August for back-to-office shopping. Recent data (Periods 26-29) shows a dramatic surge, peaking at 301 and then gradually cooling to 251 and 231. Current date is Sept 2nd, which is typically the height of the back-to-school/work cycle. While the initial surge of the recovery has passed its absolute peak, demand remains significantly elevated above the summer average. Given the slight cooling trend over the last three periods (301 -> 251 -> 231) as the initial 'new season' rush settles, I expect a further moderate stabilization within the 200-220 range while remaining in the peak autumn sales period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau: Demand has sustained an average of 261 units over the last three periods (P27-P29), up from a mid-summer floor of 119 units, confirming the peak back-to-office seasonal regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for the 'Mariette Blazer' shows a significant seasonal regime shift starting in late August. Demand transitioned from a mid-summer floor (avg ~119) into a peak autumn back-to-office cycle. Over the last four periods (P27-P30), demand has averaged approximately 285 units, with the most recent period (P30) hitting a cycle high of 357 units. This volatility is characteristic of seasonal tailoring peaks. For Period 31 (2019/09/09), the trend remains strong as the autumn work season is in full effect. While P30 saw a sharp spike, the preceding three periods (P27-P29) averaged 261, suggesting that while 357 might be an outlier, the baseline has shifted significantly higher. I expect demand to remain in this high-activity plateau, slightly correcting from the P30 peak but staying well above the 250-unit mark.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently experiencing its peak autumn 'back-to-office' demand regime. Historical data shows a significant shift from the mid-summer low (~119 units) to a high-volume plateau starting in mid-August. Over the last five periods (P27-P31), the average demand has surged to 293.6 units, with the most recent two weeks (P30 and P31) hitting 357 and 328 respectively. The carry-over insight from Period 30 confirmed an autumn peak plateau; however, the data since then suggests the peak is slightly higher than previously estimated. As we move into mid-September, demand typically remains strong for tailored workwear before the transition into heavier winter garments. I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly stabilize after the initial September surge, following the slight decline from 357 to 328.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak revision: Demand for mid-August through early September (P27-P31) has averaged ~294 units, representing a sustained high-demand regime significantly above the earlier spring peak (~255).

Historical data shows a strong seasonal recovery starting in August (P26) as the market transitions to autumn workwear. Recent demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has moved into a higher-level plateau, averaging 342 units compared to the early-August ramp-up average of ~260. Given the current date (Sept 23) aligns with peak demand for tailored jackets like the Mariette Blazer, I expect demand to remain stable within this high-volume regime. My forecast of 338 follows the recent three-week average while accounting for the slight volatility seen in the 325-360 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime elevation confirmed: Sept demand (P30-P32) has stabilized at a high-peak average of 342 units, a 16% increase over the initial late-summer recovery average (P27-P29: 261).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer (Womens Tailoring) shows a significant seasonal peak during late summer and early autumn as part of the 'back-to-office' cycle. The carry-over insights and recent data indicate a demand regime elevation in September (P30-P32 averaging ~342). However, Period 33 (Sept 23) shows a massive outlier of 612 units, which is nearly double the previous high-peak average. While this indicates extreme momentum or a specific promotional event/seasonal climax in late September, I must exercise caution in assuming this level will sustain permanently as we transition into October (P34). The current date is Sept 30, which often sees high volume before a potential cooling period in mid-autumn. Following the guideline to weight recent observations appropriately while being conservative with extreme spikes, I will forecast a value that respects the increased demand level while adjusting for the likelihood that Period 33 was an exceptional peak.

Carry-over insight: Exceptional demand spike in Period 33: Demand reached 612 units (+79% over the previous 3-period average), signaling a potential late-September seasonal climax or promotional peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601 (Mariette Blazer) has been characterized by a strong autumn seasonal peak starting mid-August. In the recent four periods (P30-P33), demand reached a high plateau averaging 409 units, interrupted by a significant outlier of 612 in Period 33. The most recent demand in Period 34 (313 units) shows a return to the pre-spike plateau level (P30-P32 avg: 342), indicating that the Period 33 spike was a transitory event. As we enter early October, historical seasonal patterns for tailored workwear typically maintain a high level before the late autumn cooling. Forecasting a continuation of the stabilized autumn regime around the 310-330 range.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for this 'Mariette Blazer' shows a strong seasonal cycle, with a major peak occurring in the 'back-to-office' autumn window (September). Recently, demand reached an exceptional high of 612 units in Period 33 (late September), followed by a notable decline to 313 (P34) and 283 (P35) in early October. This indicates that the seasonal peak has passed and the category is entering a typical mid-autumn cooling phase. The average of the last two periods is 298. Moving into mid-October (Period 36), I anticipate a continued soft descent from the September highs while still maintaining a baseline significantly higher than summer levels due to the autumn tailoring utility. I forecast a demand of 265, following the recent downward trajectory while acknowledging the historical core demand for this item during the shoulder season.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak decline confirmed: Since the seasonal high in Period 33 (612 units), demand has decreased by over 50% and stabilized at an average of 298 units (P34-P35), signaling the end of the primary autumn tailoring surge.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The product experienced a significant autumn peak peaking at 612 units in P33 (late September). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: We are in late October (2019/10/21). Historically, for workwear like a fitted blazer, demand cools after the primary back-to-office/early-autumn surge but maintains a base level for indoor office use. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand has stabilized remarkably over the last three periods (P34: 313, P35: 283, P36: 282), averaging 293 units. The last two periods are almost identical (283 vs 282), indicating a very stable secondary plateau following the late-September peak. (4) Final forecast logic: Given the stability over the last two weeks and the absence of major late-October retail holidays until November, I expect demand to remain very close to this current maintenance level of ~280 units.

LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major autumn peak (P33: 612 units) followed by a stabilization period. Since P34, demand has transitioned into a steady plateau, fluctuating within a narrow range between 282 and 313 units. The average for the last four periods (P34-P37) is approximately 298 units. Given the late October date (2019/10/28), the market is in a post-peak maintenance phase for autumn tailoring before the seasonal transition to winter wear. Recent trend analysis suggests demand is holding steady around the 300-unit mark, with Period 37 showing a slight uptick to 313. The forecast anticipates continued stability within this current regime.

Historical analysis shows a post-peak stabilization following the September surge (P34-P36 avg: 293). Recent data indicates a significant upward trend in late October: Period 37 (313) and Period 38 (385). This 23% week-on-week increase moving into early November suggests a new demand driver, likely early-season holiday shopping or transition into winter formal wear. Given the momentum from 313 to 385, I anticipate demand will continue to rise as we approach the mid-November retail window, though slightly tempered from the previous jump.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major autumn peak which peaked in Period 33 (612 units). Following this peak, a new demand plateau of approximately 300 units was established (Periods 34-37). Period 38 saw a temporary spike to 385, followed by a sharp correction to 231 in Period 39 (early November). Period 40 falls on November 11th (Singles' Day), a significant retail date that often triggers promotional activity and a temporary bump in demand. While the overall trend for fitted blazers naturally cools as winter approaches, the calendar effect of mid-November sales events is expected to pull demand upward from the Period 39 low, though likely remaining below the 300-unit autumn plateau. Forecast logic: Apply a moderate recovery factor to the Period 39 trough to account for mid-November retail activity.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a post-peak stabilization following the September tailoring surge. Recent demand for late October and early November (Periods 37-40) has averaged approximately 301 units, despite a brief spike in Period 38 (385) and a subsequent dip in Period 39 (231). As of Period 40 (Nov 11), demand recovered slightly to 278 units. The current date (Nov 18) marks the week preceding Black Friday (Nov 29). Typically, in retail, demand for apparel either softens slightly as consumers anticipate sales or begins to rise due to early holiday promotions. Given the blazer's role in 'dressed' and 'workwear' categories, demand is expected to remain firm but stable near the recent 4-period mean, though likely showing a conservative uptick as the market enters the peak holiday shopping window.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn demand stabilization: Demand has converged to an average of ~300 units over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), maintaining a new baseline approximately 40% higher than early spring levels despite the passing of the primary September peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the late-autumn stabilization around 300 units, demand in the most recent three periods (P39-P41) has moderated to an average of 251 units, suggesting a slight seasonal cooling in mid-November. However, Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional week. In the context of this product's performance\u2014specifically the massive spike in September (P33) and the high baseline for autumn tailoring\u2014a significant promotional lift is expected. I am forecasting a 40% increase over the recent three-period average (251) to account for holiday-season promotional volume.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant regime change in Period 42 (Nov 25), with demand soaring to 733 units. This spike coincides with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, which is a major retail event. In Period 41, demand was 245 units, following a stable Late-Autumn average of approximately 300 units (P34-P40). Period 43 (Dec 2) represents the post-Black Friday period. Historically, demand following such a promotional peak usually experiences a 'hangover' or a sharp correction back toward the recent baseline as immediate holiday shopping appetites are satiated. Given the baseline established in Period 41 and the preceding weeks, the forecast expects demand to return near the 300-unit stabilized level, while potentially retaining some residual holiday momentum.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand surged to 733 units (+150% over the P34-P41 baseline), marking the highest peak in the product's history and surpassing the September seasonal peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in a post-Black Friday correction phase. Period 42 saw a record peak of 733 units, followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 to 169 units, which is significantly below the late-autumn baseline of approximately 290\u2013300 units (observed in Periods 34-41). This 'hangover' effect is common after major promotional events. For Period 44 (Dec 9), I expect a partial recovery toward the established baseline as the exhaustion of the sale period fades, but demand is unlikely to fully return to 300+ units as the peak season for autumn tailoring begins to wind down ahead of the holiday break. I predict a moderate increase from the Period 43 trough.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows that after the Black Friday surge (Period 42: 733 units) and subsequent crash (Period 43: 169 units), demand returned to its late-autumn baseline of approximately 300 units in Period 44 (304 units). The current period (Period 45, starting Dec 16) is the final full shopping week before Christmas. For a tailored dressy blazer, this typically involves a pre-holiday maintenance level or a slight increase due to partywear needs, but historical evidence for this product suggests a stable regime around ~300. Given the stability of Period 44 relative to the long-term baseline established in Period 41 (~300 units), I expect demand to remain consistent with this level before the holiday slowdown.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a late-autumn baseline of approximately 250-300 units following the Black Friday volatility (P42: 733, P43: 169). Period 44 (304) and Period 45 (258) confirm this stabilization. The current period (P46) covers December 23rd to December 29th. This week typically experiences a bifurcated demand pattern: a lull in the days immediately preceding and including Christmas Day, followed by a surge in 'After-Christmas' sales and preparations for New Year's Eve events. Given that this is a 'dressed' blazer, it is likely to benefit from end-of-year clearance traffic. However, the closure of businesses and reduced shopping days mid-week often temper the total weekly volume. I expect demand to remain slightly below the recent 300-unit average but consistent with the cooling trend observed in Period 45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for the Mariette Blazer: peak demand during autumn back-to-office cycles (Sept avg ~340) and significant promotional spikes (Black Friday, P42: 733). Following the Black Friday surge, demand stabilized briefly in early December (P44-P45 avg: 281) before dropping sharply in Period 46 (128 units) due to the Christmas holiday lull. The current period (P47, Dec 30 - Jan 5) covers the New Year transition. Typically, demand for workwear begins a modest recovery during the first week of January as consumers prepare for a return to professional environments and the commencement of winter clearance sales. Based on the previous trough of 128 and historical transition periods, I forecast a slight rebound towards the early spring baseline.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility confirmed: Demand dropped 50% during the Christmas week (P46) relative to the early December baseline, establishing a seasonal trough similar to mid-summer levels.
