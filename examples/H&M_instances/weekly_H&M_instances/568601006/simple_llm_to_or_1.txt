SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The provided training data [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows a mean of 173.4 with a slight upward trend in the latter half. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The current date is February 11, 2019. For a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this corresponds to the start of the Spring/Pre-Spring retail season. Demand for professional and structured tailoring typically rises as consumers update their wardrobes for the new season and return to office routines post-winter. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: The last three observations (179, 196, 186) are consistently above the initial two, suggesting a baseline shift towards the 180-190 range. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the transition into February (a key shopping month for spring tailoring) and the upward momentum in the recent window, I expect demand to remain strong and slightly exceed the late-period average.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (5 periods) showed an average demand of 173.4 units with a slight upward trend. However, Period 1 (the first test period) saw a significant jump to 227 units, representing a 31% increase over the previous average. The current date (Feb 18) marks the beginning of the spring transition for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' categories, where demand for blazers typically accelerates as consumers update workwear and event wardrobes for the new season. Given the strong momentum in Period 1 and the seasonal suitability of the Mariette Blazer, I expect demand to remain elevated near the new baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data (prior to Period 1) showed a mean of 173.4 units (stdev ~20). 2. Recent Trend: Since testing began, demand has surged significantly (227 in P1, 284 in P2). This represents a jump of ~31% and then ~25% week-over-week, clearly exceeding the previous training range. 3. Seasonal/Product Analysis: The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer. Late February marks the transition toward Spring/Summer collections and 'back-to-office' or 'Spring event' shopping, explaining the upward momentum. 4. Logic: The trend is sharply upward. Given the jump from 227 to 284 (+57 units), I expect demand to continue rising as the season peaks, though perhaps at a slightly decelerating pace as it stabilizes at this new level. I forecast 320 units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: Initial demand in the training/test phase shows significant volatility with values ranging from 145 to 284. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The date March 4th marks the transition into peak Spring fashion season. As a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, this item is highly relevant for both professional wardrobes and 'dressed' casual looks during early Spring. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand spiked in Period 2 (284) before cooling in Period 3 (198). However, the average of the last three periods (236) is significantly higher than the training average (~173). (4) Final forecast logic: Anticipating a seasonal uptick as March begins, I expect demand to rebound from the Period 3 dip but remain below the Period 2 peak, centering the forecast around the recent average to account for sustained higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: Average demand increased from training levels (~173) to approximately 236 (+36%) coinciding with the Spring fashion season launch.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Analysis: The training data (Periods -4 to 0) showed an average demand of 173.4 units. 2. Recent Trend: In the test phase (Periods 1-4), the average demand increased to 230.75 units, confirming a demand regime shift likely linked to the spring season. However, there is high volatility (range 198-284) and a cooling trend over the last two weeks (284 -> 198 -> 214). 3. Seasonal/Calendar Factors: The current date is March 11, moving deeper into the spring retail season. Blazers are highly relevant for the 'Office/Back-to-Work' and 'Transition' seasonal updates in March. 4. Forecast Logic: I expect demand to stabilize around the new regime mean (~230). Period 4 (214) showed a slight recovery from Period 3 (198). Given the season, a moderate forecast between the recent low and the regime average is appropriate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data averaged ~173 units. 2. Test Phase Analysis: Since entering the Spring season (Feb/Mar), demand shifted upwards. The test period average is 227.6. 3. Recent Trend: After a sharp peak in Period 2 (284), demand stabilized over the last three periods (198, 214, 215), averaging 209. 4. Calendar Logic: Late March is prime season for women's tailoring/blazers as weather warms and professional/holiday events increase. I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase from last week's 215. A forecast of 222 accounts for this seasonal resilience.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173, while the test phase (P1-P6) shows a higher average of ~226, confirming the carry-over insight of a seasonal regime shift. Interest in the 'Dressed' category (Blazers) remains high during the Spring season. Recent demand has shown extreme stability, holding at 214-215 units over the last three periods (P4-P6). Period 7 (March 25) coincides with the end of the month, which typically sees a slight lift due to payday cycles. Therefore, I forecast a slight increase from the current baseline of 215 to 223.

Daily Reward (R_t): $675.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 173 units. Following the Spring launch in Period 1, demand increased to an average of 236 units (Periods 1-4). However, the most recent four periods (Periods 4-7) show a stabilizing and slightly declining trend with observations of 214, 215, 215, and 186. The current date is April 1st, 2019. While early April often sees a 'Spring break' or 'Easter preparation' lift in professional attire like blazers, the drop to 186 in Period 7 suggests the initial seasonal surge has cooled. I anticipate a minor stabilization or slight recovery as shoppers prepare for mid-spring events, likely landing between the recent low (186) and the previous stable mean (215).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: The post-launch surge has moderated from an average of ~236 to a new baseline of ~200-210 over the last 4 periods (Periods 4-7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~173. Following the Spring launch in Period 1, demand peaked and then stabilized. Periods 4-7 showed a stable baseline averaging ~207 units. Period 8 (2019/4/1) saw a sharp increase to 249 units, which aligns with early April shopping and the buildup to Easter (April 21, 2019). The current date (April 8) is two weeks before Easter Sunday, a peak period for 'Dressed' products like the Mariette Blazer as customers purchase outfits for spring holidays and events. I expect the demand to remain elevated or slightly increase from the previous week's level due to this seasonal momentum.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a moderate baseline of ~173, increasing to a seasonal peak around Period 2 (284) due to the Spring launch. Since then, the demand has fluctuated around a stabilized average of approximately 205. Specifically, the last four periods (Periods 6-9) have averaged 207 units (215, 186, 249, 178). Date April 15th, 2019, places us in the heart of the Spring retail season for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' categories. Period 8 (249 units) likely captured a pre-Easter surge, while Period 9 (178 units) saw a typical post-spike drop. For Period 10, demand is expected to regress back toward the established post-launch baseline of ~205-210 given the lack of upcoming major retail holidays in the immediate following week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. Since the test phase began (Period 1), demand initially surged to an average of ~236 (Periods 1-3), then stabilized around 200-210 (Periods 4-7). However, the most recent three weeks (Periods 8-10) show a significant decline: 249 (likely a localized peak), followed by 178 and then 130. The date of Period 11 is April 22nd, 2019, which is Easter Monday. Retail demand often dips significantly during and immediately following the Easter holiday weekend as the initial Spring shopping peak subsides and consumers focus on holiday travel/activities. The sharp drop to 130 in Period 10 suggests a transition out of the peak Spring season. I anticipate demand will remain low, potentially rebounding slightly from the holiday dip but staying below the previous 200 baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand has decreased from the mid-season baseline of ~210 to approximately 154 (-27%) over the last two periods (9-10), indicating the end of the Spring peak for this blazer.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trajectory as the peak Spring season for the 'Mariette Blazer' (a professional/dressed garment) concludes. The demand regime shifted significantly in Period 9, dropping from a previous baseline of ~210 units to an average of ~145 units over the last three periods (Periods 9-11). Specifically, the last two observations (130 and 127) suggest the demand is settling into a lower, stable late-Spring floor. Given the current date (April 29), there are no major retail holidays acting as immediate catalysts for a spike. Therefore, the forecast assumes a continuation of this lower-level baseline, slightly adjusted for the very recent stability around 127-130 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: Average demand has transitioned from the high-season baseline of ~210 to a lower late-Spring baseline of ~145 (+/- 15 units) over the last 3 periods (Periods 9-11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer peaked during the Spring season launch (Feb-Mar) with averages around 210-230. A notable decline occurred in mid-April (Periods 10-11) as demand dropped to ~130 units. Period 12 (Apr 29) showed a sharp recovery to 191 units, likely driven by late-Spring shopping or pre-May holiday demand. However, looking at the broader trend for May (Period 13), tailoring units often see a secondary peak for early summer social events (weddings, graduations), but stay below the initial Spring launch peak. The jump from 127 to 191 is significant (+50%); a slight mean reversion is expected after a surge, but the baseline has clearly recovered from the April lows. I forecast demand to settle between the recent high and the previous lower baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer (Mariette Blazer) showed a high-season peak in February-March followed by a stabilization around 200 units. Since Period 9 (early April), there has been a noticeable shift to a lower demand regime as the primary Spring selling season for heavier tailored blazers winds down. Period 12 saw a spike to 191 units, likely due to late-April/early-May promotions or events (e.g., pre-summer graduation/wedding season), but Period 13 immediately regressed to 160 units. The current date is mid-May, typically a transitional period before Summer clearance. Given the recent average (Periods 9-13) of approx 157 units and the most recent observation of 160, I expect demand to remain within this late-Spring baseline range of 145-165 units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer (SKU 568601006) showed a high-season peak in February/March (averaging ~230) followed by a decline in April (averaging ~145). However, a new upward trend has emerged in the last three periods (Periods 12-14: 191, 160, 196), with the average rising to approximately 182 units. The current date (May 20) aligns with late Spring/early Summer, where demand for tailored 'dressed' items like this blazer often sees a secondary lift for events such as graduations or professional transitions. Given the recent climb from the 130-range back toward the 190s, I anticipate demand will sustain this higher level near the 185-200 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Recovery from late-Spring low; average demand increased from ~145 to ~182 (+25%) over the last 3 periods (12-14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer has shown significant volatility throughout the Spring season. Following a recovery phase where demand averaged ~182 units (Periods 12-14), the most recent period (Period 15) dropped to 143 units. Analysis of the late-May timeframe (May 27) suggests a transition period: while it is the end of the traditional Spring retail peak, the product remains seasonally relevant. However, the drop in Period 15, combined with previous low-demand regimes in late April/early May (Periods 10-11 averaged ~128), suggests demand is settling into a lower stabilization zone. The forecast weights the recent average of the last 4 periods (~172) against the immediate drop to 143, expecting a slight mean reversion as the season transitions into June.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a volatile but distinct seasonal pattern. After a peak in early Spring (Period 2-8), demand settled into a lower baseline. Most recently, following a recovery phase (Periods 12-14 averaging ~182), the last two periods (15-16) have seen a slight cooling, averaging 155.5 units. The Current Date of 2019/6/3 places the product in the very early summer/post-Spring tailoring season. Given the recent demand of 168 (Period 16) and 143 (Period 15), the product seems to be stabilizing around a late-season mean of approximately 160-170 units. There are no major retail holidays in early June to suggest a significant spike, though the blazer remains a staple item. I will forecast a slight reversion to the recent weighted average.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand analysis shows a significant cooling of interest. While Periods 12-14 showed a 'recovery' average of ~182, the last three periods (15-17) have seen demand drop to an average of 143 (143, 168, 118). Specifically, the drop to 118 in Period 17 (June 3rd) suggests a seasonal transition away from lined blazers as summer begins. Given the volatility but clear downward pressure, I anticipate demand will remain in this lower regime, slightly rebounding from the P17 dip but staying well below the mid-season averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: The previously noted recovery (Avg ~182) has dissipated; demand has returned to a lower baseline of ~143 (-21%) over the last 3 periods (15-17), likely due to seasonal summer decline for lined outerwear.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a fluctuating but generally declining trend as we move into the peak of summer (June). Specifically, the last four periods (15-18) recorded demands of 143, 168, 118, and 139, resulting in an average of 142 units. This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 18 suggesting a lower summer baseline for this lined blazer (~143). Given the current date is mid-June (2019/06/17), demand for a 'fitted jacket in woven fabric' is expected to remain low as consumer preference shifts toward lighter, unlined summer apparel. Recent volatility suggests a range between 120-140 is likely; weighting the most recent observation (Period 18: 139) against the four-period average (142), I forecast a continuation of this low-season baseline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) has shown a clear downward trajectory as the season moves into mid-summer. Recent demand (Periods 17-19) has averaged 126 units (118, 139, 122), compared to the prior three-period average of 145. The Carry-over insight from Period 18 correctly identified a shift to a lower baseline (~143). Given the product is a 'fitted jacket in woven fabric' with lining, it is less seasonally relevant in late June (Current Date: 2019/6/24) due to rising temperatures. The most recent observation (122) suggests the demand is stabilizing at the lower end of the current regime (roughly 120-140 units). I forecast a slight stabilization/minor decline for Period 20.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend as we enter mid-summer (July 1st). The Mariette Blazer is a lined, fitted jacket, which typically experiences lower demand during peak summer temperatures. Recent demand over the last four periods has shown a steady decline: 118, 139, 122, and a sharp drop to 73 in Period 20. This indicates a significant cooling of interest. The average of the last three periods is approximately 111, but the most recent figure of 73 suggests a momentum-based drop or a clearing of summer sales. For Period 21, I anticipate demand will remain at this lower summer baseline, slightly recovering from the localized trough of Period 20 but remaining significantly below the previous mid-season averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Demand has entered a mid-summer trough, dropping from the previous baseline of ~143 down to an average of ~98 (-31%) over the last two periods, reflecting low seasonal relevance for lined tailoring in July.

Historical demand for the last three periods (19, 20, 21) shows values of 122, 73, and 116, averaging 103.6 units. This is a significant drop from the late-spring baseline of ~143. Period 20 (73 units) appears to be the lowest point, with Period 21 showing a slight recovery to 116. Given the date (July 8th), we are in the peak of summer heat where demand for 'lined woven jackets' typically remains at its seasonal nadir. I expect demand to remain within this newly established lower range (~100 units), potentially stabilizing or slightly improving as we move away from the initial July drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: Average demand has settled into a mid-summer trough of approximately 104 units (-27% vs previous period 15-18 average of 142), reflecting seasonally low demand for lined tailoring in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern shows the Mariette Blazer, a lined tailored item, experienced high demand in early Spring (~200+ units), followed by a steady decline as temperatures rise. (2) Calendar context: We are currently in mid-July (2019/7/15), which is the height of the summer season where demand for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Lined' jackets typically remains at a seasonal low. (3) Recent trend: After hitting a trough of 73 in Period 20, demand in the last two periods has stabilized slightly higher at 116 and 120. (4) Forecast logic: The average of the last three periods (19-22) is roughly 108. With the most recent two points being 116 and 120, there is a slight upward correction from the extreme low of late June, but no major seasonal catalyst exists yet for a significant breakout. I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' (lined tailoring) has transitioned from a high-spring baseline (~210) to a summer trough. Previous carry-over insights identified a regime shift at Period 19, establishing a mid-summer baseline of approximately 104 units. Recent data (Periods 21-23) shows a consistent stabilization around this new level: 116, 120, and 120. Period 20 (73) is treated as a temporary outlier. Given the current date (July 22), the product remains in a seasonally slow period for lined outerwear. Demand has been remarkably stable at exactly 120 units for the last two weeks, suggesting a settled baseline. I will forecast a continuation of this stable trough demand at 119, reflecting the established mid-July pattern.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lined blazer (SKU 568601006) has shown a clear seasonal decline into the mid-summer period. The 'Carry-over Insights' previously identified a mid-summer trough around Period 19, with demand averaging approximately 104 units. Looking at the most recent four periods (21-24), the actual demand values are [116, 120, 120, 63], yielding an average of ~105. However, the last observed period (Period 24, July 22) shows a significant drop to 63, which often occurs at the end of a clearance cycle or peak summer heat. Given the date (July 29), we are at the tail end of the summer trough before any potential early-autumn restock or pre-fall interest. While the average is ~100, the recent volatility (63 units) suggests a bearish outlook for the final week of July. I will forecast a slight recovery from the Period 24 low but remain within the established summer trough range.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this lined blazer (SKU 568601006) has been in a sustained mid-summer trough since Period 19, confirmed by Carry-Over Insights. Recent demand for Periods 20-25 shows a volatile but low average of approximately 98 units (73, 116, 120, 120, 63, 94). The current date (August 5) represents the very beginning of the transition into late summer and early pre-fall. While 'Back to School' and early autumn professional shopping typically begin in August, demand for tailored blazers usually sees a delayed recovery compared to lighter summer items. The last two weeks saw a significant dip to 63 followed by a partial recovery to 94. Given the volatility (SD is relatively high) and the fact that we are still in early August, I expect demand to remain well below the Spring baseline of 180+ but potentially show a slight upward movement as the summer sale ends and new-season interest begins. I will forecast a value reflecting the recent average of the established trough.

Historical demand analysis shows a mid-summer trough between Periods 19 and 25, where demand averaged approximately 101 units. Period 26 (Aug 5) shows a significant upward movement to 146 units, a 55% increase over the previous week. This shift aligns with the typical retail calendar transition where demand for lined tailoring and blazers begins to recover in mid-August due to 'Back to Office' and 'Pre-Fall' shopping. Given this seasonal momentum and the sharp jump in the most recent period, I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory as we approach the end of summer.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear mid-summer trough from Periods 19-25 where demand averaged ~101 units. However, we have observed a significant inflection point starting Period 26 (146 units) and accelerating sharply in Period 27 (301 units). This aligns perfectly with the retail calendar for a 'lined blazer' as customers transition into the 'Back to Work' and Autumn fashion season in mid-to-late August. The demand of 301 is the highest recorded in the dataset, surpassing the Spring launch peaks (e.g., 284 in Period 2). While the growth is aggressive, such spikes are common during seasonal transitions for core tailoring items. For Period 28, I expect demand to remain at this high seasonal plateau or experience a slight consolidation as the initial shopping surge stabilizes, but remains significantly above the summer baseline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows this SKU (Mariette Blazer) experienced a mid-summer trough from Periods 19-25 with an average demand of approximately 101 units. However, starting Period 26 (early August), demand began a sharp upward trajectory (146, 301, 251), signaling a regime shift. This aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' and 'Pre-Fall' retail season where demand for dressed tailoring (blazers) typically surges as consumers return to work and school. While Period 27 hit a peak of 301, Period 28 showed a slight correction to 251. Given the current date (Aug 26), we are entering the peak of the Fall transition. I expect demand to remain high but potentially stabilize slightly below the initial surge peak. Predicting a value similar to the most recent period to account for sustained Fall interest.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Post-summer recovery confirmed. Average demand increased from ~100 to ~233 (+133%) over the last 3 periods (26-28), driven by seasonal demand for Fall tailoring/back-to-work shopping.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU follows strong seasonal patterns. After a mid-summer trough (Periods 19-25, avg ~100), demand shifted into a 'Back-to-Work' / Fall fashion regime starting Period 26 (avg ~232). The last three periods (27, 28, 29) recorded demands of 301, 251, and 231 respectively. While there is a slight downward taper from the initial peak of 301, the current level remains high and stable as we enter early September (2019/9/2), a peak period for women's tailoring. Given the average of the last three periods is approximately 261, but the most recent trend is a consolidation toward the 230-250 range, I expect demand to remain consistent with late August performance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant shift in demand starting from Period 26 (August), moving from a summer trough (~100 units) to a high-demand regime for Fall tailoring. The demand over the last 5 periods (26-30) has averaged 257 units, a substantial increase (+157%) from the summer baseline. The most recent observation (Period 30) reached a peak of 357 units, which aligns with early September 'back-to-work' and 'back-to-school' shopping peaks for formal wear like the Mariette Blazer. Given the date (Sept 9), we are currently in the peak seasonal window for this category. While Period 30 was exceptionally high, the trend remains strong but likely stabilized near this peak level. I will forecast a slight moderation from the peak of 357 but stay well above the 250 average to reflect continued seasonal momentum.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: Short-term peak in early September (357 units) aligns with seasonal 'back-to-work' demand; current regime average (Periods 27-30) has risen to ~285 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-activity regime synonymous with the Fall 'back-to-work' season. Historical demand in the previous four periods (28 to 31) has averaged 291.7 units, a significant jump from the summer trough (~100 units). Demand peaked in Period 30 (357) and remained strong in Period 31 (328), though it shows a slight week-over-week cooling of 8% suggesting the initial peak of the season has been reached. For Period 32 (mid-September), I expect demand to remain elevated but continue a slight downward stabilization towards the current regime average as the primary September shopping surge settles.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 27 (mid-August) as the product entered the Fall/back-to-work season. In the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has reached a high-plateau phase, averaging approximately 342 units (357, 328, 341). This represents a sustained peak compared to the training average of ~170 and the summer trough of ~100. Current date 2019/09/23 is late September, which typically remains a strong period for women's tailoring (blazers) as weather cools and professional wardrobes are refreshed. Given the stability of the last three periods (varying by less than 5%), I expect demand to remain in this elevated range before any potential late-autumn cooling.

Carry-over insight: High-season peak confirmed at Period 32: Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime (Avg ~342) for the last 3 periods (P30-P32), reflecting peak Fall tailoring demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a high-volume regime in September, with demand averaging approximately 342 units between Periods 30-32. Period 33 exhibited a massive spike to 612 units (+80% above the recent average), which likely represents a specific promotional event or a month-end/pay-day surge typical of late September. As we move into October (Period 34), I anticipate a mean reversion toward the established high-season baseline rather than a continuation of the 600+ level, though demand should remain elevated due to the product's seasonal relevance (lined tailoring for Fall). I forecast a correction back to the high-regime average with a slight downward adjustment from the spike.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility at Period 33: A single-period spike to 612 units was observed, deviating +80% from the previous 3-period average (~342). While the high-season regime is confirmed, Period 33 represents a likely outlier or event-driven peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern for the 'Mariette Blazer', with a significant 'back-to-work' surge beginning in August (Period 27). After a high-season stabilization period (P30-P32) averaging ~342 units, a massive outlier or event-driven spike occurred in Period 33 (612 units). Period 34 (313 units) shows a return to the established high-season regime, aligning closely with the average demand observed across Periods 30-32. As we are now in early October, demand is expected to remain firm within this high-volume Fall tailoring regime but without the outlier intensity of Period 33. The forecast is based on the recent stable average excluding the outlier.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the extreme outlier in Period 33 (612 units), the demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a clear cooling phase as the 'back-to-work' seasonal peak of September subsides. Periods 34 (313) and 35 (283) show a consecutive decline from the previous stable average of approximately 342 units observed in early September. This downward trajectory reflects a seasonal transition in mid-October where consumer interest often shifts from blazers towards heavier winter outerwear. For Period 36, I expect a continued moderate decline as the market moves further away from the peak tailoring season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal progression: a mid-summer trough (~100 units) followed by a strong 'back-to-work' recovery in August/September that peaked in late September. Period 33 was an extreme outlier (612 units). Since that peak, the demand has stabilized into a late-Fall regime. For the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has settled at 313, 283, and 282 units respectively, averaging approximately 293 units. The current date (Oct 21) is past the initial Fall surge but remains within the window for dressed tailoring/office wear. Given the very consistent demand over the last two weeks (283 and 282), I expect the demand to remain stable near this new baseline, though perhaps slightly softening as the primary shopping window for mid-weight blazers begins to transition toward heavier winter outerwear.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at Period 36: Following the volatile September peak (P33), demand has settled into a late-Fall baseline of approximately 283 units (Avg of last 3 periods: 293). This represents a -17% step down from the P30-P32 high-season average (~342).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has transitioned from its early Autumn high-season peak (~342 units in September) to a more stable late-Autumn baseline as noted in the Carry-Over Insights. Recent demand for the last three periods (P35-P37) shows high consistency with values of 283, 282, and 313, resulting in an average of 293 units. This suggests that while the initial 'back-to-work' surge has subsided, the product maintains strong relevance for the 'Dressed' wardrobe category in late October. The slight uptick in Period 37 (313) could be a minor precursor to the upcoming promotional season, but it is more likely within the standard variance of the current 280-300 unit regime. I am forecasting a slight normalization back toward the 290-300 range.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer underwent a significant recovery in late August/September (Avg ~342) before stabilizing in October at approximately 283 units. However, demand in the most recent two periods has surged again, moving from 282 to 313 (+11%) and then to 385 (+23%) in Period 38 (Oct 28). This upward momentum entering early November suggests the start of a late-autumn/pre-holiday lift for tailored outerwear. The forecast anticipates continued high demand reaching a peak near the 400-unit level as seasonal shopping for the holiday season begins and cold-weather tailoring remains relevant.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand has broken out of the late-Fall baseline (~283) with two consecutive increases reaching 385 units, signaling a potential holiday season lift for tailored jackets.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a sequence of regime shifts: back-to-work peak (P30-P32, avg ~342), followed by a stabilization phase (P34-P37, avg ~298). A brief uptick in P38 (385) suggested a holiday breakout, but P39 demand fell sharply to 231 units (-40% WoW). This drop in Period 39 (early November) significantly disrupts the 'holiday breakout' theory noted in the P39 carry-over insight. Given the current date (Nov 11), we are likely seeing a pre-Black Friday lull where consumers defer spending. The forecast for Period 40 anticipates a slight recovery from the P39 dip as we approach the promotional window, but remains below the late-Fall baseline (~283) due to the recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong upward trend in late October (P38: 385 units) likely driven by holiday preparation, followed by a correction in early November (P39: 231 units). Demand recovered in P40 (278 units) as the market moves closer to peak holiday shopping. Current date is Nov 18, which is the week leading into the Black Friday shopping window. For a versatile 'Dressed' blazer like the Mariette, this period usually sees a significant lift in demand due to shoppers looking for holiday event outfits and early gift-giving/promotional interest. I expect demand to rise from the P40 level towards the high-300s, consistent with the breakout observed in late October, as seasonal demand intensity increases.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a late-Fall/Pre-Holiday phase. Historically, the 'back-to-work' peak occurred in September (avg ~342), followed by a stabilization around 280-300 units in October. Recent periods (P39-P41) show demand levels of 231, 278, and 245 (avg ~251), indicating a slight softening compared to the October average (~293) and the briefly suspected breakout in P38. Period 42 (Nov 25) coincides with the week of Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019. Retail knowledge suggests a significant spike for dressed tailoring and lined blazers during the holiday promotional window and lead-up to winter holiday events. Given the 3-period baseline of ~251 and the anticipated jump from major promotional events, the forecast projects a substantial increase similar in magnitude to the early-Fall peak, though tempered by the recent softening trend.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed at Period 42: Demand is expected to rise from the late-November baseline (~251) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions and holiday seasonal shopping.

(2) Historically, demand for fashion items drops significantly immediately following the Cyber Monday peak as promotions expire and the initial wave of gift shopping saturates. (3) The current date is Dec 2, 2019, which marks the start of a post-promotion cooling period before the final Christmas rush. (4) Comparing the recent surge (733) to the pre-holiday baseline (~251), I expect demand to revert toward the previous late-Fall average but remain slightly elevated due to ongoing holiday season relevance. Logic: 733 -> ~300-350 range.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed at Period 42: A significant spike to 733 units (+192% vs the previous 3-period average of ~251) occurred during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week, marking the highest demand point for this SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the extreme demand spike in Period 42 (733 units) associated with Black Friday/Cyber Monday, Period 43 saw a sharp 'post-promotion' correction to 169 units. Historically, this SKU maintained a baseline average of approximately 251 units (Periods 39-41) just before the holiday surge. Period 44 (Dec 9) represents a mid-December period where demand typically begins to recover from the post-sale slump as consumers shop for holiday parties and final seasonal gifts (given the 'Dressed/Tailoring' category). I expect demand to pull back upward from the Period 43 low toward the previous steady-state baseline, though it may remain slightly dampened due to the pull-forward of demand from the late-November sales event.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant holiday peak at Period 42 (733 units) followed by a sharp post-promotional correction in Period 43 (169 units). Period 44 (304 units) demonstrated a strong recovery, aligning with the late-Fall/pre-holiday baseline of approximately 280-300 units established in Periods 34-37. For Period 45 (week of Dec 16), demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase as it represents the final peak shopping week for festive event-wear and Christmas gifting before the typical late-December holiday lull. Given the 304 units in P44 and the historical high-season performance, a forecast slightly above the recent baseline is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $862.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge during Black Friday (Period 42: 733), followed by a sharp normalization in early December. The last two periods (P44: 304, P45: 258) indicate a post-spike baseline averaging approximately 280 units. The current period (P46) falls on the week of December 23, 2019 (Christmas week). Retail demand for tailored garments like blazers typically sees a deceleration during the immediate Christmas to New Year transition as consumer focus shifts from apparel shopping to holiday festivities and travel. Given the drop from 304 to 258 in the previous week, a further moderate decline is expected as the holiday peak subsides before any potential end-of-year clearance activity.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday deceleration: Demand has declined from the early December baseline of ~280 units as of Period 45, reflecting the typical late-December retail slowdown.

Predicted demand: 215 units

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal cycle for this lined blazer, with clear peaks during back-to-work (Sept) and Black Friday (P42), followed by a pronounced late-December drop. The demand for Period 46 (128 units) reflects the typical post-holiday deceleration and seasonal shift away from tailoring during the winter holiday week. Period 47 (2019/12/30) falls on the week of New Year's, where consumer focus remains low for professional tailoring before the January return-to-work sentiment kicks in. Historically, after significant peaks and subsequent drops (like P24 or P20), demand tends to find a low-level floor before recovering. Given the drop from 258 to 128 last week, I expect demand to remain at a similar trough level or see a slight uplift from gift card redemptions/clearance, though it will likely stay well below the 200-unit mark until mid-January.
