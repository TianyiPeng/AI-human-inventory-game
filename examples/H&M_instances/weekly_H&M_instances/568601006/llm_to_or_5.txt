Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is a 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' item. This category typically sees stable to increasing demand during the transition from winter to spring as consumers refresh their office and professional wardrobe. The initial provided demand history for the last 5 periods (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) shows a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 20.3. There is a slight upward trend in the last three data points (179, 196, 186) compared to the first two. Given the promised lead time of 0, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this recent demand level while being responsive to the seasonal shift towards spring tailoring. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 (L=0). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is professional womenswear. Demand in Period 1 was 227 units, which is higher than the historical average of 173.4 units (samples: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186). Because the starting on-hand inventory was 0 and we ordered 191 units, all were sold, leaving us with 0 on-hand and missed demand of 36 units. The date (Feb 18) suggests a move into the spring professional season. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the small sample size, and maintain the promised lead time of 0 as confirmed by the Period 1 arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring piece. We are currently in late February (Period 3). Historical data showed early February demand around 170-180, but Periods 1 and 2 (Feb 11 and Feb 18) saw a significant surge to 227 and 284 respectively, likely due to 'back-to-office' or early spring professional wardrobe shopping. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory because demand exceeded our orders in both P1 and P2 (sold 100% of stock). Since the actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival), we need to set our base stock to cover the upcoming Period 3 demand. Given the upward trend (179 -> 196 -> 186 -> 227 -> 284), I will use the recent mean (all 5 samples: ~193, or just the 2 recent high-demand samples: ~255). To avoid stockouts seen in P1 and P2, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent growth while smoothing the spike. Sigma will also be based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1 (Feb 11): average demand increased from ~170 to ~255 (+50%) likely due to seasonal spring office wear demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand seasonal phase (Spring office wear). In Periods 1 and 2, stockouts occurred despite orders of 191 and 221 units, indicating true demand was likely higher than sales. In Period 3, demand was 198, but the average across the last three weeks is significantly higher than the initial historical mean of 173. The average demand for the last 3 periods is approx 236 ((227+284+198)/3). The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods based on the last three 'conclude' messages. To capture this elevated demand regime and mitigate stockout risk while accounting for the recent drop to 198, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to calibrate the OR backend to the current seasonal level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring), which typically sees increased demand during the spring season (February/March) for office wear. Since Period 1 (Feb 11), we have observed a significant demand shift. Historical demand was [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] (average ~173), while the recent 4 periods have been [227, 284, 198, 214] (average ~231), representing a 33% increase. The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. To address the current regime, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the spring office wear demand pattern. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility (roughly 37.5). On-hand inventory is 60, and there is no pipeline inventory, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the target base stock based on these parameters.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring piece. Data from Periods 1-5 (Feb 11 - Mar 11) confirms a stabilized demand regime significantly higher than the pre-game history. The average demand over the last 5 periods since the game start is 227.6 units, compared to the pre-game average of 173.4. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 48 units on hand and 0 in transit. To capture the current seasonal demand while accounting for recent volatility (demand has ranged from 198 to 284), I will use the recent 5-period average (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=5 focuses the OR engine on the post-shift regime observed in 'Carry-over Insights'. L remains at the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring), which typically sees increased demand during the spring transition (office wear refresh). Since Period 1 (Feb 11), demand has shifted from a pre-game average of ~172 to a higher regime. In the last 4 periods (P3-P6), demand has stabilized significantly with values [198, 214, 215, 215], yielding a mean of roughly 210.5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 6 recorded periods. To optimize inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this stable post-shift demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the low volatility observed in recent weeks. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it accurately reflects the 0-period lead time observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Period 3 (Late Feb) at a mean of ~210 units per period following the initial seasonal spring shift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in a stable demand regime after an initial seasonal spike in February. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 3 through 7), demand has stabilized with a mean of 205.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 13 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 in-transit. I will use the recent 5-period window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current and stable regime, ensuring the service level is maintained for this spring office-wear item.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in Period 9 (April 8). Historical demand since Period 3 has stabilized around a mean of ~210 units, following an early-season spike. The most recent demand (Period 8) was 249, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0) because the order size based on the previous stabilized mean was insufficient for the spike. As a women's blazer, April data typically reflects sustained demand for spring office wear. To prevent further lost sales while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for demand calculation based on the stable regime since Period 3 (N=6). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and reaction. I am setting a slightly more responsive N for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility seen in Period 8.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of the spring season (mid-April). Demand has been relatively stable since Period 3, fluctuating between ~180 and ~250 units. The most recent demand (Period 9) was 178, while Period 8 was 249. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The OR backend needs to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1) based on the stable regime identified in the carry-over insights. I will use the mean of the last 7 samples (Periods 3-9) to estimate mu_hat, as Period 3 marked the start of the stabilized demand regime. This avoids the high-variance noise from the very first two periods where demand spiked to 227 and 284 causing stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in Period 11 (Late April). Analysis of the historical demand from Period 3 onwards shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 213 units (average of periods 3-10). However, the last two periods (9 and 10) have shown a downward trend (178 and 130 units), which may indicate the end of the peak spring office wear season as we transition into warmer months. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the stable regime since Period 3 while allowing the more recent lower demand points to exert influence. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to reflect volatility in this specific regime. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during remaining spring demand against the potential for excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand signal suggests potential seasonal softening starting Period 10 (Apr 15): demand dropped to 130 after a multi-period average of ~210 (+/- 35% decrease).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered a new demand regime as of late April (Period 10), which aligns with the seasonal cooling of spring 'office wear' demand. For the first 9 periods, demand averaged ~210 units. However, Periods 10 and 11 have shown a significant drop to 130 and 127 respectively (a ~40% decrease). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for responsive ordering. To avoid excess inventory during this seasonal downturn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (Periods 9-11: 178, 130, 127) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining responsiveness. The lead time L is set to 'default' as actual lead time strictly matches promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 (Apr 15): Average demand decreased from ~210 to ~130 (-38%), confirmed by two consecutive periods of lower demand (130, 127).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand spiked back to 191 units from 130 and 127 in Periods 10 and 11, respectively. This suggests the previously identified 'downward shift' (labeled in Period 12 Carry-over Insights) was potentially a temporary dip rather than a sustained regime change, or that demand is significantly more volatile in May. The product is a Mariette Blazer (Women's Tailoring), which remains relevant throughout spring for professional wear. Total inventory ended at 0 in Period 12, leaving no cushion. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To adapt to the recent recovery in demand while respecting the variability of the last few periods (130, 127, 191), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent mean of ~150 units, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the higher variance observed during this transition from April into May. This ensures the OR backend raises the base stock enough to cover the recent bounce-back without over-reacting to the peak volumes of March.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound in Period 12 (May 6): Demand increased from ~130 to 191, indicating high volatility or a potential reversal of the late-April softening.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) has shown significant volatility in May. After a drop in April (avg ~130), demand rebounded in Period 12 (191) and settled at 160 in Period 13. Given the current date (May 13), we are in a late spring/early summer transition. The 'rebound' suggests the April dip was a temporary lull rather than a permanent downward trend. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered), I will focus on a recent demand window (N=4) to capture this post-April volatility which averages ~152 units (130, 127, 191, 160). This protects against the April lows while acknowledging the May recovery. L=0 is maintained based on consistent history. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to account for the high variance between 127 and 191 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $712.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (SKU 568601006) continues to show high volatility in May. Last period's demand was 196, following 160, 191, 127, and 130. The carry-over insights correctly identified a softening in late April (avg ~130), but May has seen a rebound with an average of approximately 182 units (191, 160, 196). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To handle the recent volatility and the demand rebound observed in May, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=5 for mu_hat captures the transition from the late-April dip to the current May levels, averaging approximately 161 (130+127+191+160+196 / 5). However, given the most recent demand of 196 and the zero inventory state, I will use N=3 to more aggressively weight the recent rebound (avg ~182), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents further stockouts while accounting for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound/stabilization confirmed in May: Average demand increased from ~130 (late April) to ~180 (May), characterized by higher volatility (standard deviation near 20).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a high-volatility regime following a demand rebound in May. Recent demands are [130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143]. The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around ~180 units in May (N=4: 191, 160, 196, 143; mean = 172.5). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since lead time is 0, the target base stock covers the current period's demand (L+1=1). With a high critical ratio (0.8), we need to ensure protection against the volatility observed in May (Std Dev \u2248 24). I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent May stabilization and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the current variance. This strategy balances the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 12 and 14 against the holding cost of units left over in Period 15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a late-spring/early-summer demand phase (Period 17, June 3). Historically, demand for this item has transitioned from a high spring peak (~210) to a more volatile but slightly lower range in May. Looking at the last four periods (P13-P16), demand has been [160, 196, 143, 168], averaging approximately 167 units. This indicates a stabilization around the mid-160s. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target cycle service level is 80%. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime from May onwards, ensuring we don't over-order based on the earlier March peak or under-order based on the brief late-April dip. Setting L to 'calculate' is safe as the observed lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in May/early June (Period 13-16) at an average of ~167 units per period, following high spring volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in Period 18 (June 10). Reviewing the historical demand for May and early June (Periods 13-17), demand has shown significant fluctuations with values of 160, 196, 143, 168, and 118. The average over these last 5 periods is 157.0 units. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 118, which is the lowest since the late-April softening, suggesting a possible summer seasonality dip as Blazers are typically a spring/autumn garment. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility (standard deviation ~29 over the last 5 periods) and the downward trend in the most recent week, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime while acknowledging the increased variance. Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the consistent 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late Q2; demand dropped to 118 in Period 17 (June 3), suggesting a possible summer seasonal slowdown for tailoring/blazers.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a fitted blazer (Womens Tailoring). Current date is mid-June, entering the summer trough. Historical demand has shown a clear downward trend since mid-May: P15 (143), P16 (168), P17 (118), P18 (139). The average over these last 4 periods is ~142, significantly lower than the May average of ~167 noted in carry-over insights. This confirms a summer seasonal slowdown for blazers. Actual lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower late-Q2 demand level while maintaining the actual lead time L=0. Sigma_hat is also calculated over recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility (~21). This approach limits ending inventory (holding cost $1.0) while covering the lower predicted demand, optimizing the service level for a profit of $4.0.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal slowdown confirmed for blazer SKU: Period 17-18 demand average fell to ~128 compared to ~167 in early May/June (-23%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a summer seasonal slowdown, confirmed by demand levels over the last three periods (118, 139, 122). The average demand for these three periods is 126.3, compared to the May/early June average of ~167. This represents a confirmed regime shift to a lower demand level. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility accurately. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will reflect using the default method. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units, and since there is 0 in-transit inventory, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order based on the new lowered demand parameters (1+L)*~126 while accounting for the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Period 17-19): Average demand stabilized at ~126 units, reflecting a permanent seasonal step-down for the blazer category in late Q2.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 begins on July 1st. The SKU (Mariette Blazer) is in a confirmed summer demand regime. Previous 'Carry-over Insights' identified a stabilization in demand starting around Period 17 (June 3), with the average demand for Period 17-20 being (118+139+122+73)/4 = 113. Period 20 demand (73) was significantly lower than the preceding three periods, potentially indicating a deeper July slowdown or just high volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this summer regime (Period 17-20). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous '0 periods' arrivals in the history. I am setting L to default (0). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock reflects the current ~113 average plus safety stock for the observed summer volatility, while accounting for the most recent demand dip.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 17-20) average demand is ~113. Period 20 (July context) showed a significant further drop to 73, suggesting a possible mid-summer trough.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Blazer) is currently in a summer seasonal demand regime. Period 21 demand (116) showed a recovery from the sharp mid-summer drop in Period 20 (73), but remains significantly lower than the spring/early summer averages (~167-210). The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 18-21) is approximately 112.5. Given the product context (tailored blazers in July), I expect demand to remain at this lower summer baseline until the late-summer/pre-fall transition begins in August. On-hand inventory is low (21 units), so a replenishment order is needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current summer regime (June/July) while excluding the higher May demand. This targets the ~113-115 unit mean. Sigma will also be calculated over the last 4 periods to reflect recent volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed for July: Demand recovered in Period 21 to 116 units after a sharp drop to 73 in Period 20. The current summer regime (Periods 18-21) average is ~113 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer demand regime. Following a mid-July trough (Period 20 demand: 73), demand has stabilized over the last two periods (Period 21: 116, Period 22: 120). The average demand since the onset of this summer slowdown (Period 17 onward) is approximately 114 units. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current regime more accurately (Periods 17-22), which covers the summer stabilization while minimizing the impact of the stronger spring demand. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for current moderate demand and high summer volatility, ensuring sufficient service levels without excessive holding costs as we approach late July.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed (Period 21-22): Demand has recovered from the mid-July trough (73) to a stable level around 118 units. The summer regime (Period 17-22) average is approximately 114 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized in the current summer regime (Periods 18-23) following a mid-July trough. The last three periods show consistent demand (116, 120, 120), indicating a very stable late-July pattern. Since Period 18, the demand hasn't exceeded 139, and the average for the last 6 periods is approximately 115 units. Given the consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stable summer demand regime (avg ~115). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower volatility compared to the high-variance spring periods. This approach maintains a lean inventory while ensuring sufficient stock for the steady summer sales.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime fully stabilized (Period 21-23): Demand has leveled at ~119 units per period (116, 120, 120) following the early July recovery.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has shown significant volatility in July. While periods 21-23 suggested stabilization around 119 units, Period 24 demand dropped sharply to 63 units. This mirrors the mid-summer drop seen in Period 20 (73 units), suggesting that late July/early August may be a period of erratic, low demand for women's tailoring. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this latest drop while acknowledging the previous baseline of ~119, I will use a recent_N of 4 periods (Periods 21-24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the high demand periods (116, 120, 120) and the recent low (63), providing a balanced but cautious forecast (Average: ~105) that protects against overstocking during this low-demand summer phase while maintaining service levels if demand recovers.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility confirmed: Demand dropped significantly in Period 24 (63 units) following a stable three-week period (~119 units), mirroring a similar drop in Period 20 (73 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a summer seasonal regime (starting around Period 17, approx. June), characterized by lower average demand and periodic dips (Period 20: 73, Period 24: 63). Period 25 demand was 94, showing a slight recovery from the Period 24 dip but remaining below the early summer average of ~114-119. Given the recurring sharp drops every 4-5 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering Periods 17-25) to capture this lower summer average of approx. 104 units while maintaining enough safety stock via sigma_hat to handle the volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (Period 17-25) average is approximately 104 units, inclusive of periodic sharp dips to the 60-70 range.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a summer demand regime with periodic volatility. Period 26 demand spiked to 146, which is significantly higher than the previous two periods (63, 94) and the summer average of approx. 104 units. This spike suggests a possible early August back-to-work or end-of-summer transition. We finished Period 26 with 0 inventory, meaning we stocked out. Given the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to rely on historical performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the summer volatility while acknowledging the recent upward trend. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to account for the high variance observed between mid-summer troughs (63) and recent spikes (146).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential late-summer demand recovery signaled by Period 26 demand spike (146), the highest since early May, following a period of mid-summer volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer spiked dramatically in Period 27 (301 units), following a high demand in Period 26 (146 units). This indicates a strong late-summer/pre-fall seasonal recovery, likely driven by 'back-to-office' or 'back-to-school' shopping which typically peaks in mid-to-late August. Historical averages from the summer (approx. 104-114) are no longer relevant. I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 to capture this immediate surge while acknowledging the high volatility (301 is a significant outlier compared to the rest of the year). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The goal is to set a high base stock to prevent stockouts during this potential 'Back-to-Business' peak, balancing against the risk of high holding costs if the spike is transient.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-Business seasonal spike confirmed (Period 27): Demand jumped to 301, the highest recorded value. This marks a definitive shift from the summer regime (avg ~104) to a high-volume pre-fall regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has clearly transitioned from a low-volume summer regime (avg ~104) to a high-volume 'Back-to-Business' fall regime starting in Period 27 (mid-August). Demand in Period 27 was 301 and Period 28 was 251. This represents a significant and sustained shift. To capture this new mean without under-ordering, I am selecting mu_hat using recent_N with N=2, focusing specifically on these two high-demand periods (average ~276). Given the lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine will use this as the base for the base-stock calculation. Period 28 concluded with 65 units on hand, which will be subtracted from the projected base stock level. High volatility is expected during seasonal transitions, so recent_N for sigma_hat is also set to 2 to reflect the recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime confirmed (Period 27-28): Average demand has shifted to ~276 units per period, a +165% increase from the summer average of ~104.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak 'Back-to-Business' fall season (September). Period 29 demand (231) confirms the high-volume regime established in Period 27-28. The 3-period average for this new regime (Periods 27, 28, 29) is 261 units. Given it is early September, demand is expected to remain high as seasonal tailoring sales typically peak now. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-volume shift while allowing the OR backend to calculate volatility from the same window. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the midst of a seasonal 'Back-to-Business' peak. Period 30 (Sep 2) saw demand spike to 357, the highest in the history of the game, following a period of already elevated demand (avg ~276). We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0) and have no units in-transit. The demand regime from Period 27-30 is significantly higher and more volatile than the summer period, with an average of ~285 units and a standard deviation reflecting large swings (301, 251, 231, 357). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this specific post-summer high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to satisfy the current peak and mitigate stockouts, especially considering the 80% service level target (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-Business peak intensified (Period 30): Demand reached a new high of 357; the regime from Period 27-30 average demand is ~285 units (+174% over summer average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1307.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak 'Back-to-Business' autumn regime as of September 16. The demand shift starting Period 27 has seen a significant increase to an average of ~294 units over the last 5 periods (301, 251, 231, 357, 328), with the most recent two weeks showing high-intensity peaks (357 and 328). Despite stockouts in Period 30, the lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this matured high-volume regime while acknowledging the recent intensity, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 27-31). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed during this peak period (std dev ~53). This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit, while holding enough stock for the sustained autumnal demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime intensity confirmed (Period 27-31): Average demand is ~294 units, but the last two periods (Period 30-31) show a higher sustained peak of ~342 units, suggesting the peak may be plateauing or still slightly rising.

Demand data from the last 6 periods (P27-P32) confirms a significant regime shift with demands of [301, 251, 231, 357, 328, 341]. The average for this entire fall regime is ~294, but the last three periods (P30-P32) specifically show a higher, more stable plateau with an average of ~342 units. Given the high stock-out risk (ending inventory was 0 in P30 and P32), I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the higher mean and variance of this new regime. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to satisfy the current high-velocity demand. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime (P27-P32) average demand is ~294 units. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) indicate a sustained peak plateau at ~342 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Blazer) is experiencing a massive seasonal volatility spike associated with the late-September peak of the 'Back-to-Business' fall season. Period 33 demand skyrocketed to 612 units, nearly double the previous plateau of ~340 units. This suggests the transition from a 'peak plateau' to a 'hyper-peak' phase. With on-hand inventory at 0, aggressive stocking is required to capture this demand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle this sudden near-doubling of demand, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 600 units (reflecting the most recent observation) to ensure the base stock calculation targets this new level. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=7, covering the fall regime) to capture the significantly increased volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak demand detected in late September (Period 33): Demand spiked to 612 units, a 108% increase over the previous Fall plateau average (~294).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a high-demand fall 'Back-to-Business' regime. Period 33 saw a hyper-peak demand of 612 units, which I responded to with a high order in Period 34 (707 units). Period 34 demand has returned to 313, which aligns more closely with the sustained fall plateau average of ~325 units observed across Periods 27-32 (excluding the hyper-peak outlier). The current on-hand inventory is 394 units. Given the 10/7/2019 date, we are likely past the initial September peak and entering a secondary fall demand level or a stabilization phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 (covering Periods 27-34) to capture the full fall regime average while smoothing the hyper-peak. This yields an average of ~340 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to account for the high volatility introduced by the outlier in Period 33. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-peak demand of 612 (Period 33) subsided in Period 34 (313), indicating the late-September spike was transitory. The fall 'Back-to-Business' regime (P27-P34) now maintains an average of ~330-340 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a Fall 'Back-to-Business' demand regime. After a massive 'hyper-peak' spike of 612 units in Period 33 (late September), demand has returned to a more stable but still elevated level (313 units in Period 34 and 283 units in Period 35). This suggests the peak season is plateauing or slightly softening. The average demand for the most recent two periods (after the outlier) is ~298 units, consistent with the broader Fall regime average of ~330-340 units identified in carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the entirety of the Fall regime (starting Period 27) while smoothing the Period 33 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=9 to reflect the significant increase in volatility during this high-volume period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime stabilized post-hyper-peak: Demand in Periods 34-35 (313, 283) indicates a post-spike plateau averaging ~298 units, returning to levels seen prior to the Period 33 outlier (612).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Blazer) is in the post-peak Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime. After the extreme hyper-peak in Period 33 (612 units), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (Periods 34-36) at an average of 293 units (313, 283, 282). This indicates the outlier has passed, and we are back to the high-sustained fall plateau identified earlier (~294-300 units). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-spike mean and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect the current period-to-period variability while ignoring the P33 outlier's noise. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime stability confirmed (P34-P36): Following the P33 hyper-peak, demand has stabilized at an average of ~293 units, consistent with the pre-spike plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. The 'Back-to-Business' Fall regime for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized following the late-September hyper-peak. Since the hyper-peak in Period 33 (612 units), demand has returned to a consistent plateau: Period 34 (313), Period 35 (283), Period 36 (282), and Period 37 (313). The average demand over these last four periods is approximately 298 units. The actual lead time remains 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders in the same period they are placed. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-peak stabilization and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect current volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current stable demand phase while avoiding over-stocking based on the transitory Period 33 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1252.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), which often sees sustained high demand for tailoring/blazers due to the continuation of the 'Back-to-Business' season and the start of holiday events. Recent demand in Period 38 (Oct 28) spiked to 385, which is notably higher than the established post-hyper-peak plateau average of ~293 (P34-P37). This suggests a potential November upward drift or high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) to capture the post-hyper-peak mean (~315) and volatility, which provides a safer buffer for the seasonal momentum seen in the latest datum while also accounting for the relatively high holding cost compared to profit ($1 vs $4).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Potential late-fall demand uptick observed in Period 38 (385 units), exceeding the previous post-peak plateau average of ~293 by 31%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $804.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in a Fall/Winter regime. Following a late-fall uptick (385 units) in Period 38, Period 39 demand returned to 231 units, which is slightly below the previous plateau average of ~293 units. With the date being Nov 11, we are approaching the peak holiday shopping season and potentially colder weather where blazers are used as layering pieces. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage parameters, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the post-hyper-peak stabilization. Since the hyper-peak at Period 33 was an outlier, I will focus on the regime starting Period 34 to current (Periods 34-39). This 6-period window (N=6) captures the return to normalcy (avg ~301) and includes the recent volatility. This provides a mu_hat that balances the plateau demand with the recent softer period, ensuring enough stock for potential November/December spikes without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Post-peak Fall demand (P34-P39) has stabilized at an average of ~301 units, characterized by moderate volatility and a return from the late September hyper-peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the post-peak Fall 'Back-to-Business' regime. The average demand for the last seven periods (P34-P40, excluding the P33 hyper-peak) is approximately 298 units (313, 283, 282, 313, 385, 231, 278). The most recent period saw demand of 278, slightly below this average but consistent with the stabilized regime identified in Carry-over Insights (approx. 301). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the service level (profit $4 vs holding cost $1, which implies an ~80% target service level) against the moderate late-fall volatility (std dev ~48 over the same 7-period range), I will use the last 7 periods to define the current regime. This ensures we capture the stabilization after the September hyper-peak and the late October uptick.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is currently in a stable post-Back-to-Business Fall regime. Analyzing the most recent period (P41) and the broader regime since Period 34 (excluding the P33 hyper-peak), demand has moved into a slightly lower intensity phase compared to the September peaks. The last three periods (P39-P41) show demand of 231, 278, and 245, averaging 251 units, which is a decrease from the ~300 average observed in October. This likely reflects a seasonal transition as the primary 'Back-to-Business' shopping window closes and mid-winter demand sets in. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (avg ~290) while maintaining enough buffer for the moderate volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this category. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated 250-300 unit range without excessive holding costs as we move further into late Q4.

Carry-over insight: Late Fall demand transition detected (Period 39-41): Average demand has softened to ~251 units, a ~17% decrease from the previous post-peak plateau of ~301 units, signaling a seasonal tapering of blazer demand heading into winter.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked significantly to 733 units. Given the date (Cyber Monday/Black Friday week), this is a predictable seasonal event for women's tailoring/blazers. Historically, demand was tapering (P39-41 avg ~251), but this outlier suggests a 'Cyber Week' peak. As we move into December (Period 43, Dec 2), demand is expected to remain higher than the late November baseline but likely lower than the extreme promotional spike of Period 42. Based on the previous year/seasonal trends for festive/workwear, December typically maintains solid volume before a January drop. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the recent trend including the spike, effectively raising the base stock to protect against continued high volume in the lead-up to the holidays, while keeping sigma_hat at recent levels to account for the increased holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Cyber-Week hyper-peak detected in Period 42 (Nov 25): Demand spiked to 733 units from a late-fall average of ~251 (+192%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked to 733 units due to Cyber Week/Holiday shopping, followed by a sharp drop to 169 in Period 43. This pattern mirrors the late-September hyper-peak (P33), which was also highly transitory. History shows that after these extreme spikes (P33 and P42), demand typically reverts to the underlying seasonal regime. For the current late-fall/winter period, excluding the Cyber Week outlier, demand has averaged approximately 250 units (P39-P41: 231, 278, 245; P43: 169). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this post-peak cooling while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) introduced by the spike and the subsequent drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Cyber-Week hyper-peak (Period 42) confirmed as transitory: Demand fell from 733 (P42) to 169 (P43). Post-holiday demand (P43) aligns with the late-fall softening regime of ~250 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a post-holiday stabilization. Period 42 was a major Cyber-Week outlier (733), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (169) and a recovery in Period 44 (304). The late-fall/winter baseline (Period 39 onwards, excluding the P42 spike) is approximately (231+278+245+169+304)/5 = 245 units. Given we are now in mid-December (Period 45), demand typically settles around this baseline for formal wear (blazers) before any potential end-of-year clearance or new spring arrivals. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this post-peak stabilization while ignoring the P42 hyper-peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 220 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization (Period 43-44): Demand has returned to a baseline of ~240-250 units following the Cyber-Week peak, indicating a consistent winter demand level for the blazer category.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd (Period 46), placing us in the pre-holiday/winter demand regime. Since the Cyber-Week spike of 733 units (Period 42), demand has stabilized. The last three periods (P43-P45) show demand levels of 169, 304, and 258, which averages to 243.6 units. This aligns with the 'late-fall/winter' baseline identified in the carry-over insights (~240-250 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 275 units. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent post-spike stability (averaging 244 units) while allowing the OR backend to handle the current volatility (std dev approx 68). This ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock for the final winter periods without over-ordering as the year ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30 (Period 47). Historical data for this Women's Blazer shows a significant demand drop in the final week of December (Period 46 demand was 128, down from a December average of ~244). This decline typically aligns with the post-holiday lull and end-of-year clearance or inventory transitions. Given the current on-hand inventory of 174 units and the observed drop to 128 units, the existing stock is likely sufficient to cover the next period's demand without a large new order. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the December demand profile including the recent drop, which results in a mu_hat of approximately 215. This allows the OR engine to bleed off excess inventory (174 on hand) while maintaining a safe base stock level. Lead time (L) remains 0 as all orders have arrived in the same period placed.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline confirmed: Period 46 (Dec 23) demand dropped to 128, a ~48% decrease from the early December average (~244), signaling end-of-year seasonality.
