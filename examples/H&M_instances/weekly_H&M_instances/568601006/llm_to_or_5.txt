Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's tailoring item. Demand for blazers often sees a rise in late winter and early spring as professionals update their wardrobes. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], with a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of 20.3. There is no evidence of lead time deviation yet, so I will use the promised lead time of 2. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand profile (173.4 units/period) while the OR backend scales this to the (L+1) horizon (3 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is a Women's Blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demand for the last 5 periods was [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], and Period 1's demand was 227, suggesting a slight upward trend or seasonality as we move further into February/Spring. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (207 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, becoming visible in Period 4's start. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand levels (mean approx 187) while excluding the very oldest data points. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period demand window (3 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. The SKU is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer. Historical demand shows a steady increase (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) followed by a significant jump in the last two periods (227, 284), suggesting a seasonal upturn as we move into the spring 'Dressed' season (late Feb). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (207 units) should arrive during Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Orders placed in Period 2 (236 units) should arrive during Period 4. Total in-transit is 443. On-hand is 0, meaning we have lost sales due to stockouts. To respond to the upward demand trend, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth while maintaining safety stock. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=2) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its initial phase. Historical demand [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] and recent demand in Period 1-3 [227, 284, 198] show a higher mean (approx 236) than the past data (approx 173). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, while 757 units are in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rules, the order from P1 (207 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates either a lead time longer than 2 periods or a delay. I will stick to the default lead time for now but monitor for a permanent shift. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the higher recent demand trend (avg 236 vs 173) and default for sigma_hat to maintain a buffer.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's tailored item likely seeing consistent demand in early spring (February-March). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 196.6 units over 10 observations (combining past data [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] and game history [227, 284, 198, 214]). The most recent period (Period 4) showed a lead time of 1 period (ordered P3, arrived P4), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, looking at the 'In-transit' quantity (458 units), these correspond to orders from P1 (207) and P2 (236), which are now 3-4 periods old and haven't 'concluded'. This suggests a potential logistics delay or loss for those specific earlier batches, while the P3 order arrived immediately. Given the current on-hand inventory of 100 units and demand averaging ~200, we are at risk of a stockout. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 1-period lead time, and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand levels (avg ~224 in the last 5 periods) compared to the older pre-game data.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18). The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', which typically sees strong spring demand. Looking at the history, demand has significantly increased compared to the pre-game samples (avg ~173). The last 5 periods show demands of [227, 284, 198, 214, 215], averaging ~228. This represents a sustained regime shift. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times for the only two completed orders (P3 and P4) were actually 1 period. However, we have a significant backlog/lost order issue: the orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) have not arrived (4+ periods elapsed). These are likely lost or severely delayed. Currently, on-hand is 0 and demand is being lost. My goal is to use 'recent_N' to capture the higher demand regime (N=5) and set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to respond to the observed lead-time variance, while the mu_hat calculation (1+L) will help bridge the gap to the next arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1: average demand increased from ~173 to ~228 (+32%) based on 5 periods of data. Early orders from P1 and P2 (443 total units) are significantly overdue (4+ periods) and may be lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blazer (Womens Tailoring). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 6 periods has been: 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215. The average demand since the game started is 225.5, which is significantly higher than the initial seed data (~173). The 'Carry-over Insights' flag that orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively, while orders from P3 and P4 arrived with 1-period lead times. Given these older orders (443 units) have not concluded despite being well past the promised 2-period lead time, I must treat them as likely lost shipments to avoid the OR engine under-ordering based on ghost pipeline inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (average ~225) to capture the current demand level. Because the backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), and 443 units of my 'In-transit' (495) are likely lost, I will use an 'explicit' L to signal that the pipeline should be treated with caution, though the capped policy will still limit the order size. Sigma remains calculated from the recent stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 1 (207 units) and Period 2 (236 units) orders are >4 periods overdue and considered lost. Recent demand regime (P1-P6) stable at avg ~225 units/period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's blazer. Analyzing the 'conclude' messages, we see that orders from P3 and P4 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, whereas orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are now 6 and 5 periods overdue respectively and are confirmed lost. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 725) consists of orders from P6 (52 units) and P7 (230 units), plus the lost P1/P2 units (443 total). Since the OR backend does not know P1 and P2 are lost, it considers pipeline inventory to be 725, which is highly inflated. To force an order and replenish the stock-out (on-hand is 0), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand since Period 1 has stabilized around a mean of 220 units (avg of 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186 = 219.8). With a lead time of 2, the required base stock (L+1) should be around 3 * 220 = 660 units plus safety stock. However, since the backend subtracts 725 (pipeline) from the target, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger a replenishment. The 'cap' also restricts the order size. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to account for the lost units and target a recovery. For L, I use 'recent_N' with N=2 based on the last observed successful arrivals (P3 and P4 both had L=1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). History shows a significant demand shift starting Period 1, where demand increased from a historical mean of ~173 to a recent mean of 223.5 units over the last 8 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 due to missing early shipments. Orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are now 7-8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. However, P3 and P4 orders arrived with a lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2. Recent orders P6, P7, and P8 (total 795 units) are currently in-transit. P6 (52 units) is 3 periods old and should have arrived if lead time was 1-2; its absence suggests potential further delays or instability. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the OR backend use the observed 1-period arrivals while maintaining a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure. Demand is stable at the higher regime, so I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift volatility and mean. Given the stockout, the pipeline inventory (1238) minus the lost 443 units equals 795 real units in-transit, which the OR backend will use against the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: mean increased to ~224 units (8-period avg). P1 and P2 orders (443 units) are definitively lost after 7+ periods of no arrival. Recent successful arrivals (P3, P4) showed an actual lead time of 1 period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' shifted in Period 1 to a higher regime (average ~218 units/period over the last 9 periods). Crucially, orders from P1 and P2 (443 units total) are considered lost as they are 8-9 periods overdue. However, recent orders from P3 and P4 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) to determine orders. Since the backend doesn't know about lost orders, the 'In-transit' figure of 1238 units is dangerously inflated by the 443 lost units. To compensate for this, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust parameters to ensure we maintain coverage despite the backend's belief that those lost units are coming. Since we have no stock and demand is steady around 218, and we expect a 1-2 period lead time, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current stable demand regime (~218 * 3 = 654). To mitigate the 'lost order' inflation in the backend's calculation, I will keep lead time at 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed 1-period arrivals and use default sigma to maintain safety stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The 'Mariette Blazer' is a staple tailoring piece. Reviewing history: P1 and P2 orders (443 units) are lost. P3 and P4 arrived with L=1. P7 arrived in P10 (L=3), showing lead time variability. P6 and P8 orders are still in transit. Demand from P1 to P10 has averaged 204.6 units. Recent demand (P9-P10) dropped to 178 and 130, possibly due to post-Easter cooling or stockouts affecting perceived demand, though we have 100 units on hand now. Since the actual lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (avg of 1, 1, 3). For demand (mu_hat), the recent 10-period average is stable around 205; I will use recent_N=10 to capture this regime while smoothing the recent two-period dip. Sigma_hat will use the same window to capture volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1, 1, and 3 periods. Demand regime stable at ~205 units/period (P1-P10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/04/29), we observe that the high-volume orders from Periods 7 and 8 have finally arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, leaving us with a healthy on-hand inventory of 486 units and 495 units still in-transit. The demand history shows a recent decline from the earlier regime of ~220 units to ~130 units over the last two periods (P10: 130, P11: 127). This suggests a cooling off after the initial spring peak for this blazer. Given the 'Carry-over Insights' regarding lead time variability (observed values of 1, 1, 3, and 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average these observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent downward trend in demand while still accounting for the earlier higher-demand periods to ensure a safe service level, as we have significant stock to cover current needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed: avg demand dropped from ~224 to ~128 units over P10-P11. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the most recent two arrivals (P7 and P8 orders).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees steady demand in spring before tapering off towards summer. Demand analysis: History shows an initial high-demand regime (P1-P9) averaging ~224 units, followed by a recent deceleration (P10-P11) and a slight bounce in P12 (191). The average of the last three periods (P10-P12) is ~149.3. Given the seasonality of blazers, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture this lower spring-tapering demand. Lead time analysis: While the promised lead time is 2, the most recent successful arrivals (P7 and P8 orders) arrived in 3 periods. The P1 and P2 orders are confirmed lost. P6 (52 units) is extremely late (6 periods) and also likely lost. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the current observed delivery speed. On-hand is 295 and in-transit is 495 (including the likely lost 52 from P6), meaning we have substantial coverage for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration from ~224 to ~149 units/period confirmed (P10-P12 average). Lead time has shifted from 1 period (P3-P4) to 3 periods (P7-P8 orders).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is experiencing a post-Easter/Spring demand deceleration. Average demand from Period 10-13 has settled at 152 units, compared to the earlier regime of ~224. The current date (May 13) suggests we are moving past the peak spring tailoring season. Historical lead times for the most recent successful arrivals (P7 and P8 orders) were 3 periods, suggesting the actual lead time is currently 3 rather than the promised 2. The pipeline inventory (495 units) is significant, and with on-hand at 135 units, the total inventory position is 630. Given the current demand mean of ~152, the pipeline covers roughly 4 periods of demand. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect recent history, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand levels of the last month, preventing over-ordering while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~152 units/period (P10-P13 average). Lead time remains consistent at 3 periods for recent completed cycles.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) as of the end of Period 14. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following a peak in early spring, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 160.8 units per period [130, 127, 191, 160, 196]. Carry-over insights and historical arrival data (P7 and P8 orders) confirm that the actual lead time has shifted from 1 period to 3 periods. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this observed reality. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stabilized post-peak demand (approx. 161/period), which ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current volatility. The 'in-transit' of 524 units likely includes the P14 order (29 units) and potentially delayed older shipments (P6-P9), though P1 and P2 orders are considered lost. This setting helps the OR backend target a service level of 0.8 (q = 4/(4+1)).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a Mariette Blazer (Women's Tailoring). Current date is late May (2019/5/27). Demand has transitioned to a lower regime compared to earlier periods, stabilizing around 155 units/period (avg of P10-P15 is ~158). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 699 units in-transit (orders from P6, P14, P15, and the likely lost orders from P1-P2). Note: P6 (52 units) is extremely late (9 periods) and likely lost. The carry-over insights correctly identified a lead time shift from 1 to 3 periods for the P7 and P8 orders. Although we are waiting on the P14/P15 orders to arrive, L=3 remains the most reliable recent observation. I will use N=6 for demand (P10-P15) to capture the lower spring/summer regime and set L=3 based on the most recent successful shipment arrivals to ensure the OR backend maintains sufficient stock across the 4-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring). Historical demand shifted around Period 10 (mid-April), dropping from a mean of ~224 to a new stable regime of ~162 units/period (avg of P10-P16: 130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143, 168). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 699 units in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P1/P2 (443 units) which are considered lost, P6 (52 units) which is now 11 periods overdue and likely lost, and more recent orders from P14 (29 units) and P15 (175 units). Observed lead times for completed cycles have been 1, 1, 3, 3. The P14 order is now in its 3rd period of transit, consistent with the 3-period lead time observed in P10-P11. Given the lead time is likely 3 periods, mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-April regime. L is set to 3 based on the most recent successful arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~162 units/period (P10-P16 average). Order from Period 6 (52 units) is now >10 periods overdue and confirmed lost along with P1/P2 orders.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019/6/10), we observe the arrival of the Period 15 order (175 units) with an actual lead time of 2 periods. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods (P3:1, P4:1, P7:3, P8:3, P15:2). The current 'In-transit' quantity is 524 units, which includes the confirmed lost orders from Period 1 (207), Period 2 (236), and Period 6 (52). Excluding these 495 units, the true active pipeline is only 29 units (from Period 14). Demand has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 10, with an average of approximately 156 units per period (P10-P17). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead time variability and provide a safety buffer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current stable demand regime (P10-P17), and sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently experiencing a demand regime of approximately 161 units/period (average of P10-P18). Although the promised lead time is 2, historical lead times have fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods. The most recent arrival (P15 order) arrived in 2 periods. However, the order from Period 14 (29 units) is now at L=4 and potentially delayed or lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline of 610 units includes significantly overdue orders (P1: 207, P2: 236, P6: 52, P14: 29) totaling 524 units which are likely lost. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is only 86 units (from P18). To ensure availability for the next (L+1) periods (3-4 periods given lead time uncertainty), I will set L to 3 to reflect the recent high-end of observed delivery times and use the stable demand mean of 161. Since the OR engine's pipeline calculation includes all 'in-transit' units (even lost ones), the base stock must be high enough to overcome the ~524 lost units that the engine thinks are coming.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments update: Orders from P1 (207), P2 (236), P6 (52), and now P14 (29) are significantly overdue and likely lost, totaling 524 units in phantom pipeline inventory. Effective lead time is currently fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a critical inventory shortage (on-hand: 0) and a complex pipeline recovery task. Analysis of 'In-transit' (571 units) confirms it contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 207, P2: 236, P6: 52, P14: 29), totaling 524 units that will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline is only 47 units (from P19). The demand regime for this Mariette Blazer is stable at approximately 152 units/period (average of P10-P19). Observed lead times are highly variable (recently 2, 1, 3, 1). To compensate for the 524 lost units and ensure the OR engine places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) horizon, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the promised lead time and a 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current stable demand regime (~152 per period). To force the backend to ignore the 524 phantom units and order enough to restore service, mu_hat must be adjusted. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (571) from the base stock (mu_hat + safety), and only 47 units are real, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 152 + 524 = 980. This ensures the order magnitude covers upcoming demand plus the deficit created by lost historical shipments.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost shipments confirmed: 524 units (P1, P2, P6, P14). Real pipeline is current period's in-transit minus 524.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a lower demand regime, averaging ~152 units/period (P10-P20). However, there is significant noise in the 'In-transit' figure. As documented in carry-over insights, orders from P1 (207), P2 (236), P6 (52), and P14 (29) are considered lost, totaling 524 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 897, but the effective pipeline is only 373 units (the P20 order). To ensure the OR engine places the necessary order to cover future demand without being misled by 'phantom' inventory, I will set 'L' to 2 (promised lead time, though recent arrivals were 1 period, 2 is safer for base-stock calculation) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (P10 to P20) to capture the stabilized lower demand. To bridge the gap created by the 524 lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * (average demand + (lost units / (1+L))). Average demand P10-P20 is ~149. Calculated mu_hat = (1+2) * (149 + 175) = 972. This forces the engine to recognize the need for more physical stock to replace the lost units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 22 (July 2019). The product is a blazer, a category typically stable in late spring/early summer but often sees a slight dip before the late summer/autumn wardrobe shift. Historical demand analysis shows a recent regime change: Period 1-10 averaged ~200+, but Period 11-21 has stabilized at an average of ~141 units. I will use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume period. Regarding inventory: the 'In-transit' of 1024 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. As documented in carry-over insights, orders from P1 (207), P2 (236), P6 (52), and P14 (29) are lost, totaling 524 units. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 1024 - 524 = 500 units. The most recent arrival (P19) showed a lead time of 1 period, but recent history (P7-P15) showed lead times of 2-3 periods. I will use L=2 to provide a conservative buffer for the backend logic. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~141*3 = 423 units). Since on-hand is 0 and real pipeline is 500, the system may not order immediately, which is appropriate given the current excess in transit relative to the recent demand drop.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees steady demand but can fluctuate with seasonal transitions. Demand analysis: From Period 10 to Period 22, demand has stabilized into a lower regime compared to the early periods, averaging approximately 144 units per period. Lead-time analysis: Observed lead times have been highly variable, including 1 period (P3, P4, P18, P19), 2 periods (P15), and 3 periods (P7, P8). However, the most critical issue is the accumulation of lost shipments totaling 524 units (from P1, P2, P6, and P14). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1024), making the 'real' pipeline inventory only 500 units (1024 - 524). These 500 units correspond to orders from P20 (373) and P21 (127). Given the current on-hand inventory of 0 and the stockouts in P21-P22, we need to order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for demand to capture the stable regime since P10, and 'calculate' for lead time to account for the variability. Setting L to 2 (promised) is reasonable given the recent mix of 1-3 period arrivals.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) shows a stabilized demand regime. Since Period 10, demand has averaged approximately 144 units per period (P10-P23), which is lower than the early peak but consistent with summer seasonality for a fitted jacket. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P20 order) taking 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 651 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P6 (52), and P14 (29), totaling 524 units. The real pipeline inventory is therefore 651 - 524 = 127 units (the P21 order). With 253 units on hand, the total effective inventory is 380 units. To maintain the service level while accounting for the 524 lost units, I will set L to 3 (the most recent lead time) and use recent_N for mu_hat (N=14 to capture the stable post-peak regime) and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~576 units), which will trigger an order to replenish the gap between 576 and 380.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29 (Period 25). The product is a women's blazer. Analyzing demand: We are currently in a lower demand regime compared to the start of the year. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand averaged ~88 units/period, showing a significant drop from the P10-P16 average of ~150-160 units. This aligns with mid-summer seasonality for tailored jackets. Analyzing lead time: The two most recent arrivals (P20 and P21 orders) arrived after 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure is 524, which exactly matches the cumulative lost units identified in the Carry-over Insights (P1: 207, P2: 236, P6: 52, P14: 29). This means the 'effective' pipeline is zero. However, on-hand inventory is 317 units. With current demand around 63-90 units, the current stock covers approximately 3.5 to 5 periods. I will set L to 3 (based on recent experience) and use recent_N=5 for demand (avg ~88) to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal lull. The OR backend will see pipeline=524, on-hand=317, and base_stock based on my parameters; given the high phantom pipeline, it will likely order 0, which is appropriate given the high on-hand stock relative to current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand has decelerated to an average of ~88 units/period over P20-P24 (down from ~150-160). Effective pipeline is 0 units as all 524 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: The current product is a women's blazer. Current on-hand inventory is 223 units, with a nominal in-transit of 524 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', these 524 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. The demand regime has shifted downwards significantly starting around P20; the average demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is approximately 98 units per period (73, 116, 120, 120, 63, 94). Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P23, P24) were 3 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this lower-demand summer phase (August), I will set L to 3 to reflect recent experience and use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (~98 units/period). With on-hand inventory at 223 and effective pipeline at 0, the backend base stock calculation [(1+3)*98 = 392 plus safety stock] will trigger a replenishment order to cover the gap between current stock and expected demand over the lead time, accounting for the 524 units of phantom inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 27 (2019/8/12). The product is a Mariette Blazer. Reviewing historical demand, we are in a lower demand regime compared to the early periods. Over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has averaged approximately 104.5 units per period. The last two periods (P25 and P26) showed 94 and 146 units respectively, suggesting a slight uptick from the P20-P24 average of 88, but still significantly lower than the P1-P19 average of ~170. We will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime. Regarding lead time, the last four arrivals (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21) arrived with lead times of 1, 1, 3, and 3 periods respectively. The average of these recent deliveries is 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 524 units is entirely comprised of lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14 orders), meaning the functional pipeline is 0. With 77 units on-hand, we need to ensure the order covers the lead time plus current period demand (L+1 periods). Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=7) and sigma_hat (N=7) will allow the OR backend to set a base stock reflective of the current ~100-unit/period demand environment while ignoring the phantom pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows a significant spike in Period 27 (301 units) after a period of deceleration (~88 units). This spike coincides with the mid-August transition toward autumn fashion, which is highly relevant for a 'Womens Tailoring Blazer.' Historically, demand was higher (~150-200) before the summer dip. On-hand inventory is now 0. The current in-transit quantity of 524 units consists entirely of lost orders (P1, P2, P6, P14), meaning the actual pipeline inventory is 0. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 to balance the risk. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent upward momentum (averaging ~180 units) while accounting for the seasonal transition back to higher blazer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 27 (301 units) confirms seasonal recovery for tailored blazers heading into late Q3. Real pipeline remains 0 as 524 units are confirmed lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is experiencing a seasonal surge in late August (Period 27: 301 units, Period 28: 251 units). This aligns with the transition to the fall fashion season. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 698, but 524 of these units (from P1, P2, P6, P14) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 174 units (ordered P28). Observed lead times recently range between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being a safer estimate to avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase. I will set L to 3. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture the sharp increase from ~100 to ~230+ units observed in the last three periods (P26-P28). This ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak for tailored blazers confirmed in late August (Periods 27-28), with demand increasing ~180% compared to the P20-P25 average. Cumulative lost shipments remain at 524 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing a confirmed seasonal demand surge as expected for womens tailoring in late August/early September. Demand in P27-P29 has averaged ~261 units, a significant increase from the summer low of ~88 units (P20-P25). Lead times remain highly volatile, recently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P28 order arrived in 1 period, whereas P20-P21 took 3). Currently, 'In-transit' is 887, but 524 units are confirmed lost (P1, P2, P6, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 363 (the P29 order). With 0 on-hand and a forecast of ~260 units/period, we need to maintain a higher base stock to cover the (L+1) window. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative against recent longer delays, and mu_hat to 1044 (explicit) which represents 4 periods (L+1) of the current seasonal demand level (~261 * 4). Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Late August/September demand (P27-P29) stabilized at ~261 units/period, up from ~88 units in July.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a peak seasonal demand regime (late August/September). Recent demand (P27-P30) has averaged approximately 285 units per period, a significant jump from the July average of ~90. We are currently experiencing stockouts due to this surge. The in-transit inventory of 1129 units is heavily skewed by 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14). Subtracting these, the functional pipeline is 605 units (P29 order of 363 and P30 order of 242). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will use a conservative estimate of 2. To capture the current seasonal peak without being overly influenced by the prior low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to cover the P27-P30 surge and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility. This will signal the OR backend to maintain higher base stock levels to meet the $4 profit margin while accounting for the high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak for blazers confirmed: Demand increased from ~90 to ~285 units/period starting P27. Cumulative lost shipments remain at 524 units (P1, P2, P6, P14), which must be discounted from the observed In-transit total.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant seasonal peak in September. Current demand (Periods 27-31) averages 293.6 units/period, compared to the July low of ~88. On-hand inventory is low (35 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 766 units includes 524 units from lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 242 units (ordered in Period 30). These 242 units are expected to arrive in Period 32 or 33 based on recent lead times of 1-2 periods. To cover the current seasonal high across the lead time (L=2) and the review period (total 3 periods), mu_hat is set to 885 based on the recent 5-period average (~295 * 3). sigma_hat is adjusted to account for higher volatility during this peak. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability between 1 and 3 periods observed in recent cycles.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak demand for blazers reached a high of ~295 units/period in September (P27-P31). Pipeline inventory continues to include 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), which must be manually subtracted to find the effective pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a peak seasonal demand regime (late August through September). Average demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) is approximately 285 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0, and the recorded In-transit is 766 units. However, based on extensive history, 524 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1: 207, P2: 236, P6: 52, P14: 29). Subtracting these from the 766 units leaves an effective pipeline of 242 units (the P30 order). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - pipeline), the presence of 524 phantom units will prevent it from ordering enough. To compensate for these 524 lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the 524 lost units. With an estimated L of 2 (most recent arrival was 2 periods), (L+1) = 3 periods. Forecasted demand = 3 * 285 = 855. Adding the 524 lost units gives a mu_hat of 1379. This 'fools' the OR engine into ordering as if the pipeline were actually 242. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect current high volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant seasonal peak in September, with Period 33 demand reaching 612 units, far exceeding previous peak estimates of ~295. The current demand regime (P27-P33) averages ~330 units per period. Lead times are highly variable (recently 1, 2, and 3 periods), so I will use a conservative L=3 to ensure coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 1198 includes 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 674 units (the P33 order). With 0 on-hand and 674 in effective transit, we need to set parameters to cover the (L+1) = 4 period window. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the seasonal surge and explicit L=3 to account for recent delivery delays. This should trigger a substantial order to meet the sustained high demand and replenish depleted stock.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand for blazers peaked significantly in late September (Period 33) at 612 units. The current seasonal regime (P27-P33) averages ~330 units/period. Lost shipments remain constant at 524 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand seasonal peak typical for autumn tailoring. Current demand (P27-P34) averages 339 units/period, with a significant spike to 612 units in P33. While the most recent demand in P34 (313 units) suggests a slight stabilization, volatility remains high. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use a conservative L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, as recent cycles have completed quickly (P33 ordered P33, arrived P34). The 'In-transit' figure of 922 includes 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 398 units (the P34 order). With 361 units on hand and 398 in the pipeline (total 759), and considering the seasonal average demand of ~339, we are currently covered for approximately 2.2 periods. To maintain a high service level during this peak while demand remains high, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-volume regime (last 8 periods).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for blazers remains active (avg ~339 units/period since P27). Cumulative lost shipments remain at 524 units (P1, P2, P6, P14), meaning effective pipeline is (In-transit - 524).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand seasonal peak (Sept/Oct). The current demand regime (since Period 27) averages ~331 units per period. In Period 35, demand was 283 units. Inventory is low (on-hand 78). The total in-transit is 922 units, but 524 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), making the effective pipeline 398 units (the order from P34). Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability during this peak while accounting for the lost shipments 'bloating' the OR engine's pipeline view, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the higher seasonal mean (~331) and using 'recent_N' for L with N=5 to reflect the recent average lead time of 2 periods. This configuration will prompt the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock for the seasonal peak while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak demand for blazers remains high but may be plateauing (P27-P35 avg ~331 units). Effective pipeline must always be calculated as (In-transit - 524) due to confirmed lost orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21), demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized following a significant late September peak (612 units in P33). The last three periods (P34-P36) show a stable average demand of ~293 units, suggesting the extreme seasonal peak has passed but demand remains elevated compared to summer levels. Effective inventory management is complicated by 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14) still appearing in 'In-transit' data; the true pipeline is 398 units (ordered in P34). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 398, new orders are necessary to meet the current demand regime of ~293 units/period. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (which has fluctuated between 1 and 3). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current post-peak stabilization (~293/period) rather than the earlier extreme spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the lower volatility observed in the last three periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring item. Demand peaked significantly in late September (Period 33 demand: 612) and has since stabilized at a high level. The average demand from Period 31 to 37 is approximately 309 units/period. The current date is October 28, moving into the late autumn season where blazer demand typically remains stable or begins a slight deceleration before winter. I am observing a stable seasonal plateau. Lead times for the last three arrived orders (P30, P33, P34) were 3, 1, and 3 periods respectively, averaging 2.33 periods. I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this active seasonal peak (avg ~309). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 524 units is entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), as confirmed in multiple carry-over insights. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 0. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data, the OR backend will trigger a new order to replenish the current low on-hand stock (85) and satisfy the high seasonal demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), the demand for the Mariette Blazer remains high, averaging 330 units/period since the seasonal peak began in late August (P27-P38). The most recent demand (P38) was 385 units. Total In-transit is 1069 units, but this includes 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), making the effective pipeline 545 units (the order from P38). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have been volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 for recent successful arrivals). To ensure availability during this high-demand period while accounting for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to reflect the seasonal average (approx. 330 units) and keep lead time at 3 to be conservative against recent delays. This will trigger the OR backend to order sufficient stock to cover the seasonal pace, adjusting for the fact that nearly half of the 'In-transit' quantity doesn't exist.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (Autumn/Winter retail season). The average demand since Period 27 is approximately 324 units/period, but recent volatility shows spikes as high as 612 (P33) and 385 (P38). The most recent demand (P39) was 231. The pipeline inventory of 1069 includes 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 545 units (the order from P38). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3), I will set L to 2 (promised) and use recent_N for mu_hat based on the seasonal regime (last 13 periods, P27-P39) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current high-demand environment. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the significant volatility seen during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak (Autumn/Winter) for blazers remains active with high volatility (P27-P39 avg: 324 units). Cumulative lost shipments remain at 524 units (P1, P2, P6, P14), requiring an effective pipeline calculation of (In-transit - 524).

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak Autumn/Winter season. Demand from Period 27 to Period 40 has averaged approximately 320 units per period, though it remains volatile (ranging from 231 to 612). In-transit inventory is reported as 1119, but 524 of these units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 2, 6, and 14, making the effective pipeline only 595 units (Orders from P38 and P40). Actual lead times recently have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using L=2 (promised) as the anchor but ensure mu_hat covers the sustained high seasonal demand. I am selecting recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat to capture the entire seasonal peak starting at Period 27, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle the ~320 units/period demand during this window.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Autumn/Winter seasonal demand period. In Period 41, the order from Period 38 (545 units) arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, leaving 300 units on-hand. The current in-transit inventory is 574 units, but this includes 524 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 207, P2: 236, P6: 52, P14: 29). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 50 units (the order from P40). Demand over the most recent seasonal block (P27-P41) averages approximately 315 units per period. To ensure coverage over the L+1 window (4 periods) and account for lead time variability (which has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture this high-demand regime, while using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the most frequent recent actual arrival delay. The OR engine will subtract the 'phantom' 524 units from its pipeline calculation, potentially leading to an undersupply if not careful, but the explicit mu_hat and high sigma_hat should buffer against stockouts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019 (Period 43). We are in the peak winter season for the 'Mariette Blazer'. Demand spiked significantly in Period 42 to 733 units (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), which depleted all on-hand inventory. The current In-transit is 1045 units. However, consistent with carry-over insights, 524 units from early periods (P1, P2, P6, P14) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 521 units (1045 - 524), consisting of orders from P40 (50 units) and P42 (471 units). The recent demand regime (P33-P42) averages ~367 units/period, but the spike in P42 suggests we should remain aggressive to capture high late-season demand while balancing the risk of a post-holiday drop. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the sustained seasonal peak mean (~367) while recognizing the volatility. Lead time is set to 3 periods (explicit) based on the most recent arrivals (P34, P38) confirming a 3-period cycle, ensuring the OR backend targets coverage for (3+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 42 (733 units) confirmed, likely linked to Black Friday/Cyber Monday; the seasonal peak remains active but highly volatile. Effective pipeline remains (In-transit - 524).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). Historical demand patterns show a significant spike around late November (Period 42, 733 units), which corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday for this blazer SKU. Following this spike, Period 43 demand dropped to 169 units, suggesting a post-promotion lull or normalization. The average demand for the 'Autumn/Winter Peak' (P27-P43) is 314 units per period. The effective in-transit pipeline must be adjusted by subtracting the 524 units confirmed lost (P1, P2, P6, P14). Total In-transit is 1690, so effective pipeline is 1166 units (covering orders from P40, P42, P43). Given the current on-hand is 0 and we are entering the mid-December period where tailoring demand typically stabilizes before a potential holiday break or end-of-year clearance, I will use a recent_N (N=10) to capture the high-demand season while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time (L) has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently; setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to use the historical average of observed lead times (approx 2.2 periods), which is appropriate for the current stability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand drop observed in P43 (169 units) following P42 spike (733 units). Seasonal peak (P27-P43) average is 314 units. Cumulative lost shipments remain at 524 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, which is post-Black Friday but still within the peak winter season for blazers. Demand remains high but volatile: P42 (733 units), P43 (169 units), and P44 (304 units). The average demand for the active seasonal regime (P27-P44) is approximately 313 units/period. The total 'In-transit' quantity reported is 1219, but historical tracking confirms that 524 units (from P1, P2, P6, and P14) are lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 1219 - 524 = 695 units (consisting of orders from P40 and P43). Current on-hand is 167. Total effective inventory position = 167 + 695 = 862 units. Recent lead times have stabilized between 2 and 3 periods (P38: 3, P42: 2), so I will maintain L at the promised 2 periods while using recent_N for demand to capture the seasonal average. I choose N=18 to cover the entire peak regime (P27-P44).

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand stabilization: Following the P42 spike (733), demand has settled back to a seasonal average of ~313 units (P27-P44). Effective pipeline must always be calculated as (In-transit - 524) due to confirmed losses.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, following the peak holiday shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Demand has stabilized post-spike, with the last two periods (P44-P45) averaging 281 units, which is close to the long-term seasonal average (P27-P45 avg: 310). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The In-transit total is 1219 units, but 524 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P2, P6, P14), making the effective pipeline 695 units. Specifically, the P40 order (50) and P43 order (645) are expected to arrive shortly. Given the lead time is fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (P42 took 2, P38 took 3), I will set L to 2 to represent the promised and most recent actual lead time. mu_hat is set to 310 (recent seasonal average) x (1+L) to ensure we maintain coverage for the remainder of the winter season, accounting for the 1-period observation delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019), we observe a significant demand drop in the last two periods (P45: 258, P46: 128) following the peak holiday season. This aligns with post-Christmas/end-of-year retail patterns for women's tailoring. Current On-hand is healthy at 517 units, and In-transit is 574 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, 524 units in the pipeline are historically confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P2, P6, P14). Subtracting these from the In-transit total (574 - 524) leaves an effective pipeline of 50 units (the order from P40). The total inventory position (On-hand 517 + Effective Pipeline 50 = 567) is substantial given the decelerating demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-holiday mean (~215 units) rather than the long-term seasonal peak average, as demand is likely to stay lower in January. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-3 period variance. No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend given the high current stock relative to the new demand mean.
