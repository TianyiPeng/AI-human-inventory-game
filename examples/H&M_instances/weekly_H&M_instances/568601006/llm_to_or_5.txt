Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is likely a staple item for women's professional/dressed tailoring. Current historical demand (N=5) averages 173.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 19.4. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the start of the simulation and no current inventory, I will use all available historical demand data (N=5) to set the initial base stock. Since actual lead time is unknown but promised at 4, I'll use the 'default' L setting. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the recent 5 data points to reflect the recent demand trend accurately while accounting for the look-ahead window of (L+1) = 5 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). History shows a demand of 227 in Period 1, but we had 0 on-hand, resulting in 227 lost sales. The promised lead time is 4. An order of 207 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit; based on L=4, it should arrive in Period 5. Historical demand samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227] suggest a recent upward trend (last 3: 196, 186, 227). Mean of all 6 samples is 182.3; mean of the last 3 is 203. Given the blazer category and the date (mid-February), we might be entering a spring tailoring season. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent demand increase and use default L=4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand at the higher recent rate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product (Mariette Blazer) has high demand (P1: 227, P2: 284), significantly higher than the training period average (~170). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 457 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1's order was placed in P1, we expect it to arrive during P5 (visible in the P6 conclude message). Currently, we have 457 units in pipeline to cover future demand, but our 'on-hand' is empty, leading to lost sales. Current demand shows a clear upward trend/shift compared to the provided history [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. I will use recent_N=2 to capture this 200-300 range demand shift for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. For L, I will stick to 'default' (promised lead time of 4) as we have seen no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product (Mariette Blazer) is a seasonal fashion item. Demand history [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227, 284, 198] shows a mean of approximately 197. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (207 units), P2 (250 units), and P3 (322 units) are all in-transit, totaling 779 units. Since the lead time is 4, the first order (from P1) is expected to arrive in Period 5 and become visible in the P5 conclude message (ready for use in P6). Current on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales. However, the system's stock-out is due to the initialization and lead time offset, not necessarily a failure of the OR policy parameters themselves. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slightly higher demand seen in the most recent periods (avg ~236) compared to the long-term average, ensuring the base stock level targets the current trend as we approach the spring season. Sigma is set to default to use all available variance data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer), and we have seen 5 initial demand periods (including pre-game): [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] and the reported history demands for Periods 1-4: [227, 284, 198, 214]. The mean demand for all 9 observations is approximately 199 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order placed in Period 1 (207 units) should arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will only be confirmed in the Period 5 conclude message (start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 1086 units in transit (207+250+322+307). Since no orders have concluded yet, we cannot infer a lead-time drift. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly higher demand seen in the last 4 periods (avg ~230) compared to the initial seed data.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demand data provided was [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] and the live game demand from P1-P5 has been [227, 284, 198, 214, 215]. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 227.6, which is notably higher than the pre-game samples (mean 173.4). We observed our first arrival in Period 5 (ordered P1, arrived P5), confirming the promised lead time L=4. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline shows orders placed in P2, P3, P4, and P5 are yet to arrive (totaling 1018 units), our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline (1018) is roughly 4.5 periods of demand (1018/227.6), which is slightly below the required safety levels for a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (4+1)). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime seen in the live game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from P1: mean increased from ~173 (pre-game) to 227.6 (+31%) across the first 5 periods. Lead time of 4 periods confirmed by P5 arrival of P1 order.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its spring season. Since the start of the game, we've transitioned from an initial demand spike (P1-P2 avg: 255) to a stable regime (P3-P6 avg: 210.5). For Period 7, I will use a window of the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable demand pattern since the early volatility. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 35 on hand and 951 in transit (orders from P3 to P6). The order arriving in Period 7 (placed in P3, 322 units) plus current on-hand (35) should comfortably cover the expected demand of ~215, avoiding stockouts. The OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline covering 5 periods of demand (L+1); using N=4 ensures the base stock reflects the current stable trend rather than the earlier peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial two periods; P3-P6 average is 210.5 vs P1-P2 average of 255.5.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a women's blazer. Historical demand across P1-P7 is [227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186]. Demand has cooled from an early peak (P1-P2 avg: 255.5) to a more stable level (P3-P7 avg: 205.6). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived exactly in 4 periods). Pipeline inventory is healthy (712 units in transit, with 307 units expected to arrive in Period 8). I will set L to 'calculate' as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P3-P7) to capture the stabilized demand level of ~206/period, while avoiding the early noise. Given the product type and spring season, demand is expected to remain steady. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized. P3-P7 average demand is 205.6, significantly lower than the initial P1-P2 average of 255.5. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods across three consecutive arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer). Since Period 3, demand has been relatively stable with a mean of 212.4 (P3-P8). The initial demand spike in P1-P2 (average 255.5) appears to have passed. In-transit arrivals (P1 through P4) have consistently shown a lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time. We currently have 229 on-hand and 575 in-transit (orders from P5-P8). Given the replenishment cycle (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Using recent_N with N=6 (P3-P8) for mu_hat captures the current stable regime. For sigma_hat, N=8 provides a robust volatility measure across the game history.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has shown a demand stabilization since Period 3. The mean demand for P3-P9 is 207.7 units, which is lower than the initial spike in P1-P2 (average 255.5). The most recent demand was 178. The actual lead time has consistently been confirmed at 4 periods across five arrivals (P1-P5 orders). Currently, we have 190 units on-hand and 700 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Given the date (April 15th), we are moving deeper into the Spring/Summer season for Blazers; however, the data suggests a steady-state rather than a new growth phase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since demand stabilized in P3, and maintain L at 'default' since the 4-period lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 3 at a mean of 207.7 units (P3-P9 average). Actual Lead Time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has shown a slight downward trend over the last two periods (178 and 130), contrasting with the average of ~207 units observed since Period 3. This could be due to a post-Easter/spring shopping lull or a specific demand shift. However, to avoid over-reacting to a single low data point (P10's 130 units), I will use the last 8 periods (P3-P10) to calculate parameters, which captures the stable post-launch regime while incorporating the most recent data. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. Using N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a balanced estimate of the (L+1) demand requirements, ensuring the pipeline (711 in-transit) and on-hand (243) are sufficient for the 5-period horizon.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a typical spring/transitional apparel item. Observing demand from Period 9 to Period 11, there is a clear downward trend (178, 130, 127) compared to the Period 3-8 average of ~213. This suggests the peak spring demand season for this blazer is tapering off as we head into May. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is ~145. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of N=4 to capture this decline while maintaining some buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (L=4), making the lead-time-plus-review-period (L+1) equal to 5. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 9 periods (since the initial spike in P1-P2) to account for recent volatility. The pipeline (In-transit: 731) and on-hand (199) are sufficient, but the OR backend needs updated parameters to manage the safety stock for the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed post-Easter: mean demand dropped from ~213 (P3-P8) to ~145 (P9-P11), a decrease of ~32%.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in Period 13 (May 6th). Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-2 averaged ~255, Periods 3-8 averaged ~207, and Periods 9-12 (post-Easter) averaged ~156. The most recent demand (P12) spiked unexpectedly to 191, likely a minor post-holiday correction or standard volatility, but the overall trend since P9 is lower than the early spring peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P8 order arriving in P12). Current inventory (On-hand 178 + In-transit 563) is 741 units. At a recent mean of ~156, this covers roughly 4.75 periods, matching the (L+1) requirement. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower post-Easter regime (mean ~156.5), and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture volatility since the mid-season stabilization. L remains 'default' at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift post-Easter (P9-P12): mean dropped from ~207 to ~156.5 units (-24%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a Spring/Summer item. Demand analysis shows a clear regime shift after Period 8 (post-Easter/mid-Spring). The mean demand from P9 to P13 has been 157.2 units, compared to the earlier cycle (P3-P8) of ~213 units. The last two periods (P12-P13) show demand at 191 and 160, suggesting a slight stabilization or variance around the new lower mean of approx 160-170. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 282 and In-transit at 426 (total 708), and a lead time of 4 (covering 5 periods of demand), the system is currently overstocked relative to the new demand regime (708 / 160 \u2248 4.4 periods of safety, but we need to cover L+1=5). However, 426 in-transit includes orders from P10-P13. The P10 order (194) is expected to arrive in Period 14. Setting N=5 for mu_hat specifically targets this post-Easter regime (Avg demand P9-P13 = 157.2). For sigma_hat, using N=5 captures the recent volatility (std dev \u2248 27). This will allow the OR backend to adjust orders downward to mitigate holding costs while maintaining a service level based on recent demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed post-Easter (P9-P13): mean demand decreased to 157.2 (down ~24% from the previous 207 mean). Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a sustained demand regime shift following the Easter period. From Period 9 to Period 14, demand has averaged 163.7 units, which is significantly lower than the ~207 units observed in the preceding pre-Easter period (P3-P8). The most recent demand (P14) was 196, showing some recovery compared to the lows of ~130, but still within the lower post-Easter distribution. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 280 and in-transit at 364 (totaling 644), we are well-stocked for approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent over-ordering as the season progresses into late May, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the post-Easter mean (approx. 164 units per period). This will result in a base stock targeted at covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at these levels.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Womens Blazer) is in a post-Easter period (late May). Examining the history from Period 9 onwards (April 8th to May 20th), the demand mean has shifted lower. The average demand for P9-P15 is 160.7 units, compared to the early-game average of ~207. Recent demand (P12-P15) shows fluctuations (191, 160, 196, 143) but maintains an average around 172.5. Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P11 order arriving in P15). Currently, on-hand inventory is 240 and in-transit is 474 (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), leading to a pipeline of 714 units. This pipeline covers roughly 4.4 periods of demand at the recent 160-170 rate. To align the OR backend with this lower demand regime, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering the post-Easter period) and keep the stable lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand regime (P9-P15) confirmed at a lower mean of 160.7 units (-22% from P3-P8 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is a Mariette Blazer, a women's tailored jacket. Following a post-Easter dip, demand appears to have stabilized into a 'shoulder season' regime. Since Period 9 (post-Easter), the mean demand has hovered around 161.6 units (P9-P16 average), which is significantly lower than the P3-P8 average of ~208. The most recent demand (P16) was 168. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. I am setting parameters based on this stabilized lower demand regime (N=8 periods, from P9 to P16). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the (1+L) projection of this ~162 mean. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current volatility while avoiding the high variance of the earlier spring peak. On-hand at 74 is low, but with 616 units in-transit (reflecting orders from periods 13-16), the pipeline is sufficient to cover future demand without excessive over-ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear shift after Period 8 (post-Easter/Spring peak). From Period 9 to Period 17, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Calculating the mean for this current regime (P9-P17), the average demand is 156.7 units. The standard deviation for this same period is 28.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17. To align the OR backend with this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9, covering the Period 9-17 regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed stable lead time of 4. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects current lower consumption rates while maintaining adequate safety stock for the current volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) has entered a lower demand regime since Period 9. The current date is June 17th, which in the fashion cycle often marks a transition away from spring layering pieces like blazers. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 18 is 155.0 units, compared to the earlier Spring peak (P3-P8) of 207.7. Recent demand (P17-P18) has dropped further to an average of 128.5. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 76 and a significant pipeline of 623 units (largely from orders in P15-P18), the system is well-covered. I will set L to 4 using the calculate method. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the post-Easter regime (mean ~155). Considering the slight downward trend in the last two weeks, a 10-week window provides a stable but seasonally appropriate estimate. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand regime (P9-P18) remains stable at a lower mean of 155.0 units. A potential secondary decline is visible in June (P17-P18 avg: 128.5), possibly reflecting the transition to mid-summer seasonal demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a Mariette Blazer, a women's tailoring item typically used for office wear or formal dressing. Historically, demand for blazers often experiences a seasonal decline during the peak summer months (July/August) as consumers shift toward lighter apparel. Recent demand data supports this: mean demand from P9-P15 was ~160, but the last four periods (P16-P19) have dropped to an average of 136.75 (168, 118, 139, 122), with the most recent two weeks averaging 130.5. A new demand regime appears to be forming for the summer season. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this summer slowdown while maintaining sufficient inventory for the 4-period lead time pipeline. This recent period (N=4) reflects the most accurate current state of mid-summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P16-P19): mean demand has decreased to 136.8 units, down from the post-Easter mean of ~160. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering the mid-summer demand phase for the Mariette Blazer. Historical data shows a clear downward shift in demand starting around Period 17 (June), with the most recent demand (Period 20) dropping to 73 units. The summer regime average (P16-P20) is approximately 124 units, significantly lower than the post-Easter mean of 160. Using N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) captures this recent decline while providing enough data to buffer against absolute lows. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P12 through P16. With on-hand inventory at 238 and in-transit at 416, the system has a significant stock position relative to current demand, so the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to avoid holding costs while maintaining the target service level based on the lower summer demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for 568601006 confirmed (P17-P20): mean demand further decreased to 113.0 units, down from the post-Easter mean of ~160. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a mid-summer demand regime. For the period P17-P21, the mean demand is 113.6 units (118, 139, 122, 73, 116), which is a significant drop from the post-Easter average of ~160 and the early spring average of ~207. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With high on-hand (290) and in-transit (280) inventory relative to current demand, the OR backend needs to pull back on ordering to minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 captures this low mid-summer demand regime specifically. Using L=4 based on consistent arrivals from P1-P17 ensures the pipeline is correctly accounted for. The backend will likely order minimal units as the current pipeline easily covers the (L+1) horizon at this demand level.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for 568601006 (P17-P21) confirmed at a mean of 113.6 units, reflecting a seasonal low for blazers in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) is currently in a mid-summer seasonal low. As of Period 23 (July 15), demand has stabilized in the 113-120 range. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is 114.7 units. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P18 order arrived in P22). With 268 units on-hand and 226 units in-transit (total pipeline of 494), current inventory is sufficient for roughly 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), being overstocked is costly. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the summer demand mean more accurately while maintaining a reasonable buffer for volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a mid-summer seasonal trough. Demand has stabilized around a lower mean; for the last 7 periods (P17-P23), the mean demand is 117.8 units. Current on-hand inventory is 277 units, and with the most recent demand being 120 units, we have over 2 periods of coverage on hand. The in-transit inventory of 218 units consists of orders from P20 (21), P21 (32), P22 (44), and P23 (121). Since the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, the P20 order (21 units) will arrive this period (P24). Given the current high inventory levels (On-hand + In-transit = 495) relative to the current demand regime (~118 units/period), the OR engine will likely result in a zero or very small order. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the summer demand level and volatility (117.8 mean and ~20.9 std), while maintaining the default lead time which aligns with the observed 4-period stability.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P23) for 568601006 has stabilized at a mean of 117.8 units, reflecting seasonal lows for blazers in July. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (SKU 568601006) is currently in a mid-summer seasonal low (July). Demand from Period 17 to Period 24 has stabilized at a mean of 111.1 units per period (Avg of [118, 139, 122, 73, 116, 120, 120, 63]). The last period (P24) showed a demand of 63, which is a significant outlier on the low side, possibly indicating the absolute trough of summer or a specific low-demand event. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 235 units and in-transit is 318 units, totaling a pipeline of 553 units. Given the mean demand of ~111 over (L+1)=5 periods, the expected requirement is ~555 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this mid-summer regime transition and stabilize around the current low-demand plateau. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-demand spring period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for 568601006 (P17-P24) confirmed at a mean of 111.1 units, slightly lower than previous July estimates due to a P24 dip to 63.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early August (P26). Historical demand for this blazer has shown a distinct seasonal decline throughout the summer, reaching a stabilized low mean. The demand over the most recent 9 periods (P17-P25) averages 105.8 units, compared to the spring average of ~160 and earlier peak of ~200+. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 99.3. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this summer baseline, as it encompasses the most recent stable regime while buffering the volatility of the P24 dip (63) and P25 recovery (94). Lead time remains remarkably stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals from P1-P21). Current inventory (On-hand: 173 + In-transit: 327 = 500) is sufficient to cover roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the current rate (105-110 units/period). Given L=4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). I will maintain recent_N methods to allow the system to respond naturally to potential late-summer/pre-autumn demand shifts while maintaining the current lean summer inventory levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Historically, the 'summer slump' for this women's blazer (SKU 568601006) appears to be ending, as evidenced by a demand increase to 146 in Period 26, up from the July average of ~111. This suggests the start of a 'Back-to-Business' or fall transition regime where demand typically recovers. To capture this upward shift without over-reacting to a single data point, I am shifting from the 'mid-summer' regime (last 10 periods) to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5. This N includes the recent low (63) and the recent high (146), providing a balanced forecast for the transition. The lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods. On-hand is low (71), but in-transit is healthy (367), meaning my primary goal is to maintain the pipeline for the expected demand recovery in September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P26 (146 units): transition from mid-summer lows (July avg ~111) to late-summer/pre-fall recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $768.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has surged significantly in the last two periods (P26: 146, P27: 301), signaling the end of the mid-summer low (mean ~111) and the start of the late-summer/pre-fall recovery. The P27 demand of 301 is the highest observed in the history of this SKU, likely driven by back-to-work shopping in mid-August. We are currently stocked out (Ending inventory P27 = 0), and while 407 units are in-transit, we need to ensure the parameters reflect this new higher-demand regime to allow the OR engine to place sufficient orders. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the sharp upward trend (P25: 94, P26: 146, P27: 301) while maintaining the stable lead time of 4 periods. This helps the backend recognize that the expected demand across the lead time has nearly doubled compared to July.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late-summer/pre-fall recovery: demand spiked from July mean of ~111 to 301 in P27. New regime mean (P26-P27) is 223.5 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has clearly transitioned into a high-demand late-summer/early-fall regime. After a July low (mean ~111), demand in P27 was 301 and P28 was 251. The current date (August 26) suggests back-to-work and autumn fashion trends are driving this spike. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P26-P28) is 232.7 units. However, given the product type (Blazer) and the sharp rise in demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture this recent momentum. In-transit inventory is 644 units (orders from P25-P28). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P27 and P28, the goal is to replenish to cover the (L+1) horizon. Setting mu_hat using N=3 (approx 233 per period) leads to a base stock for 5 periods of ~1165 units. Subtracting the pipeline of 644 results in a significant order to catch up with the seasonal demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work demand surge confirmed (P26-P28): mean demand increased to 232.7 units from July mean of 111 units (+110%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing a significant Fall/Back-to-work demand surge. Demand increased from a mid-summer average of ~111 units to a new mean of ~232.7 units starting at P26. The last three periods (P27-P29) show sustained high demand: 301, 251, and 231. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has exceeded arrivals for the last three periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21, P22, P23, P24, and P25 orders arrived exactly on schedule). For Period 30, mu_hat needs to reflect the new regime (P26-P29 mean is ~232). Using recent_N=4 captures this jump. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to account for the increased volatility during this surge. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work demand surge confirmed (P26-P29): mean demand increased to 232.25 units from July mean of 111 units (+109%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has surged significantly as we enter the fall 'Back-to-work' season (September). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 257.2 units, up from the July/summer low of 111 units. The most recent demand (P30) peaked at 357 units. I am currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) due to this rapid transition, with 1199 units in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend and recent peak of 357, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher fall regime, while using an explicit sigma_hat of 80 to account for increased volatility during this seasonal transition and to prevent stockouts while waiting for the pipeline to arrive. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a high base stock to satisfy the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work demand surge (P26-P30) refined: mean demand has increased to 257.2 units, with a recent peak of 357 units in P30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a significant Fall/Back-to-work demand regime that began around Period 26. The demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) has been [146, 301, 251, 231, 357, 328], reflecting a mean of 269 units, which is a massive increase from the July summer lows (~111 units). Demand in the most recent two periods (P30-P31) has averaged 342.5, suggesting the surge is still intensifying or peaking as we reach mid-September (peak office-wear season). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced stockouts for the last 5 periods due to the unexpected magnitude of this seasonal shift, despite large quantities in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). To capture the current peak and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples (N=6) to focus on the high-demand regime, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work demand surge (P26-P31) for 568601006 intensified: mean demand is 269.0 units, with the latest two weeks (P30-P31) averaging 342.5. Stockouts sustained for 5 periods due to regime shift magnitude.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant Fall/Back-to-work demand surge that began in late August (Period 26). The demand mean from Period 26 to Period 32 has risen to 279.3 units, with the last three periods (P30-P32) averaging 342.0 units. Although we have 1,131 units in-transit, the system has suffered stockouts between Periods 27 and 31 due to the rapid regime shift. The most recent demand (P32) was 341 units, showing that demand remains very strong. To prevent further stockouts and capture this high-revenue period, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the start of the surge in P26) to reflect this new mean of ~279. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to reflect the recent high-volume regime ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge (P26-P32) mean calculated at 279.3 units, significantly higher than July lows. Latest 3-period peak (P30-P32) average is 342.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge linked to the late-September 'Back-to-work' transition. Period 33 demand spiked to 612 units, which is nearly double the average (342) observed in the preceding three periods (P30-P32). This indicates the 'Fall surge' has intensified significantly beyond the initial recovery phase. We are currently stocked out (Ending inventory 0). The pipeline remains substantial (1158 units), but given demand reached 612 in a single period, the old regime mean is obsolete. I am shifting to a modern regime (P30-P33) that captures this intensity. The mean of P30-P33 is (357+328+341+612)/4 = 409.5. To protect against further upward spikes in what appears to be a seasonal peak, I'm setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 410 = 2050. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the high volatility of this peak period. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime for Fall 2019: Mean increased from ~280 (P26-P32) to ~410 (P30-P33) as of late September. Peak single-period demand of 612 recorded in P33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak Fall/Back-to-work season. Following the massive demand spike in P33 (612 units), demand in P34 returned to a more sustainable, yet very high level (313 units). The mean demand over the current peak regime (P30-P34) is approximately 390 units per period. The Fall surge regime starting from P26 has a mean of 306 units. Given the transition into October, I expect demand to remain elevated near the 350-400 range before any late-autumn tapering. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 units on-hand and high demand expected, the priority is to maintain inventory to capture high-margin sales ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost). I will use the recent 5-period mean (P30-P34) as the basis for mu_hat to capture the current peak intensity while acknowledging the P33 outlier's influence on volatility.

Carry-over insight: Peak Fall demand regime (P30-P34) mean for 568601006 is 390.2 units. Single-period historical demand peak of 612 units observed in P33.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak Fall/Back-to-work season. Average demand over the most recent 6 periods (P30-P35) is 372.3 units, significantly higher than any previous regime. The latest period (P35) showed a demand of 283, which is a dip from the P33 peak of 612 but still maintains the high-demand regime established in September. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 1917 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. To capture the current seasonal peak while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed since P30 (range 283 to 612), I will use the last 6 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend maintain a high base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in the P27-P31 and P33 windows.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime (P30-P35) confirmed at a mean of 372.3 units. High volatility remains present (Stdev approx 120). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1114.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer (568601006) remains in a high-demand Fall regime, though it has slightly cooled from the P33 peak of 612. The mean demand for the most recent period (P30-P36) is approximately 353 units per period. The on-hand inventory is critically low (14 units) following a period where demand (282) nearly exhausted the arriving shipment (296). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1, the target service level remains high (q=0.8). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility in this peak season (stdev ~110), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current Fall regime mean, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the high variance and prevent stockouts while the in-transit inventory catches up.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime (P30-P36) mean remains around 353 units, showing high volatility but stabilizing below the P33 peak. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1161.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in a high-volume Fall regime (P30-P37), but showing signs of stabilization and potential tapering from the late-September peak. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is 353.6 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P34-P37) show a slightly lower average of 297.8 units, indicating the extreme peak of P33 (612 units) was an outlier. The current on-hand inventory is 91, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 1610 units (including the large P34/P35 orders of 635 and 596 units arriving in P38/P39). Given lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current regime's volume while smoothing the recent volatility. This maintains a robust base stock to protect against stockouts as the large late-season orders arrive, while acknowledging that the absolute peak demand period has likely passed. L=4 remains confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak demand regime (P30-P37) mean stabilized at ~350 units; recent 4-week trend (P34-P37) suggests a slight cooling to ~300 units from the late-September extreme.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1199.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is showing signs of moderate cooling from the late-September peak (P33: 612), but remains strong in the 'Fall/Winter' regime. Recent demand (P34-P38) has averaged 315.2 units, a decrease from the P30-P34 average of 390.2. With Period 39 being early November, we are entering the mid-to-late Fall season. Historical lead time is exceptionally stable at 4 periods (consistent across nearly 35 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 341, and pipeline inventory is 1245 (orders from P35-P38). The total inventory position (1586) covers approximately 5 periods of recent average demand (315 * 5 = 1575). Since the stock-out risk has subsided and we are moving towards the end of the year (P47), I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current 315-unit mean while maintaining a default sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in this category (std remains high). This ensures we maintain a safe stock level without over-ordering as the season progresses.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (P34-P38) average has moderated to 315.2 units, down ~19% from the September peak mean of 390.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (Nov 11), we are observing the late-fall demand profile for the Mariette Blazer. Following a significant peak in September (P33 reached 612 units), demand has moderated. The mean for the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) is 308.4 units, and the mean for the most recent 3 periods (P37-P39) is 309.7 units. This indicates a stabilization around the ~310 mark, cooling from the chaotic peak but remaining significantly higher than summer levels. On-hand inventory is currently high (706 units), and we have 830 units in the pipeline (ordered P36-P39), totaling 1536 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend aims for high service levels. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 (covering P34-P39) to capture the current moderation trend (average ~321) while maintaining enough stock to cover the L+1 window against the moderate volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand cooling confirmed: After the late-Sept peak, demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~310 units (P35-P39 average 308.4) compared to the mid-Sept peak mean of ~390. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a 'cooling' phase following the late-September peak demand period. Analyzing the demand from Period 35 to Period 40, we see a stabilized mean of approximately 300.5 units (P35: 283, P36: 282, P37: 313, P38: 385, P39: 231, P40: 278). The date is November 18, which often precedes the 'Black Friday' and holiday shopping period; however, without a confirmed seasonal trend for this specific SKU in late November, I will conservatively pivot to the recent stabilized mean. On-hand inventory is high (599), and there are 725 units in-transit. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the post-peak stability, and sigma_hat to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. This will likely result in a very small or zero order this period given the high inventory position (on-hand + pipeline = 1324), which is roughly 4.4 periods of coverage at the 300 unit/period rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has clearly entered a stabilization phase following the Fall peak in late September. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 290.4 units, down from the peak mean of 390. This reflects a typical cooling period in late November as the initial back-to-work/fall seasonal surge subsides. Inventory is currently high (on-hand 562 units) due to the large orders placed during the peak arrival. The lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. For Period 42, I am setting L to 'calculate' based on this consistency. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=7 (P35-P41) to capture the current post-peak stabilization level, which averages roughly 266 units per period, ensuring we don't over-order against the now-abundant on-hand stock while still maintaining sufficient pipeline for the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling confirmed: Mean demand from P37-P41 has stabilized at approximately 270 units, a ~30% reduction from the late-September peak. Inventory levels have recovered following peak arrivals.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a significant demand spike of 733 units (Date: 2019/11/25). This aligns with Black Friday week, a major retail event. While this is likely a temporary surge rather than a permanent regime shift, the product (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is entering the winter holiday season (early December). The 'post-peak' cooling noted in previous periods has been interrupted by this event. Given the current date of 2019/12/2, we should anticipate potential secondary holiday surges or 'Cyber Monday' effects. The current on-hand inventory is low (99), but in-transit inventory is high (704), with 181 units from P39 expected to arrive during this period (P43). To manage the transition from the Black Friday spike while ensuring we don't stock out during December, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1450. This is calculated as (L+1) * 290, where 290 represents a weighted expectation between the pre-spike level (~270) and the recent volatility, providing a buffer for remaining December demand. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the increased volatility from the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike of 733 units observed in P42, confirmed as Black Friday seasonal volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 was a significant outlier (733 units), which aligns with Black Friday (late November). Period 43 demand returned to a more moderate level (169 units). For Period 44 (early December), we expect demand to stabilize between the post-peak cooling mean (approx. 270) and pre-holiday levels. Given the proximity to the end of the game (P47), we must be cautious about over-ordering as units ordered now (P44) will arrive in P48 (after the game ends, as lead time is 4). However, the system's pipeline must still cover lead time. Recent demand (P39-P43 excluding the BF spike) averages roughly 230 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak trend and higher volatility from the BF spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Historical demand for this women's blazer showed a massive Black Friday spike in P42 (733 units), followed by a drop in P43 (169 units) and a recovery in P44 (304 units). This suggests significant pre-holiday and holiday volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a large pipeline (1743 units) is in transit. Period 45 will see the arrival of the P41 order (250 units), which may not satisfy current backlogged demand or the immediate P45 demand fully.
