======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer over the last five periods shows a fluctuating but generally upward trend (161, 145, 179, 196, 186), with an average of approximately 173 units. The current date is February 11, 2019. In the fashion retail sector, February typically marks the transition into the Spring/Summer season, where 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Blazers' (like the Mariette Blazer) see increased demand for office wear and transitional styling. Given the most recent three periods (179, 196, 186) show a higher level of demand compared to the start of the training data, and accounting for the seasonal shift into mid-February, I expect demand to remain elevated. The forecast targets a value slightly above the recent moving average to account for the seasonal build-up.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Analysis: The training data (Periods -4 to 0) shows a range of 145-196 with an average of 173.4. 2. Recent Demand: Period 1 (late Feb) recorded 227 units, representing a significant +31% increase over the previous historical average. 3. Seasonal Relevance: The product is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring). Mid-to-late February marks the beginning of the 'Spring/Workwear' season as customers refresh wardrobes for the new season. 4. Trend Analysis: The jump from 186 (Period 0) to 227 (Period 1) suggests a seasonally driven upward momentum. For Period 2 (Feb 18-24), I expect this heightened demand to persist or slightly increase as the spring shopping season gains traction, though I will remain cautious not to over-forecast without further evidence of a sustained peak.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Analysis: The initial training data showed a mean demand of 173 units (min 145, max 196). However, the observed demand in the first two periods of the test phase shows a significant jump to 227 and 284 units respectively. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is late February. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed), this garment is highly relevant for the spring transition and professional/formal occasions typically associated with early spring and graduation/event season. 3. Recent Trends: There is a strong upward momentum (roughly a 25% increase from Period 1 to Period 2). 4. Forecast Logic: I expect the demand to remain elevated compared to historical training data due to the spring seasonal shift, but the rate of growth may begin to stabilize as the initial ramp-up peak is approached. I predict a slight continued increase based on the established upward trend and seasonal relevance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: demand increased from training average of 173 to a test-phase average of 255 (+47%), signaling a strong seasonal ramp-up for spring professional attire.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is a professional 'Womens Tailoring' item, which typically sees high demand during the early spring (February/March) as consumers refresh work wardrobes. Historical training data showed a mean of 173. Recent test data shows a significantly higher but volatile average of 236. Period 1 and 2 showed a strong ramp-up (227, 284), but Period 3 saw a sharp correction to 198. As of March 4th, we are entering a peak retail window. The Carry-over insight suggests a regime shift of +47% over the base 173 (~255 units average). Given the recent dip in Period 3, a moderate rebound is expected as spring shopping picks up momentum, though likely not returning to the Period 2 peak immediately.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand (173 avg) has shifted to a higher regime in the test phase (231 avg) as the spring season begins. Period 2 saw a notable spike (284), followed by a stabilization in Period 3 (198) and Period 4 (214). As of March 11 (Period 5), demand for professional apparel like the Mariette Blazer typically remains strong due to spring wardrobe updates and corporate seasonality. The forecast assumes demand will stabilize slightly above the recent two-week average to reflect the sustained seasonal interest in Blazers during mid-March.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' (professional women's tailoring) showed a training average of 173. Upon entering the test phase in February, a regime shift occurred with demand averaging 228 units over the first five periods (+32%). While Period 2 saw an unusual peak (284), demand has since stabilized into a highly consistent range: Period 3 (198), Period 4 (214), and Period 5 (215). The current date (March 18) aligns with the peak spring shopping season for office wear and professional attire. Given the stabilization and the very slight upward movement from Period 4 to 5, I expect demand to remain in the 215-225 range as seasonal demand holds steady.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173. In the test phase, Period 1 and 2 showed a significant surge (227 and 284), likely due to early spring professional wardrobe shopping. However, from Period 3 onwards, demand has stabilized significantly. The last three periods (4, 5, and 6) have shown remarkable stability at 214-215 units, indicating a plateau in the current demand regime. As the date is March 25, we remain in the peak spring season for 'Dressed' products like blazers, but the immediate momentum has flattened. Given the rigid consistency of 215 units over the last two weeks, I forecast a continuation of this stable trend for Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization observed: Demand has plateaued at ~215 units throughout March (Periods 4-6), moderating the initial February surge.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173 units. In the test phase, demand spiked in February (Avg: 236) before stabilizing in March (Avg for Periods 4-6: 215). However, Period 7 (March 25) saw a notable decline to 186 units. The current date is April 1st. For a 'Mariette Blazer' (professional/dressed tailoring), April typically represents the peak of the Spring/Pre-Easter professional shopping season. The dip in Period 7 is likely a temporary fluctuation rather than a downward trend, as early April often sees a resurgence in 'business casual' and 'event' wear. I expect demand to rebound slightly from the Period 7 low, aligning closer to the established March baseline as shoppers prepare for the post-Easter return to work and spring events.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a baseline of 173 (training phase), which jumped to an average of 255 in the early spring (Periods 1-3). Periods 4-6 showed stabilization around 215. Period 7 saw a dip to 186, followed by a significant rebound in Period 8 (249 units). This rebound aligns with early April, typically a peak time for spring professional wear shopping as temperatures rise and the spring season solidifies. Given the current date of April 8th, we are in a high-demand window for seasonal tailoring. The bounce-back to 249 suggests that the Period 7 dip was an outlier or a temporary lull rather than a downward trend. I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly moderate from the Period 8 spike, settling into a range between the March average (215) and the recent peak (249).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~173. In the test phase, the Mariette Blazer (a professional 'Dressed' item) saw a surge in February (Avg: 236) followed by a stable March plateau (Avg: 215). April has shown increased volatility: Period 8 spiked to 249, likely due to pre-Easter shopping and the start of spring business seasons, while Period 9 dropped to 178, possibly due to a post-spike correction or timing of the Easter holiday (April 21, 2019). Period 10 (April 15) is the week immediately preceding Easter Sunday. Given the product's profile as a 'Dressed' blazer, demand typically strengthens just before a holiday weekend for formal/semi-formal occasions. I expect a rebound from Period 9's low toward the established spring average of ~215, adjusted slightly upward for holiday retail traffic.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. In the test phase, demand for the Mariette Blazer peaked in Feb/early March (Periods 1-6 avg: 225) during the spring professional/workwear ramp-up. However, recent weeks show a notable downward trend: Period 8 (249) was a brief spike (likely start of April/Spring events), but Period 9 (178) and Period 10 (130) show a sharp decline. Period 11 (2019/4/22) is post-Easter/mid-Spring. Given the blazer is a 'Dressed/Fitted jacket', we are likely seeing a seasonal exit or a transition to lighter summer alternatives. The drop from 178 to 130 (-27%) suggests momentum is fading. I expect demand to stabilize or slightly rebound from the sharp Period 10 drop as it nears May, but remain lower than the March average.

Carry-over insight: Downward seasonal trend confirmed: Period 9-10 average (154) is 28% lower than Period 4-7 average (215), indicating the spring peak has passed for this specific blazer SKU.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear peak in February/March (averaging ~215-220 units) followed by a confirmed downward trend in April. Recent demand for Period 10 (130) and Period 11 (127) indicates the product has transitioned into a lower-demand regime as the spring professional shopping season winds down. Period 12 (April 29) sits at the start of a week containing May Day (May 1st), which in many retail markets can provide a minor temporary lift or stabilization, but doesn't typically reverse a seasonal decline for tailored blazers. Given the stabilization between Period 10 and 11, I expect demand to remain relatively flat or slightly lower, aligning with the late spring trailing edge.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal peak in February/March (averaging ~215-225), followed by a significant decline as the spring season naturally transitions. Periods 10 and 11 reached lows of ~128. However, Period 12 (April 29) saw a sharp bounce back to 191 units. Since the current date is May 6, 2019, this aligns with consumers preparing for May events such as graduation ceremonies, spring weddings, and professional transitions. While the 'Carry-over Insights' noted a downward trend, Period 12 suggests a local secondary peak. I expect Period 13 to remain relatively high compared to the late-April lows, though likely slightly lower than the immediate pre-event surge of Period 12 as the peak purchasing window for early May events closes.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Tailoring' blazer showed a peak in February/March (Period 1-6 avg: ~225) followed by a notable decline entering April. Recent performance in May (Periods 12-13) shows a slight recovery from the late-April lows (Period 10-11 avg: 128), averaging 175 units over the last two weeks. The date (May 13) correlates with the transition from peak spring office-wear demand into early summer, where demand typically stabilizes at a lower baseline than the initial spring ramp-up. Given the recent average of 175 and a slight downward step from Period 12 to 13, I expect demand to settle around the mid-150s as the seasonal peak continues to recede.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this professional blazer peaked in late February and March (average ~215-220 units) and saw a significant decline through April as the spring transition concluded. However, recent data from the last three periods (12-14) shows a modest recovery and stabilization, with an average of 182 units (Period 12: 191, Period 13: 160, Period 14: 196). This suggests a 'secondary plateau' or late-spring demand before summer sets in. Given the current date (May 20), we are approaching the end of the spring retail season. The increase to 196 in Period 14 suggests some volatility or a minor promotional lift, but the overall trend since Period 11 has moved from 127 up to a steadier range. I expect demand to remain relatively stable but slightly moderate as May progresses.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization after seasonal decline: Demand has recovered from the April low (avg 128) to a new late-spring average of 182 units over Periods 12-14 (+42% from the trough).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU shows significant sensitivity to seasonality and specific retail dates. Following the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights (Periods 12-14), Period 15 showed a dip to 143 units. The current date (May 27) corresponds with Memorial Day in the US, which often triggers promotional activity and increased shopping for professional/smart-casual attire as the summer season begins. Recent demand has fluctuated between 143 and 196, with a three-period average (P13-P15) of 166 units. Given the holiday timing and the nature of the product (a versatile fitted blazer), I anticipate a modest uptick from the most recent observation as consumers shop holiday sales, though staying within the established late-spring range.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows high volatility but clear seasonal cycles. We observed a spring peak (Feb/Mar avg ~215), a significant April slump (avg ~130), and a stabilization in May (avg ~172). For the current date (June 3), we are entering the summer season. Looking at the last three periods (P14: 196, P15: 143, P16: 168), the average is 169. June typically sees a slight softening in 'Womens Tailoring' as demand shifts toward lighter summer apparel, but stable business and 'Dressed' attire remains necessary for office environments. Given the recent recovery from the April trough and the slight downward move in P15-P16 compared to P14, I expect demand to remain within the 150-170 range. I will forecast a slight decrease to 160, reflecting the transition into the summer slump where formal blazers lose some seasonal momentum.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer, a lined professional garment, shows a clear decline as the season moves into June. After a late-spring recovery (Periods 12-14 average: 182), demand has dropped significantly over the last three periods (143, 168, 118), resulting in a three-period average of 143 units. The most recent observation (Period 17: 118) is the lowest demand point in the series, signaling a transition into the low-demand summer season for tailored outerwear. My forecast anticipates a slight stabilization near this new floor but maintains the downward trajectory associated with warming weather.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand contraction: Average demand has decreased from 182 (Periods 12-14) to 143 (Periods 15-17), a 21% reduction as the season transitions into early June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal transition for the Mariette Blazer. After a spring recovery peak in May (Avg: 182), demand has entered a summer contraction phase in late May and early June. The average demand across Periods 15-18 is 142 units, which is a 22% decrease from the previous level. Recent observations (Period 17: 118, Period 18: 139) confirm this lower demand regime as the weather warms, reducing the immediate utility for woven tailoring. Given the mid-June date and the absence of immediate retail drivers for formal blazers, I expect demand to remain stable within this lower summer range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern for this professional blazer. After a spring peak and a brief late-spring recovery (Periods 12-14), demand has entered a sustained summer contraction phase. The demand for the most recent period (122) and the three-period average (P17-19: 126) is significantly lower than the preceding phase (P12-14: 182). Specifically, the last three periods show a consistent low-range behavior (118, 139, 122). As we move into late June (6/24), demand typically softens for 'Dressed' tailored blazers due to warmer weather and vacation seasonality. Given the current trend, the forecast anticipates a slight continuation of this lower-volume regime, hovering around the recent mean of ~126.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer low-regime: Periods 17-19 average demand (126 units) represents a 31% decrease from the late-spring average (182), reflecting seasonal cooling for tailored outerwear in summer.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:

Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal contraction for the Mariette Blazer as summer progresses. After a late-spring recovery (Periods 12-14 avg: 182), demand entered a downward trajectory in June (Periods 15-19 avg: 138). Period 20 (late June) saw a sharp drop to 73 units, representing a 40% decline from the average of the two preceding weeks (P18-19 avg: 130.5). Entering July (Period 21), demand for professional tailored outerwear typically hits a seasonal trough due to high temperatures and the peak summer holiday period. The forecast assumes demand will remain near this new lower floor established in Period 20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) has shown a clear downward seasonal progression from a spring peak of ~215 units to a summer low. Most recently, the demand has entered a confirmed low-regime. Period 20 (73 units) and Period 21 (116 units) average 94.5 units, which is a significant drop compared to the previous June average of ~126 units (Periods 17-19). July is typically a slow month for 'Dressed' tailored blazers as focus shifts to summer leisure wear and clearance cycles. Given the slight recovery in P21 from the P20 outlier, I expect demand to stabilize around the current low-regime mean, likely between 100-110 units, as we are in the depths of the summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer trough confirmed: Periods 19-21 average demand dropped to 104 units, a 17% decrease from the early June average (126), establishing a new seasonal low-water mark for the product.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the Mariette Blazer has entered a summer trough. The carry-over insight from Period 22 identified a mid-summer low-regime with an average of 104 units over Periods 19-21. However, the most recent data (Periods 21 and 22) show a slight recovery/stabilization at 116 and 120 units respectively, coming off the seasonal low of 73 units in Period 20. Given the date is mid-July (2019/7/15), we are at the peak of summer where demand for lined tailored blazers typically remains depressed before the late-summer/pre-fall refresh. I expect demand to remain relatively flat and consistent with the most recent two-week average (~118 units) as the product stays in its seasonal low-regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows a clear seasonal pattern with a peak in spring followed by a steady decline as summer progresses. The carry-over insights correctly identified a mid-summer trough. Looking at the most recent data (Periods 21-23), demand has stabilized at a low level: 116, 120, and 120 units respectively, averaging 118.6 units. This indicates the floor of the seasonal trough has likely been reached in mid-July. As we enter the week of 2019/07/22 (Period 24), we are nearing the end of July. While retail often begins to see early 'Back to School' or 'Pre-Fall' interest for tailoring in late August, it is too early for a significant recovery in July. Given the exact stability of the last two periods (120 units), I expect demand to remain flat or very slightly fluctuate around this new baseline.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization at seasonal floor: Periods 21-23 demand has flattened to an average of ~119 units, ending the downward trend observed since June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the product has been through a significant seasonal decline from its spring peaks (avg ~215) to a summer trough. Previous carry-over insights noted a stabilization at a 'seasonal floor' of ~119 units (Periods 21-23). However, Period 24 (July 22nd) shows a sharp drop to 63 units, mirroring the sudden dip seen in Period 20 (73 units). These intermittent sharp drops likely represent late-summer clearance volatility or low-stock variability rather than a new sustained floor. Given the date (July 29th) is the peak of the summer clearance period before the 'Back-to-Business' autumn transition begins, demand is expected to remain low but likely bounce back slightly from the specific low of Period 24 towards the recent average. I am forecasting a slight recovery towards the established summer floor while acknowledging the continued seasonal weakness for a lined blazer in late July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer peaked in the spring (averaging ~210 units) before entering a long summer contraction. Recent data identifies a significant trough in the late July period, specifically Period 24 (63 units) and Period 25 (94 units). These figures are below the previous 'seasonal floor' of ~119 units observed in early July. As of August 5th (Period 26), we anticipate the beginning of a 'Back-to-Office' transition. The demand reflects a recovery trend from the Period 24 low (+49% in Period 25). I forecast a continued moderate increase as the market prepares for late summer/early autumn professional attire needs, aiming for a return toward the 110-120 unit range.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is entering a seasonal 'Back-to-Work' recovery phase. After hitting a summer floor in July (avg ~101 for Periods 21-24), demand has risen consistently for three consecutive weeks (63 to 94 to 146), signaling a clear upward trend. Mid-August traditionally sees a spike in tailoring demand as consumers prepare for the autumn professional season. Given the momentum of +52 units in the most recent period and the transition toward peak fall levels seen in the training data (avg 173), I expect demand to continue climbing toward the 170-180 range.

Carry-over insight: New upward trend confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (63 to 94 to 146), marking the start of the 'Back-to-Work' autumn seasonal recovery from the summer trough.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear 'Back-to-Business' seasonal recovery starting in late July. Demand has surged over the last four periods: 63 -> 94 -> 146 -> 301. The most recent demand (301) represents a significant jump, effectively doubling the previous week's volume. This reflects the mid-August peak when consumers refresh work wardrobes (blazers) for the autumn season. While 301 is the highest observed demand in the test phase, the current date (August 19) is squarely in the peak back-to-work shopping window. I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially stabilize or slightly pull back from the very sharp spike seen in Period 27, as growth rates this steep (100% week-over-week) are rarely sustainable for long periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant 'Back-to-Work' acceleration: Period 27 demand (301) is 153% higher than the Period 24-26 average (101), confirming a high-intensity seasonal peak for tailoring in mid-August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing a sharp 'Back-to-Work' seasonal peak. Historical demand surged from a Period 24-26 average of 101 to 301 in Period 27 (+198%) and remained high at 251 in Period 28. This pattern mirrors the spring professional peak observed in Period 2 (284). As we move into the final week of August (Period 29: 2019/8/26), the initial high-intensity surge typically begins to normalize as the primary wardrobe-refresh window closes, while remaining significantly above the summer baseline. Expecting a slight deceleration from Period 28 while maintaining the high-volume regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant 'Back-to-Work' demand spike starting in mid-August (Period 27: 301 units). However, the demand has been gradually decelerating over the last three weeks (301 -> 251 -> 231). For Period 30 (2019/9/2), we are entering early September, which typically sees sustained demand for professional tailoring (Mariette Blazer), but often moves away from the initial peak surge as consumers complete their primary autumn shopping. Given the stabilization trend (average of 241 over the last two weeks) and the slight downward trajectory from the Period 27 peak, I expect a moderate further cooling as the market settles into a post-launch seasonal rhythm. The forecast logic weights the recent average of ~241 units with the downward trend, targeting a slightly lower volume.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Following the mid-August 'Back-to-Work' surge (301 units), demand has settled into a new high-autumn range averaging 241 units (Periods 28-29), a 100%+ increase over July levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong autumn recovery starting in Period 27. The most recent observation (Period 30) showed a significant spike to 357 units, which aligns with early September 'Back-to-Work' peaks for professional tailoring like this Mariette Blazer. However, Period 27 also showed a sharp spike (301) followed by a two-period cooling phase (251, 231) before the next surge. Given that Period 30 (Sept 2) likely captured the primary seasonal rush, a slight moderation is expected for Period 31 (Sept 9), though demand should remain well above the August average (241) as the high-autumn season continues.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand over Periods 27-30 (285 units) is 182% higher than the summer floor (101 units), establishing a new seasonal baseline for the autumn peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The 'Back-to-Work' autumn seasonal peak is firmly established. Historical demand for the last five periods (P27-P31) has averaged 294 units, a significant jump from the summer floor of ~119. Recent demand peaked at 357 in Period 30 and remained strong at 328 in Period 31. This suggests the initial peak may be slightly cooling but demand remains in a high-sustained regime for mid-September, a prime period for professional tailoring. I expect demand to remain elevated but show a slight natural cooling from the Labor Day/early September surge, targeting the 310-320 range.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a strong autumn 'Back-to-Work' regime. Demand surged in mid-August (Period 27: 301) and has established a sustained high-demand baseline. Over the last three periods (30-32), the average demand is 342 units, which is significantly higher than the initial autumn surge average of 261 (Periods 27-29). September consistently shows high demand for this tailored blazer. Given the slight upward trend in the most recent three weeks (357, 328, 341), demand is expected to remain robust near the 340-unit level as we move through late September.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Average demand for Periods 30-32 (342 units) represents a 31% increase over the initial Period 27-29 'Back-to-Work' average (261 units), confirming peak seasonal demand for tailoring.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant escalation in demand for this blazer SKU since mid-August, aligning with the autumn 'Back-to-Work' season. After stabilizing in the 330-350 range for Periods 30-32, Period 33 experienced a dramatic surge to 612 units. This spike likely represents a specific promotional event or a peak seasonal buying moment as late September transitions into October. While the overall autumn demand regime remains very strong (3.4x higher than the summer floor), a massive single-period jump of 80% above the previous baseline typically faces a correction in the subsequent week. The forecast assumes demand will retreat from the extreme 612 peak but remain at an elevated level consistent with the high-autumn regime observed in Periods 30-32.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand surge in Period 33: Demand increased to 612 units, a 79% jump from the Period 30-32 average (342), marking the highest observed volume for the SKU and confirming a volatile high-intensity peak in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong autumn peak for this blazer. Demand surged in late September (Period 33) to 612 units, followed by a significant correction in Period 34 (313 units). Period 34 demand is consistent with the pre-surge average for Periods 30-32 (342 units). As of October 7th, we are moving past the secondary 'Back-to-Work' peak that follows the August surge. Analysis suggests that the 612 units was a single-week anomaly or high-intensity flash peak. We expect demand to continue normalizing towards the high-autumn baseline established in September (avg ~330-350) or slightly lower as the immediate peak seasonal urgency subsides.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals that SKU 568601006 experienced a massive peak in late September (Period 33: 612 units). Following this peak, demand has returned to a more sustainable autumn regime of approximately 280-315 units. Specifically, Period 34 (313) and Period 35 (283) show a contraction and stabilization after the outlier-level high. The average of the most recent two periods is 298. Moving into mid-October (2019/10/14), professional tailoring products typically remain in high demand before the holiday transition, but the extreme peak observed in September is clearly tapering off. The forecast anticipates a slight continued softening as the initial 'Back-to-Work/Autumn' rush subsides, targeting the lower end of the current 280-330 range.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major 'Back-to-Work' autumn surge which peaked in late September (Period 33 at 612 units). Following this peak, demand has entered a stabilization phase across Periods 34-36, with observations of 313, 283, and 282 units. This indicates a consistent plateau at a high-autumn baseline of approximately 283 units. For the current date (October 21), demand is expected to remain steady as it is post-peak but still within the core professional/tailoring season before the holiday transition. The forecast weights the most recent two weeks heavily, as they show very low variance (283 and 282).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization: Demand has flattened at a new baseline of ~283 units over Periods 35-36, following the extreme volatility of late September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) exhibits strong seasonality. After the extreme peak in late September (Period 33, 612 units), demand stabilized around a new baseline (~283 units). The most recent historical data shows demand values of 283 (P35), 282 (P36), and 313 (P37). Current date (2019/10/28) is late October, moving into the 'Mid-Season' phase where professional tailoring typically maintains steady demand before the holiday season. The recent average (293 units over the last three periods) suggests a stable high-autumn regime. I expect a slight uptick or maintenance of current levels as shoppers prepare for November office settings and mid-season events.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant recovery and peak during the autumn 'Back-to-Work' season (Periods 27-33), followed by a brief stabilization near 280 units (Periods 34-36). Recently, demand has exhibited a renewed upward trajectory, increasing from 313 in Period 37 to 385 in Period 38. With the current date moving into early November, we are likely entering the pre-holiday promotional ramp-up. Given the strong momentum of a 23% increase in the last period, I expect demand to continue climbing toward the 400+ unit range while remaining below the late-September outlier of 612.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for Periods 37-39 (313, 385, 231) shows a significant recent fluctuation, likely influenced by the lead-up to the mid-November sales period. While Period 38 saw a spike, Period 39 experienced a 40% decline, which suggests a temporary cooling or a 'lull before the storm' of major late-November retail events (Black Friday preparatory shopping). The product, a Mariette Blazer, remains highly relevant for autumn business wear. Considering the 'Post-peak stabilization' insight from Period 37 (baseline ~283) and the average of the last three periods (~310), the forecast anticipates a slight recovery from the Period 39 dip as demand stabilizes ahead of late-November peaks. I am forecasting a return toward the autumn baseline average.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' exited its late September peak (Period 33) and stabilized around a baseline of 280-300 units from Period 35-37. In recent periods (38-40), demand has stayed within this range, averaging 298 units, despite a brief uptick followed by a dip. As the current date is November 18 (Period 41), we are entering the pre-Black Friday/pre-holiday window. In many retail environments, the week immediately preceding major sales events often shows a slight hold in demand or steady baseline as consumers anticipate promotions. Given the recent average of 298 (Periods 38-40) and the previous regime baseline of 283 (Periods 35-36), I forecast a continued steady state around the 280-300 mark before any potential holiday spikes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a late-autumn/winter period where demand has stabilized following the extreme late-September peak (612 units). Over the last three weeks (Periods 39-41), demand has averaged 251 units (231, 278, 245), representing a clear step down from the October average of ~315 units. The Current Date is November 25, 2019, which is the start of Black Friday week (November 29). Historically, retail demand for apparel often sees a significant lift during this period due to heavy promotions. While the recent three-week trend suggests a baseline around 250, I anticipate a promotional spike for the upcoming week, similar in magnitude to the relative lifts seen in previous periods of high activity, though moderated compared to the late-September peak. My forecast reflects a baseline of ~250 plus a 20-25% Black Friday uplift.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant and repeated pattern of demand spikes around key retail calendar events for this SKU. Most recently, Period 42 (Nov 25) saw demand surge to 733 units (+199% compared to the prior three-period average of 251), which aligns perfectly with Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional activities. Period 43 (Dec 2) captures the immediate aftermath of Cyber Monday and the transition into early December holiday shopping. While demand typically retreats from extreme promotional peaks (like the 733 units seen in Period 42), the product ('fitted jacket in woven fabric') remains highly relevant for winter festivities and holiday office parties. Looking at the post-autumn-peak baseline (Periods 34-41), demand has averaged approximately 290 units. I anticipate a significant correction from the Black Friday peak but expect demand to remain elevated above the standard autumn baseline due to the start of the holiday gifting and dressing season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Black Friday surge confirmed: Period 42 demand (733) represents a 192% increase over the preceding 4-period average (251), establishing a clear late-November peak for the SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand indicates a baseline average of approximately 250 units during the non-promotional autumn period (Periods 39-41). Period 42 saw a major peak (733 units) due to Black Friday, followed by a significant 'hangover' drop in Period 43 (169 units). For Period 44 (December 9), demand is expected to recover from the post-Black Friday trough as holiday shopping for December social events and 'dressed' office wear resumes. Based on the previous autumn stabilization levels and reflecting a typical mid-December recovery, the forecast projects a return toward the 220-240 unit range.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a high-intensity demand spike during Period 42 (Black Friday week) at 733 units, followed by a typical post-peak retraction to 169 in Period 43. Period 44 (Dec 9) shows a significant recovery to 304 units (+80% week-over-week), which aligns with mid-December holiday shopping patterns and preparation for festive events/New Year's Eve. Given the current date is Dec 16 (Period 45), we are entering the final high-demand week before the Christmas holiday. For a structured blazer suitable for holiday dressing, demand is expected to remain elevated or slightly increase compared to the previous week (Period 44) but remain well below the artificial Black Friday peak. The forecast assumes the upward momentum from Period 43 to 44 will continue for one more week before the typical end-of-year deceleration.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the Black Friday peak (733 units) and subsequent crash (169 units), demand recovered to 304 and then stabilized at 258. The current period (Period 46, Dec 23) covers the week of Christmas. While post-Christmas clearance sales (Boxing Day) typically drive volume for staples like blazers, the first half of the week usually sees a significant decline in professional/tailored attire demand due to holiday closures and a primary consumer focus on festive/gift items rather than office wear. Given the decline from 304 to 258 in the previous period and the impact of holiday business closures, I anticipate a further seasonal dip before the January 'Fresh Start' recovery.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a significant peak in late November (733 units for Period 42, Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Following this peak, demand decelerated into December: Period 44 (304), Period 45 (258), and Period 46 (128). The sharp drop to 128 units in Period 46 reflects the pre-Christmas/Christmas week lull where consumer focus shifts away from professional tailoring. For Period 47 (Dec 30), we anticipate a minor recovery driven by post-holiday clearance sales and early preparation for the new year ('Back-to-Work' sentiment), though it remains well below autumn peaks. Based on the stabilization seen in previous troughs (e.g., Periods 10-11 or 24-25), a modest rebound from the holiday week low is expected.
