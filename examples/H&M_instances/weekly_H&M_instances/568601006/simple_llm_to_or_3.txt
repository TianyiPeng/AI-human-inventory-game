SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last 5 periods has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend, averaging 173.4 units (161, 145, 179, 196, 186). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is February 11, 2019. This is the lead-up to the Spring season. As the 'Mariette Blazer' is a 'Womens Tailoring' item often used for workwear or transitional layering, demand typically increases in mid-February as consumers refresh their professional wardrobes for Spring. 3. Recent Trend: The last three periods (179, 196, 186) show a higher baseline compared to the first two (161, 145), indicating growing momentum. 4. Final Forecast: Expecting a slight increase due to the seasonal transition and the established upward trajectory from the training data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data shows stable demand with an average of 173.4 units (range 145-196). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is February 18th. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), which typically sees increased demand during the spring transition as customers refresh workwear and formal wardrobes. 3. Recent Trend: Period 1 (Feb 11) showed a significant jump to 227 units, which is a 30.9% increase over the training average and exceeds the previous max of 196. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the start of the spring season for professional attire and the strong momentum from Period 1, I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly increase as the season gains traction. I will forecast a slight increase from the last observed point.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The initial training data showed a stable range of 145-196 units. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: February marks the transition into the Spring/Summer fashion season. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this item is a staple for professional spring wardrobes and transitional weather. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: There is a significant upward shift in demand in the last two periods. Demand jumped from an average of ~173 in training to 227 (Period 1) and 284 (Period 2), indicating a strong seasonal acceleration as we move deeper into February. 4. Forecast Logic: Period 2 showed a 25% increase over Period 1. Given the date (Feb 25) is the final week of February heading into March, demand is expected to remain high or continue its upward trajectory as spring shopping peaks. Predicting 320 units to account for continued seasonal momentum.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data (Periods -4 to 0) showed an average demand of 173.4. Recent test data (Periods 1-3) shows a significant level shift upward, averaging 236.3 units, representing a ~36% increase in baseline demand. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. This coincides with the start of the spring fashion season. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this item is highly relevant for 'New Season' transitions and professional spring wardrobes. 3. Recent Trend: We saw a peak in Period 2 (284) followed by a correction in Period 3 (198). However, the Period 3 value remains well above the original training average, suggesting a sustained higher plateau rather than a return to old levels. 4. Logic: Expecting demand to stabilize between the recent low (198) and the recent average (236) as the initial spring launch surge levels out. Predicting 225 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: Baseline increased from ~173 to ~236 (+36%) coinciding with Spring season transition.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) shows a significant shift in early Spring. The training period averaged 173 units. Since Period 1 of the test phase (mid-February), the mean has increased to approximately 231 units, representing a sustained +33% growth as the season transitions into Spring. The product is a 'Dressed' blazer, highly relevant for professional wear and spring events. Recent demand (Periods 1-4) shows some volatility (227, 284, 198, 214) but maintains a higher baseline than the training data. Given the date (March 11th) is well into the spring retail cycle, I expect demand to remain stable around the current average. I am forecasting 225 units, slightly above the most recent observation to account for the established spring baseline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged ~173. In the test phase (Periods 1-5), demand shifted upward to an average of ~228. After a significant spike in Period 2 (284), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (198, 214, 215), averaging 209 units. Given the mid-March date (2019/03/18), the product (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak seasonal relevance for spring workwear. The forecast assumes a continuation of the recent stable plateau with a slight upward adjustment for seasonal momentum.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data averaged ~173 units. Since Period 1, there has been a significant upward shift to a higher baseline. 2. Seasonal Considerations: Late March (current date 2019/3/25) aligns with peak Spring demand for women's tailoring and blazers as consumers transition their professional wardrobes. 3. Recent Trend: After a period of high volatility (P1-P3), the demand has shown remarkable stability over the last three periods (P4: 214, P5: 215, P6: 215). 4. Forecast Logic: Given the near-identical demand in the last three weeks and the product's continued seasonal relevance, I am forecasting demand to remain at this stabilized level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The training period average was ~173. Following the transition to the Spring season (starting Period 1), demand shifted upward. Over the last seven periods, the average demand has been approximately 220 units. However, more recent data (Periods 4-7) shows a stabilization at a slightly lower level, averaging 207.5 units. The most recent observation (Period 7: 186) indicates a potential softening from the mid-March plateau of 215. For Period 8 (April 1st), demand for a blazer is expected to remain consistent with this stabilized Spring baseline. I am forecasting a slight recovery from the Period 7 dip, centering on the recent 4-period average.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a consistent performance within the Spring season. Analyzing the test phase (Periods 1-8), the average demand is approximately 223 units. Recent data shows a slight dip in Period 7 (186) followed by a strong recovery in Period 8 (249), which corresponds to the start of April. A fitted blazer is a staple for spring professional and 'dressed' wardrobes, particularly as temperatures rise in early April. The average for the last four periods (Periods 5-8) is 216 units. Given the recent rebound to 249 and the typical demand drive for 'Womens Tailoring' as the mid-spring season solidifies, the forecast anticipates demand to remain slightly above the recent moving average but stabilize from the Period 8 spike.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand for the test phase (Periods 1-9) is approximately 218 units, compared to the training baseline of 173, confirming the carry-over insight of a sustained increase for the spring season. Recent demand has been volatile, with a high of 249 in Period 8 followed by a drop to 178 in Period 9. Period 10 (starting 2019/04/15) is the week leading up to Easter Sunday (April 21). As a 'Dressed' blazer and 'Womens Tailoring' item, this product is highly susceptible to seasonal spikes for spring holidays and formal occasions. I expect a significant rebound from the Period 9 dip as consumers complete holiday purchases, likely returning demand toward the seasonal average of ~220.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed an initial spring surge in Periods 1-6 (avg ~225), significantly higher than the training average of 173. However, recent demand has entered a downward trajectory. Period 8 (249) likely represented a pre-Easter peak for tailored blazers. Since then, demand has dropped sharply in Period 9 (178) and Period 10 (130), the latter coinciding with the Easter holiday week. Period 11 (starting April 22) is the immediate post-Easter week, where demand for 'Dressed' tailoring typically remains low as the holiday shopping cycle concludes and weather continues to warm. I expect demand to stabilize slightly from the Period 10 trough but remain significantly below the earlier spring baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong early Spring performance (Periods 1-8) with an average demand of ~224. However, a significant downward shift has occurred starting Period 9 (178 units) and accelerating in Period 10 (130 units) and Period 11 (127 units). This decline coincides with the post-Easter period and the transition into late April/early May, where demand for structured woven blazers typically softens as temperatures rise. The last two periods show stabilization around the 127-130 range. Given this established trend and seasonal cooling for this product category, the forecast for Period 12 expects demand to remain at this new lower baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Late Spring decline confirmed starting Period 9. Average demand decreased from ~224 (P1-P8) to ~145 (P9-P11), representing a ~35% drop as the peak Spring season concludes.

Predicted demand: 125 units

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong start for the Mariette Blazer (average ~224 units in P1-P8) followed by a significant downturn as the peak spring season tapered off (average ~145 in P9-P11). However, Period 12 (Apr 29) saw a sharp rebound to 191 units. This spike is likely attributed to pre-holiday demand or seasonal events (e.g., preparations for May Day/Labor Day celebrations in early May). For Period 13 (May 6), we are entering a post-holiday week where demand typically stabilizes or slightly softens from a temporary spike. Given the recent average of 149 units over the last 4 weeks (P9-P12) and the specific jump to 191, I expect demand to settle between the low (127) and the high (191) as the secondary spring peak plateaus.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows an initial high-demand period (P1-P8) averaging ~224 units during the peak Spring season. A downward shift was noted starting P9 (averaging ~145 in P9-P11). However, P12 and P13 have shown a slight recovery (191 and 160 respectively) with an average of 175.5. The product is a Mariette Blazer (Women's Tailoring), which is suitable for transitional spring/summer office wear. The current date (May 13) is post-Easter but moving towards late Spring/early Summer. While the P12 spike was significant, P13 showed a decline. Given the previous regime shift to a lower average and the recent volatility, I expect demand to stabilize between the recent high (191) and the low (127). The moving average of the last 4 periods is 152, but given the blazer's seasonal relevance in May, I am forecasting a slight stabilization around the 155-165 range.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed) showed a significant drop in mid-April (Periods 10-11) as noted in the Carry-over Insights. However, since Period 12 (late April/early May), there has been a notable recovery: demand rose from 127 to 191, then settled at 160 and 196. This recent 3-period average is approximately 182 units. The current date is May 20th, a period often associated with spring events and professional wardrobe updates before the summer lull. Given the upward trajectory from the Period 10/11 lows and the most recent observation of 196, demand appears to be stabilizing in a new range of 160-200. I expect demand to remain strong but slightly level off as we approach late May.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Post-April slump, average demand for Periods 12-14 increased to 182 units (+25% vs P9-P11 average of 145).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a volatile but distinct pattern for this blazer. After a significant demand slump in mid-April (P9-P11 average of 145), a recovery was observed in P12-P14 (average 182). However, P15 saw a drop back to 143. The current date (May 27) marks the transition from late Spring to early Summer. Blazers, as mid-weight tailored garments, typically face a seasonal headwind as temperatures rise in June. The average demand for the most recent 4-week block (P12-P15) is 172.5, which aligns closely with the long-term training baseline of 173. Given the recent zig-zag volatility (191, 160, 196, 143), the forecast expects a slight regression toward the recent mean while acknowledging the downward pressure of the upcoming summer season.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a historical pattern of fluctuations. After a confirmed recovery in Periods 12-14 (average ~182), the most recent two weeks (P15-16) have seen a slight cooling, averaging 155.5 units. As of early June (Period 17), demand for tailored blazers typically stabilizes before the peak summer slowdown. The demand in Period 16 (168) shows a partial rebound from Period 15 (143). Given the recent trend and the product's seasonal relevance for early June events and professional wear, the forecast weights the recent average and the slight upward movement from the previous week, targeting a value near the mid-point of the recent recovery and the late-May dip.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer has shown distinct seasonal behavior. After an initial Spring peak (P1-P8: avg ~224) and a subsequent dip (P9-P11: avg ~145), a brief recovery occurred in Periods 12-14 (avg ~182). However, as we enter June, demand has softened significantly again. The last three periods (P15-P17) show a downward trend with values of 143, 168, and 118 (avg ~143). Period 17's demand of 118 is the lowest recorded, signaling a likely 'Summer slump' as the weather warms and demand for tailoring/blazers typically decreases. For Period 18, I expect demand to remain low, slightly rebounding from the P17 trough but staying within the recent lower-bound regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline confirmed starting Period 15: Average demand decreased from 182 (P12-P14) to 143 (P15-P17), a ~21% reduction as the season transitions into summer.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a series of regime shifts linked to seasonal transitions for the Mariette Blazer (a tailored item). After a peak in early Spring (Avg ~224), demand dropped in late April (Avg ~145), recovered briefly in May (Avg ~182), and has recently entered a summer decline phase starting Period 15. The demand for the last four periods (P15-P18) was 143, 168, 118, and 139, resulting in a recent average of approximately 142 units. The most recent data point (139) is consistent with this lower summer baseline. As of June 17, we are in the middle of the summer retail season where interest in tailored blazers typically remains lower compared to the Spring professional/event season. The forecast logic weights the most recent average (142) and the latest data point (139) while acknowledging the stable, lower-demand regime established in the previous period's carry-over insight.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a summer decline phase, as previously noted in the carry-over insights. Looking at the most recent five periods (P15-P19), the demand has fluctuated between 118 and 168 with an average of approximately 138 units. More specifically, the last three periods (P17-P19) show a lower cluster of 118, 139, and 122, averaging 126 units. As we are now in late June (2019/06/24), demand for structured tailoring like blazers typically remains low or continues to dip as consumers prioritize summer-specific apparel. Based on the recent three-week trend and the seasonal context, I expect demand for Period 20 to remain in the 120-130 range.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals a volatile but generally declining trend as the season transitions from Spring to Summer. The previous carry-over insight noted a decline starting in Period 15 (avg 143). Recent data for Periods 18-20 (139, 122, 73) shows a further sharp acceleration of this downward trend. Period 20's demand of 73 units represents a significant 40% drop from Period 19, likely coinciding with the onset of the peak summer vacation season (July 1st) and reduced relevance for heavy woven blazers. My forecast anticipates demand stabilizing at this lower summer baseline, slightly recovering from the sharp P20 drop but remaining well below the June average.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline confirmed starting Period 18: Average demand decreased from 143 (P15-P17) to 111 (P18-P20), a ~22% reduction, with a notable sharp drop to 73 in Period 20 marking the start of the summer trough.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal decline for the Mariette Blazer as we entered the summer months. Demand dropped from a mid-season average of 143 (P15-P17) to a lower regime starting in P18. The most recent data (P18-P21) shows an average demand of 112.5 units, including a sharp trough of 73 units in P20 and a partial recovery to 116 in P21. Given the date (July 8th), we are in the peak of the summer low season for tailoring. The forecast assumes demand will stabilize near the current four-period average (~113) rather than returning to spring levels, as there is no seasonal catalyst for a blazer demand spike in mid-July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history shows a clear seasonal pattern for the Mariette Blazer, with a peak in early spring (Avg ~224 for P1-P8) followed by a gradual decline as summer approached. A significant trough was reached in Period 20 (73 units). However, the last two periods (P21: 116, P22: 120) indicate that demand has stabilized and is recovering slightly from that extreme low. As we are currently in mid-July (2019/7/15), we are still in the summer trough, but the data suggests a consistent baseline around 115-120 units before any potential 'back-to-work' late-summer surge. Given the slight upward movement in the most recent two weeks, a forecast of 124 units is projected for Period 23.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized over the last three periods (P21-P23) with observations of 116, 120, and 120 units respectively. This follows a volatile transition into the summer season, which saw a sharp dip to 73 in P20. The current average of ~119 units represents a stable, low-demand baseline characteristic of the peak summer trough for structured tailoring. Given the high consistency over the last two weeks (exactly 120 units) and no major calendar drivers for late July (P24), the forecast assumes a continuation of this stable baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is a tailored professional garment that typically experiences lower demand during high summer (late July/August) due to vacation periods and warmer weather. Looking at the most recent demand sequence (P21: 116, P22: 120, P23: 120, P24: 63), we see a relatively stable low baseline that sharply dropped in the most recent period. The average of the last four periods is 105, but the significant drop to 63 in Period 24 suggests a further seasonal trough as we enter late July/early August. However, Period 24 (63) is likely a local minimum. Given the historical trend where demand fluctuates around a lower mean during this summer regime, the forecast accounts for a slight correction from the sharp drop in P24 while remaining well below the Spring/Early Summer averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 21: Average demand has stabilized at a lower summer baseline of ~105 units (P21-P24), a further reduction from the previous period's average of 111, with high volatility (range 63-120).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is a tailoring item that has been in a summer demand trough throughout July (Periods 21-25), with an average demand of approximately 103 units, down from the Spring peak of ~224. Recent observations show high volatility, with demand dropping to 63 in Period 24 before recovering to 94 in Period 25. As of August 5th (Period 26), we are entering the 'Back-to-Work' and pre-fall transition period. While a significant seasonal surge is expected later in the month, the immediate forecast predicts a stabilization and slight upward correction toward the established summer baseline of ~105-115 units as interest in tailoring begins to rebuild from its July lows.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern. After a peak in early spring (March/April), demand declined through the summer months, reaching a low baseline of approximately 105 units. However, recent data (Period 26: 146 units) indicates a sharp upward turn as the calendar moves into mid-August. This aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' and 'Pre-Fall' shopping season, where demand for tailored blazers and workwear typically begins to recover from the summer trough. The average of the last three periods (24-26) is 101 units, but the most recent period (146) shows a +55% jump from the previous week. Given the date (Aug 12), I anticipate a continued upward trajectory as consumers prepare for the autumn season, though I will moderate the forecast to account for typical weekly volatility. I'll project a slight increase over the last observed value to reflect the strengthening seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery for Fall season beginning Period 26: Initial spike of 146 units (+55% vs Period 25) suggests the end of the summer trough and the start of the 'Back-to-Business' demand phase.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for the Mariette Blazer. After a summer trough in July (Periods 21-25) where demand averaged ~105 units, a significant recovery began in August. Period 26 (Aug 5) rose to 146, and Period 27 (Aug 12) spiked to 301 units (+106% week-over-week). This trend aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' retail cycle where demand for tailoring and blazers peaks as consumers prepare for the autumn office season. Since August 19 (Period 28) remains in this peak shopping window, demand is expected to remain very high. However, the jump to 301 likely reflects the initial peak of a fall marketing campaign or collection launch; therefore, I anticipate demand will stabilize near this high level but experience a slight cooling from the absolute peak seen in Period 27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal transition. After a summer trough in July (averaging ~105 units), demand for the Mariette Blazer surged in August. Period 26 (146), Period 27 (301), and Period 28 (251) confirm a 'Back-to-Business' regime shift as consumers prepare for autumn. The current date (August 26) is the peak of this transition. While demand dipped from the Period 27 peak of 301 to 251, the level remains significantly higher than the summer baseline. The average of the last three periods is approximately 233, but the last two periods suggest a new stabilized mean around 250-275. Given the end-of-August timing, demand is expected to remain robust but potentially stabilize slightly before any September shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 27: The 'Back-to-Business' phase has established a new high-demand baseline, with the average jumping from ~105 (P21-P25) to ~233 (P26-P28), a 120% increase.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 26, moving from a summer trough (~105 units) to a high-demand 'Back-to-Business' phase. The demand peaked in Period 27 (301 units) and has since stabilized at a higher baseline. Periods 28 and 29 recorded 251 and 231 units respectively, indicating a slight tapering but maintaining a robust average of approximately 261 units over the last three periods. The current date (Sept 2nd) aligns with the peak of the fall tailoring season as consumers return to office/school environments. Given the slight downward trend from the initial spike but the strong seasonal relevance of a blazer in early September, the forecast anticipates demand to remain near the current established baseline of the last two weeks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major regime shift starting Period 26, transitioning from a summer trough (~105 units) to a 'Back-to-Business' Fall peak. Recent demand (P27-P30) has averaged 285 units, significantly higher than the initial transition estimate of 233. The most recent observation (P30: 357) represents the highest demand recorded for this SKU, coinciding with the start of September, a peak period for womens tailoring. Given the Current Date (2019/09/09) is still in the heart of the Fall retail season, demand is expected to remain elevated. I will forecast a value that respects the recent high-volume trend while slightly moderating the extreme P30 spike.

Carry-over insight: Fall peak intensification confirmed: Average demand for Period 27-30 increased to ~285 units, representing a 22% increase over the initial 'Back-to-Business' transition average of 233 (P26-P28).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a sustained high-demand phase associated with the 'Back-to-Business' Fall season. Analysis of the most recent data shows a significant step up in volume: Period 30 (357) and Period 31 (328) represent the highest demand levels in the dataset. The average of the last five periods (P27-P31) is approximately 294 units, compared to the summer trough (P21-P25) of ~103 units. Given that mid-September is a peak period for professional tailoring as cooler weather arrives and office routines solidify, I expect demand to remain elevated. The forecast weights the recent high-volume trend (avg 342 over last 2 weeks) against the slightly lower month-to-date average to predict a continued strong performance.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently experiencing its peak Fall season ('Back-to-Business'). Demand analysis shows a clear upward shift starting from Period 30. While the average demand for the initial recovery phase (Periods 27-29) was approximately 261 units, the last three weeks (Periods 30-32) have established a significantly higher plateau with an average of 342 units (357, 328, and 341 respectively). This represents a roughly 31% increase over the previous transition phase. Given that late September (Current Date: 2019/09/23) is typically the peak for professional tailoring as seasonal weather shifts, the forecast weights the most recent three-week stability (average 342) heavily. No significant external calendar events suggest a drop, so demand is expected to remain consistent with the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: The 'Fall Peak' has stabilized at a higher baseline, with average demand increasing from ~261 (P27-P29) to ~342 (P30-P32), a 31% increase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing its peak Fall season ('Back-to-Business' phase). Historically, the product saw a regime shift at Period 30, stabilizing at a baseline of approximately 342 units (P30-P32). However, Period 33 (Sept 23) showed a massive surge to 612 units, nearly double the previous baseline. This spike aligns with late September/early October shopping peaks for women's tailoring as autumn weather sets in. Given the current date of September 30, we are at the height of this seasonal demand. While 612 units likely represents a localized peak or promotional impact, demand is expected to remain significantly elevated above the 340 baseline. I forecast a slight normalization from the extreme peak of 612 but sustained high volume, targeting the 450-550 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed at Period 33: Demand spiked to 612 units (+79% vs previous 3-period average of 342), indicating an intensification of the Fall peak season for tailoring.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Fall season ('Back-to-Business'). Historically, demand moved from a summer trough (~105 units) to a high-demand plateau starting in Period 30. While Period 33 saw an exceptional spike to 612 units, Period 34 returned to 313 units, which aligns closely with the established Fall baseline of approximately 342 units (average of P30-P32). Given the date (Oct 7), we are still in the height of blazer season. The forecast assumes demand will remain stable around this high baseline, likely oscillating between 310-350 units now that the P33 outlier has passed.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong 'Back-to-Business' demand phase for the Mariette Blazer starting in late August (Period 26), which transitioned into a 'Fall Peak' baseline of approximately 342 units (Periods 30-32). Period 33 experienced a significant outlier spike to 612 units, likely due to a promotion or specific seasonal event. Following this spike, demand has corrected downwards in Period 34 (313) and Period 35 (283). Current demand is now slightly below the pre-spike average of 342, indicating a cooling-off period as the initial autumn tailoring surge subsides. Given the downward trend over the last two weeks (from 313 to 283), I anticipate a further slight softening for mid-October before demand stabilizes for the remainder of the season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant surge in Period 33 (612 units), followed by a stabilization phase. The demand in the last three periods (P34-P36) has settled into a new, lower baseline compared to the early September peak. Specifically, the average demand for P34-P36 is ~293 units, which is a 14% decrease from the P30-P32 average of ~342 units. The most recent two weeks (283 and 282 units) show high stability, indicating the 'Back-to-Business' peak has cooled as we move deeper into October. For Period 37 (Oct 21), I expect demand to remain consistent with this recent plateau, with a slight conservative adjustment for the continued seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-Fall peak stabilization confirmed starting Period 34. Average demand decreased from ~342 (P30-P32) to ~293 (P34-P36), representing a ~14% reduction as the primary 'Back-to-Business' surge concludes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a strong seasonal pattern, peaking in late September (Period 33) at 612 units during the 'Back-to-Business' phase. Post-peak, the demand has stabilized at a lower but consistent level. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 297.75 units (313, 283, 282, 313), indicating a steady plateau as we move deeper into the Fall season. The current date (Oct 28) marks the end of October, where demand for light tailoring often holds steady before potential holiday-season shifts. Given the high stability and recent uptick to 313, the forecast weights the most recent observation and the 4-period average, anticipating continued demand in the 300 range.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong 'Fall Peak' for the Mariette Blazer, beginning in Period 26. Following a massive outlier in Period 33 (612 units), demand stabilized between 280-315 units (Periods 34-37). However, Period 38 (Oct 28) saw a significant jump to 385 units (+23% over Period 37). This increase aligns with the start of the November retail cycle, where demand for professional/dressed tailoring often rises due to pre-holiday office events and seasonal shopping build-up. Given the upward momentum in the last two periods (313 to 385), I expect demand for Period 39 (Nov 4) to remain elevated or slightly increase as it approaches mid-November shopping events. I will forecast a value reflecting a continuation of this high-demand baseline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its post-Fall peak phase. After a period of stabilization around 293 units (P34-P36), demand showed high volatility with a secondary peak at 385 (P38) followed by a sharp decline to 231 (P39). This 40% drop in P39 suggests the primary 'Back-to-Business' demand has concluded. However, the current date (Nov 11) coincides with Singles' Day and the lead-up to late November promotions. Historically, the demand for tailored blazers tends to stabilize at a lower but steady baseline during mid-November before holiday party demand or Black Friday sales occur. I expect a slight recovery from the P39 trough as demand regresses toward the post-peak mean of ~293, but tempered by the observed downward movement. A forecast of 265 units balances the recent dip with the established seasonal baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows that SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) experienced a major peak in late September (P33: 612) followed by a stabilization phase in October and early November. Recent demand for the last four periods (P37-P40) has averaged approximately 302 units (313, 385, 231, 278). The drop in Period 39 (231) followed by a recovery in Period 40 (278) suggests volatility as the season transitions from 'Back-to-Business' into the late-fall/pre-holiday period. Period 41 (2019/11/18) is the week immediately preceding the Black Friday week. In retail, this often sees a slight uptick in demand as early holiday promotions begin or demand stabilizes before the primary sale spike. Given the recent average and the slight upward momentum from P39 to P40, I forecast demand to remain near the 280-300 range.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that after the 'Fall Peak' in September/October (averaging ~342 units in P30-P32 and ~315 units in P34-P38), demand has entered a cooling phase. The average for the last three periods (P39-P41) has dropped to approximately 251 units, representing a 20% decline from the preceding stabilization phase. However, the current period (P42, starting 2019/11/25) includes Black Friday (Nov 29). In retail, this is a major promotional event that typically generates a significant spike in demand for apparel categories like 'Womens Tailoring'. Comparing the current situation to previous surges (such as the 79% jump in P33), a substantial uplift is expected from the recent 251-unit baseline. A forecast of 385 units reflects a return to the peak levels seen in late October, anticipating the high-volume traffic associated with the Black Friday holiday weekend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Pre-holiday cooling confirmed starting Period 39. Average demand decreased from ~315 (P34-P38) to ~251 (P39-P41), a 20% reduction prior to the late-November holiday shopping season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for the Mariette Blazer shows a pattern of significant spikes followed by sharp corrections. In Period 33, a spike of 612 units was followed by a 49% drop to 313 units in Period 34. Period 42 (Nov 25) shows a massive spike to 733 units, coinciding with the Black Friday promotional week. Period 43 (Dec 2) starts on Cyber Monday; while Cyber Monday is a high-volume day, the overall week following Black Friday typically sees a significant reduction in demand volume compared to the peak surge. Using the previous spike-correction ratio (~50% drop), I expect demand to fall from 733 but remain higher than the pre-holiday cooling average (251) due to early December holiday party dressing trends and Cyber Monday. A forecast around 360-380 units aligns with both the historical correction pattern and the seasonal relevance of tailoring in December.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 shows a 199% increase over the previous 3-period average (245 to 733), marking the peak Black Friday retail event.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant demand regime shift starting in Period 39 (pre-holiday cooling) with an average of ~251 units, followed by a massive Black Friday spike in Period 42 (733 units). Period 43 (Dec 2) showed the expected post-promotional slump with demand dropping to 169 units, a 77% decrease from the peak. Period 44 (Dec 9) represents mid-December retail activity. Typically, demand for 'Womens Tailoring' sees a minor recovery from the immediate post-Cyber Monday hangover as holiday shopping continues, but it usually stabilizes below the primary Fall/Back-to-Business peak (which was ~300+). Given the sharp drop in P43, I expect a moderate regression toward the pre-holiday baseline of 251 units, though slightly tempered by the 'exhaustion' of demand following the major P42 sale.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer exhibits strong seasonal patterns, particularly the 'Back-to-Business' fall peak and a massive holiday spike. Following the Black Friday surge in Period 42 (733 units), demand experienced a sharp correction in Period 43 (169 units) as is typical post-promotion. Period 44 (Dec 9) showed a strong recovery to 304 units, aligning closely with the pre-holiday baseline of ~300 observed in October (Periods 34-37). Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final full shopping week before Christmas. Given the product category (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), demand is expected to remain firm for holiday events but may see a slight tapering as shipping deadlines approach. I forecast a stabilization around the recent high-water mark, slightly moderated from the Period 44 recovery.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear post-Black Friday pattern: a sharp slump (P43: 169) followed by a recovery in early December (P44: 304) and a slight tapering as Christmas approaches (P45: 258). The current period (P46: 2019/12/23) covers the week of Christmas. For tailoring and 'dressed' categories, demand typically softens during this week as consumers shift focus from professional attire to holiday celebrations and leisure, followed by the start of end-of-year clearance sales. Given the recent average of P44-P45 (~281) and the downward movement into the holiday week, I expect demand to continue its moderate decline from P45 levels but remain above the post-holiday slump seen in P43.

568601006: ordered=0, arrived=379 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 3 periods), starting on-hand inventory=379, demand=128, sold=128, ending on-hand inventory=251

Daily Reward (R_t): $261.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant drop in Period 46 (128 units), which aligns with the typical cooling of 'Dressed' tailoring categories during Christmas week. The current period (Period 47, starting 2019/12/30) covers New Year's Eve and the beginning of the January clearance/post-holiday lull. Looking at the trend since the Black Friday spike (733), demand has been volatile: 169 (P43), 304 (P44), 258 (P45), and 128 (P46). The average of the three non-outlier weeks following Black Friday (P44-P46) is approximately 230, but P46 suggests a downward momentum as the festive season concludes. Period 47 is expected to see a slight recovery from the Christmas week low due to New Year sales and early preparation for the January return to work, but it remains below the 'Fall Peak' averages (~280-300). I expect demand to settle near the pre-holiday baseline observed in P39-P41 (avg ~251), adjusted downward for the immediate post-holiday exhaustion.
