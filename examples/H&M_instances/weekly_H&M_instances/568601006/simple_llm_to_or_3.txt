======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, typically associated with professional attire and spring fashion transitions. Historical demand for the five most recent training periods (ending at Period 0) shows a slight upward trend: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186. The average demand across these five periods is 173.4. Given the date (February 11), we are entering the spring retail season where demand for 'Dressed' and 'Tailoring' categories often increases as customers refresh their work wardrobes. The recent sequence shows a shift from the mid-140s to the high-180s/low-190s. I will forecast a value that respects the recent momentum but accounts for the slight dip in the most recent observation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data (ending shortly before Period 1) showed stable demand with an average of 173 units (min 145, max 196). 2. Recent Trend: Period 1 demand came in at 227 units, which is a significant jump (+31% vs training average) and higher than any previous observation. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: February 18th is approaching late winter/early spring. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a tailored 'Dressed' item. This period often sees an increase in demand for office wear and transitional tailoring as customers prepare for the spring season. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the strong jump in Period 1 and the seasonal relevance of blazers in late February, I expect demand to remain elevated relative to the training set. However, since we only have one data point for this new level, I will forecast a slight stabilization at the 220-230 range.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for the 'Mariette Blazer' showed a stable range between 145 and 196 units (average ~173). However, the observed demand in the first two periods of the test phase (Feb 11 and Feb 18) shows a significant and sharp upward shift to 227 and 284 units respectively. This increase coincides with the transition into late February, a key period for women's tailoring as shoppers prepare for spring wardrobes and professional 'back-to-office' transitions after winter. The jump from 227 to 284 indicates a strong upward momentum (+25% week-over-week). For Period 3 (Feb 25), I expect this seasonal trend to continue or stabilize at this higher level, though I will be slightly conservative to account for the rapid pace of the recent increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: Average demand increased from historical ~173 to ~255 (+47%) driven by early spring seasonal interest in women's tailoring.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows a mean of 173 units. Recent periods (1-3) have shown higher levels (227, 284, 198) with an average of 236 units, supporting the previous insight of a demand regime shift due to early spring interest. Period 3 saw a significant drop from Period 2 (284 to 198), signaling a potential stabilization or volatility as we move further into March. Given the date (March 4) is peak season for women's tailoring/workwear (spring collection), demand is expected to remain above the historical average but may fluctuate. I will forecast a slight recovery from the Period 3 dip, aligning with the current regime mean (~230-240) while acknowledging the high variance observed in the last three weeks.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (161-196) and current test data (227-214) show a clear increase in baseline demand compared to early winter. The previous insight suggested a regime shift to ~255 based on early spikes, but the last two periods (198, 214) suggest a more moderate stabilization as we move further into March. The product (Mariette Blazer) is a spring staple. Given the date (March 11), we are entering the peak spring shopping season. Demand has averaged 230 over the last 4 periods. I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase as spring weather stabilizes, likely hovering around the 220-230 range.

Carry-over insight: Refinement of Period 3 insight: Demand has stabilized at a new mean of ~230 (up from training average of ~173) as spring season progresses.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: Training data showed a mean of 173. Test data (Periods 1-5) shows a significant lift, averaging 227.6 units. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The date is March 18, 2019. We are in the core spring season for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' blazers, heading toward late March. 3. Recent Trend: While Periods 1 and 2 were very high (227, 284), the demand has flattened and stabilized over the last three weeks (Period 3: 198, Period 4: 214, Period 5: 215), moving closer to the 'Carry-over Insight' estimate of ~230. 4. Logic: There is high consistency in the last two weeks around 214-215. Given the mid-March timing, no major holiday spike is immediate, suggesting a continuation of this stable spring baseline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -4 to 0) averaged 173 units. Since the start of the test phase (Period 1), the demand for the Mariette Blazer (women's tailored outerwear) shifted significantly upward. Previous carry-over insights identified a regime shift to approximately 230 units. Looking at the most recent three periods (P4, P5, P6), demand has shown remarkable stability, holding at 214, 215, and 215 units respectively. This indicates a very consistent baseline during the mid-March period. As of March 25th (Period 7), we are approaching the peak of the spring retail season for professional clothing/tailoring. Given the extreme stability of the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain nearly constant, potentially seeing a very slight uptick as the season matures, but logic suggests following the current stable mean.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization confirmed: Periods 4-6 show high consistency with a mean of 215 units, indicating the initial spring surge (P1-P2) has leveled off into a steady seasonal plateau.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed an average demand of ~173. During the test phase (Periods 1-7), demand spiked initially (P1-P2) and then stabilized around a mean of 215 (P4-P6). However, Period 7 (March 25th) shows a notable drop to 186 units (-13.5% from the stable plateau). This decline likely signals the beginning of a post-peak spring transition or a cooling of the initial 'Dressed/Tailoring' demand surge as we enter April. Given the consistent 215-unit plateau was broken in P7, I am forecasting a slight further decline or stabilization near this lower level for Period 8 (April 1st), reflecting the shift out of the peak early-spring shopping window.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this women's blazer (training) averaged 173 units. Since entering the test phase (Feb-April), demand shifted to a higher spring regime. While Periods 4-6 stabilized at 215, Period 7 saw a dip (186) followed by a sharp spike in Period 8 (249). The current date is April 8, 2019. In the retail calendar, this period precedes Easter (April 21, 2019), a peak time for 'dressed' categories like blazers as consumers prepare for spring holidays and events. The spike to 249 in Period 8 likely marks the start of this pre-Easter surge. Given the product's category (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), I expect demand to remain elevated near the Period 8 peak or slightly higher as the holiday approaches.

Carry-over insight: Pre-Easter seasonal surge confirmed: Period 8 demand increased to 249 (+16% vs previous stabilization mean of 215), consistent with seasonal demand for 'Dressed' tailoring in April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a baseline of ~173. Recent test data shows a seasonal uplift (spring/Easter tailoring demand). Period 8 saw a peak of 249 (pre-Easter shopping), but Period 9 dropped to 178, likely reflecting the immediate post-holiday lull or the end of the peak Easter buying window. Current date is April 15, 2019 (Monday), the week immediately following Easter Sunday (April 21) or leading into it depending on the region, but usually, demand for 'Dressed' tailoring stabilizes or dips slightly after the main pre-holiday rush. Given the volatile swing between P8 (249) and P9 (178), a reversion toward the established 'seasonal plateau' mean of ~215 observed in Periods 4-6 is expected as the mid-spring season continues.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Avg: 173) was surpassed in early spring (P1-P8 Avg: 221), but a sharp decline has occurred over the last two weeks (P9: 178, P10: 130). Period 10 (April 15) immediately preceded Easter 2019 (April 21). High-demand 'Dressed' categories often peak before the holiday and drop significantly during and immediately after the holiday week as shopping activity for formal attire subsides. Period 11 (April 22) is Easter Monday week; demand is expected to remain low but begin a minor recovery toward the training baseline (173) as the post-holiday slump bottoms out. I am forecasting a slight increase from the P10 low, settling near the training mean.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand correction: The pre-holiday surge (Period 8) was followed by a sharp ~48% decline by Period 10, signaling the end of the peak spring tailoring season.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer (Womens Tailoring) showed a strong spring performance (avg ~215-230) which peaked during the pre-Easter period (Period 8: 249). Since Easter (April 21, 2019), demand has undergone a sharp correction, dropping to 130 and 127 in Periods 10 and 11 respectively. For Period 12 (Apr 29), we are transitioning into late spring/early summer. While the initial spring surge is over, Blazers in 'Dressed' categories typically maintain a baseline demand for workwear and events. The current trend shows stabilization at this lower level (Period 10: 130 vs Period 11: 127). I expect demand to remain relatively flat or slightly recover as it finds its post-holiday baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand regime shift: Demand has established a new lower baseline of ~128 units (down from the spring peak of 215-249), reflecting the typical cooling of tailoring demand following the peak spring holiday season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a training mean of ~173. During the test phase, the item experienced a spring tailoring surge (P1-P8) averaging ~220-250 units, followed by a post-Easter drop in P10-P11 (~128 units). However, Period 12 (Apr 29) shows a significant rebound to 191 units. This rebound likely reflects early May demand drivers such as Mother's Day preparations or late-spring social events (weddings, graduations) where 'Dressed' tailoring is relevant. Given the recent jump from 127 to 191, and the current date of May 6th, demand is expected to remain elevated or slightly soften from the P12 peak but stay above the low P10-P11 baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Dressed' blazer peaked during the early spring/Easter window (P1-P8) and then dropped to a lower baseline around 125-130 units (P10-P11). However, Period 12 and 13 show a rebound (191 and 160 respectively) with an average of 175.5. This likely reflects a secondary seasonal wave associated with May events (weddings, graduations, or late spring social occasions) rather than a return to the lower baseline. Period 13 (160) showed a slight cooling from Period 12 (191), suggesting the peak of this specific secondary wave may have passed. I anticipate demand will continue to moderate back toward the established post-Easter baseline but remain slightly elevated due to the active social calendar in mid-May.

Carry-over insight: Mid-May demand rebound: Periods 12-13 show a secondary peak (avg 175) following the post-Easter trough, suggesting a late-spring 'social event' season demand layer for women's tailoring.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a spring peak followed by a drop and a subsequent mid-May rebound (social event season). Over the last three periods (P12-P14), demand has averaged 182 units (191, 160, 196), confirming the 'secondary peak' identified in the previous carry-over insight. As of May 20th (P15), we are in the heart of the late-spring event season. Recent momentum is positive (196 units), but demand for heavy blazers typically begins to soften as June approaches and weather warms. A slight moderation from the previous week's high is expected, but demand should remain well above the post-Easter floor (128-130).

Carry-over insight: Social event season peak confirmed: Periods 12-14 sustained a higher demand average of ~182 units, a 42% increase from the post-Easter floor (~128).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this women's blazer has shown distinct seasonal phases: an early spring surge (avg ~230), a pre-Easter peak (249), a post-Easter correction (avg ~128), and a recent mid-May 'social event' rebound (avg ~182 during P12-P14). Period 15 showed a significant drop to 143 units (-27% vs P14), suggesting that the social event peak (driven by graduations, weddings, and May holidays) is likely tapering off as June approaches. Historically, training data shows a baseline around 170-180. Given the move into late May (2019/5/27), demand is expected to consolidate between the recent high (196) and the latest dip (143) as the primary spring/early summer peak seasonal interest for formal tailoring begins to normalize.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for the Mariette Blazer has undergone several seasonal shifts: an early spring surge (P1-P2), a stabilized plateau (P3-P7), an Easter spike (P8) followed by a sharp correction (P9-P11), and a secondary 'social event' peak in mid-May (P12-P14, avg 182). Most recently (P15-P16), demand has softened to an average of 155 units. As we enter June, the peak social season for tailoring typically begins to transition into late-summer cooling. The forecast for Period 17 (158 units) anticipates a continuation of this post-peak stabilization, aligning with the average of the most recent two weeks while factoring in the slight upward movement seen between P15 and P16.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal cycle: a spring peak (Feb-March), an Easter surge (early April), and a 'social event' secondary peak (May). As of early June (Current Period 18, 2019/6/10), we are witnessing a transition into the early summer period. Recent demand has trended downward (P15: 143, P16: 168, P17: 118), with the most recent observation of 118 units marking the lowest point since early April. This decline aligns with the conclusion of peak social events (graduations, weddings) that drive blazer sales. Given the 30% drop in Period 17 and the seasonal shift towards warmer weather garments, demand is likely to remain at this lower baseline or decrease slightly further.

Carry-over insight: Post-social season decline: Demand mean has dropped from the May average of ~180 to a June baseline near 120, as peak seasonal interest in woven tailoring fades for the summer.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear transition from a spring peak (averaging ~215-250 units) through a mid-May social event surge (~182 average) into a summer decline phase. Period 18 and 17 recorded 139 and 118 units respectively, aligning with the June baseline of approximately 120-130 units noted in the Carry-Over Insights. As of June 17, we are deep into the summer season where demand for 'Dressed' woven blazers typically softens compared to spring peak occasions. The recent two-period average is 128.5 units. Given that Period 18 saw a slight uptick from Period 17 (118 to 139), I expect demand to remain relatively stable within this new summer baseline, likely oscillating around the 130 mark.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this product (Mariette Blazer). After a strong spring peak (Periods 1-8) and a mid-May social event rebound (Periods 12-16), demand has entered a summer decline phase. Analysis of the last three periods (P17-P19) shows a consistent lower demand regime with values of 118, 139, and 122, resulting in a June average of approximately 126 units. This aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 18 noting a drop to a baseline near 120. As the date is June 24th, we are at the height of summer where demand for 'fitted jackets in woven fabric' typically remains low compared to spring. Based on the recent stability around the 120-130 range and the slight dip in the most recent observation, a forecast slightly below the June average is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: Periods 17-19 have maintained a consistent mean of ~126 units, confirming the transition from the social-event peak to a lower summer floor for woven tailoring.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a clear seasonal lifecycle for the Mariette Blazer. Following a high spring peak (~230 units) and a mid-May social event rebound (~182 units), the product entered a summer cooling phase in June with an established baseline of ~126 units (Periods 17-19). Period 20 shows a sharp, significant drop to 73 units (a ~42% decline from the June average). Given the date (July 1st), this likely represents the transition into the mid-summer clearance or off-season trough for 'Dressed' woven tailoring as consumer focus shifts toward lighter summer apparel. The forecast accounts for this regime shift toward a lower summer floor while allowing for minor stabilization after the initial sharp drop.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift: Period 20 marks a sharp departure from the June baseline, with demand falling from ~126 to 73 units (-42%), signaling the start of the mid-summer low season for the blazer category.

Historical analysis shows a sequence of seasonal regime shifts: a spring peak (P1-P8, avg ~220), a post-Easter correction (P9-P11, avg ~145), a social-event rebound in May (P12-P16, avg ~170), and a June summer baseline (P17-P19, avg ~126). Period 20 showed a sharp mid-summer decline to 73 units, followed by a partial recovery in Period 21 to 116 units. For Period 22 (July 8th), demand for heavy woven tailoring like a fitted blazer is typically at its seasonal low due to heat and vacation cycles, though often mitigated by summer sales. Given the recent average of 95 units across the last two periods (73 and 116), I expect demand to stabilize around the 110-unit mark, remaining significantly below the June baseline of 126.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonality for the 'Mariette Blazer', which peaked in early spring (P1-P8 avg: ~215-255) and social event season (P12-P16 avg: ~170-180). We are currently in mid-July (current date 2019/7/15). The 'Carry-over Insights' noted a sharp drop in Period 20 (73 units) initially identified as a mid-summer low season shift. However, Periods 21 and 22 have rebounded to 116 and 120 units respectively. This suggests Period 20 was a temporary outlier rather than a sustained 42% regime shift. The current demand level (avg of last two periods: 118) is very close to the June baseline of ~126 units identified in Period 20's carry-over. July typically represents a low-interest period for heavy woven tailoring before the late-summer 'back-to-office' or autumn transition begins. I expect demand to remain stable near this summer floor.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a series of seasonal shifts: a spring peak (~215-249), a May social-event rebound (~182), and a decline into a summer baseline (~126). Period 20 (June 24) showed a significant dip to 73, initially suggesting a mid-summer low, but subsequent periods 21-23 have consistently rebounded and stabilized. The average for the last three periods (21, 22, 23) is 118.7 units (116, 120, 120), showing high stability. As the current date is July 22, we are in the peak of summer where 'Womens Tailoring' typically maintains a lower but steady baseline before any autumn/back-to-office interest begins. Given the perfect stability of 120 units over the last two weeks, the forecast remains matched to this current baseline.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed: Following the Period 20 dip (73 units), demand has returned to and stabilized at a consistent baseline of ~119 units (Periods 21-23), indicating the mid-summer floor for this category.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows distinct seasonal phases: spring peak (P1-P8, ~220 units), secondary social-event peaks (P12-P14, ~180 units), and a summer baseline (P17-P19, ~126 units). Recent data (P20-P24) displays significant volatility. Period 20 dropped to 73, followed by a stabilization at ~119 for three weeks (P21-P23). Period 24 shows another sharp drop to 63 units. Comparing P24 to P20 (which both occurred roughly 4 weeks apart following periods of stability around 120), it appears we are in a late-July/early-August trough period, likely driven by end-of-season clearance transitions or peak summer holiday weeks where interest in woven blazers reach an annual low. Period 20 was 73 and Period 24 is 63; the forecast will align with this lower bound given the end-of-July timing.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' (a dressed tailoring item) has moved through a spring peak (mean ~215-249), a May social-event rebound (~182), and a summer baseline (~119-126). Recent data shows a significant downward shift starting in late July. Following Period 23 (120 units), demand dropped to 63 (P24) and recovered slightly to 94 (P25). Given the current date is August 5th, we are in the mid-to-late summer trough. The average of the last two periods is 78.5 units. Historically, late summer is a transition period before the 'Back to Office' or fall tailoring season begins in mid-to-late August. For Period 26, demand is expected to remain in this lower transitional regime before true fall interest resumes. I will forecast a slight increase from P25 as the market very slowly moves toward the autumn refresh, but remain well below the summer baseline.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime shift: Mid-July through early August (Periods 24-25) shows a significant drop-off to an average of ~79 units, down ~34% from the previous summer baseline of ~119 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that this product (Mariette Blazer) has moved through several seasonal phases: a strong spring peak (200+), a mid-May social season peak (~180), and a gradual summer decline. Recent data shows a notable late-summer trough in Periods 24-25 (avg 78.5). However, Period 26 (August 5) shows a significant jump to 146 units. This aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' or 'Back-to-School' transition common in mid-August for women's tailoring (blazers), as consumers prepare for autumn work wardrobes. Given that the date is August 12, we are entering the heart of the late-summer recovery. The jump from 94 to 146 represents a 55% week-over-week increase. I expect this upward momentum to continue toward the previous stable baselines as the brand moves out of the summer clearance/low-interest phase and into the pre-autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-business recovery: Period 26 marks a reversal of the late-summer decline, with demand increasing from 94 to 146 (+55%), signals the end of the mid-summer low season for blazers.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU ('Mariette Blazer') follows clear seasonal patterns related to women's tailoring: a spring surge, a spring social event peak, a mid-summer trough, and a late-August 'back-to-business' recovery. Recent data shows a dramatic shift: Period 26 (146 units) signalled the end of the summer low, and Period 27 (301 units) confirms a massive surge (+106% WoW). This aligns with peak late-August 'Back-to-Office' demand for formal tailored pieces. Last week's 301 is significantly above any previous peak (the previous high was 284 in Period 2), suggesting a very strong seasonal momentum. I expect demand to remain highly elevated as the late-August shopping peak continues, likely plateauing or slightly increasing as full fall assortments are shopped.

Carry-over insight: Significant 'Back-to-Business' surge confirmed: Demand increased from a late-summer average of ~79 to 301 units (+280%) between Periods 25 and 27, establishing a strong late-August seasonal peak for tailoring.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand shows a significant seasonal 'Back-to-Business' surge for this blazer SKU. Demand rose from a late-summer average of ~79 units to a peak of 301 units in Period 27 (mid-August) and slightly moderated to 251 units in Period 28 (August 19). For Period 29 (August 26), we are at the intersection of late-summer workwear shopping and the start of the autumn retail season. While Period 28 showed a slight deceleration from the peak in Period 27, demand remains extremely high compared to summer levels. Historically, this type of seasonal surge (similar to the spring peak) levels off over several periods rather than dropping immediately. Given the high consistency of the current surge and the proximity to active shopping for professional attire, I expect demand to stay elevated but continue a slight downward trend from the initial peak as the primary surge stabilizes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' shows a distinct seasonal pattern. We are currently in the early September 'Back-to-Business' window. Demand saw a massive surge starting Period 26 (146 units), peaking in Period 27 (301 units), and has since begun a gradual deceleration (251 in Period 28, 231 in Period 29). This follows the classic retail pattern where the initial inventory launch for the new season triggers a high initial spike followed by a stabilization at a higher-than-summer level. Given the 8% decline between P28 and P29, I expect a continued but slowing downward trend as the peak 'Back-to-Business' shopping concludes and demand settles into an autumn baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-'Back-to-Business' stabilization: Following the late-August peak of 301 units, demand is trending towards a new autumn plateau, currently averaging ~241 units over the last two periods (P28-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Dressed' blazer shows a significant 'Back-to-Business' autumn recovery beginning in mid-August (P27). Recent performance shows a surge from a baseline of ~241 units (P28-P29) to 357 units in P30 (September 2nd), representing a 50% week-over-week increase. This surge aligns with peak professional/seasonal transitions in early September. While P30 shows a sharp peak, history suggests high-demand periods for this item often sustain for 2-3 weeks before cooling (as seen in the Spring and late-August cycles), or slightly oscillate. I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly retract from the exceptional P30 peak as the initial September rush settles.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal peak confirmed: Period 30 demand (357 units) represents a ~50% increase over the late-August plateau (~241 units), marking the primary autumn peak for blazers.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a strong seasonal pattern for the 'Mariette Blazer', with a primary autumn 'Back-to-Business' peak occurring in late August and early September. Period 30 (Date: 9/2) recorded an absolute peak of 357 units, followed by a slight cooling to 328 units in Period 31 (Date: 9/9). This 8% decrease suggests the initial surge has passed its crest. Current date 9/16 (Period 32) typically sees sustained autumn demand but at a gradually decelerating rate as the immediate seasonal wardrobe update window closes. I expect demand to remain robust and well above the preceding August plateau (~241) but follow the downward trajectory from the Sept 2nd peak. Predicted demand is set slightly below Period 31 to reflect this cooling trend while maintaining the elevated autumn baseline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant demand surge starting in late August (Period 27: 301 units) corresponding to 'Back-to-Business' shopping. Following a brief stabilization in late August (Avg ~241), demand entered a secondary, higher peak in September. Specifically, the last three periods (P30-P32) have established a high plateau with demands of 357, 328, and 341 respectively, resulting in a three-week average of ~342 units. Given the date (Sept 23) is still within the primary autumn tailoring season and demand has remained highly consistent above 320 units for three consecutive weeks, the forecast anticipates a continuation of this autumn peak performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn plateau confirmed: Periods 30-32 have stabilized at a high-demand baseline of ~342 units, representing a 42% increase over the late-August 'Back-to-Business' stabilization level.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand established a consistent autumn plateau of ~342 units during Periods 30-32. Period 33 showed a massive surge to 612 units, which is an 80% increase over the plateau, likely driven by late-September paydays or specific seasonal promotions for tailoring. For Period 34 (Sept 30), I anticipate demand will remain significantly higher than the previous 340-unit baseline due to autumn momentum, but will experience a correction from the extreme peak of Period 33 as the initial surge effect tapers off.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data indicates a sustained autumn plateau began in Period 30 (averaging ~342 units). While Period 33 experienced a sharp anomalous spike to 612 units, Period 34 demand (313 units) suggests a return to the established seasonal baseline rather than a new upward regime. As of early October, demand for woven tailoring remains seasonally strong but typically stabilizes or slightly softens following the primary September transition. The forecast anticipates demand will remain consistent with the pre-spike plateau levels, slightly adjusted for the minor downward movement seen in P34.

Carry-over insight: Transient demand spike in Period 33: The jump to 612 units was temporary, with Period 34 (313 units) confirming a return to the established autumn plateau baseline of ~335 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong 'Autumn plateau' established in September (Periods 30-32) averaging ~342 units. After a transient spike in Period 33 (612 units), demand has returned to and started to decline from that plateau: Period 34 was 313 units and Period 35 was 283 units. This downward trajectory (a ~10% week-over-week decrease) suggests the primary 'Back-to-Business' and early autumn seasonal peak is tapering off as we move into mid-October. Given the current date (October 14th) and the recent cooling trend, I expect demand to continue its gradual descent toward a late-autumn baseline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a transition from an autumn peak (Periods 30-32, avg ~342) to a slightly lower plateau in October. Period 33 was a temporary spike (612), but Periods 34-36 have since stabilized at a mean of ~293 units (313, 283, 282), indicating the initial 'Back-to-Business' urgency has finished, settling into a steady late-autumn baseline for the 'Womens Tailoring' category. Given the stability over the last two weeks at 283 and 282 units, and the lack of major upcoming promotional events in the immediate next week for tailored blazers, the forecast expects the current stability to continue.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stabilization confirmed: Following the September peak, demand has settled into a consistent October baseline of ~293 units (Periods 34-36), a ~14% decline from the September plateau (~342).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has shown distinct seasonal behavior throughout the year. Following a significant autumn peak in September (averaging ~342), demand transitioned into an October stabilization phase with a mean of 293 units (Periods 34-36). The most recent observation (Period 37: 313 units) shows a slight uptick from that baseline but remains within a consistent range for late October. Historically, tailoring demand for professional and 'dressed' items remains relatively stable through late autumn before winter transitions. Given the current date of October 28th and the consistency of the last four weeks (range 282-313), I expect demand to hover around the 300-unit mark for Period 38.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data showed an October stabilization plateau around 293 units (Periods 34-36). However, recent demand in Period 37 (313) and Period 38 (385) indicates a significant upward break from that plateau. As we move into early November (Period 39), demand for women's tailoring typically strengthens due to the 'Singles' Day' lead-up and general late-autumn office/event wear needs. The jump from 313 to 385 (+23%) suggests strong momentum. I forecast a continued increase or high-level stabilization for Period 39 as consumers prepare for mid-November retail events.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) shows a shift from the October autumn stabilization baseline of ~293 units (Periods 34-36) into a more volatile November phase. Period 38 saw a significant spike to 385 units (likely driven by early Singles' Day or mid-season promotional activity), followed by a sharp normalization in Period 39 to 231 units (a ~40% drop from the spike). Looking at the calendar, Period 40 (2019/11/11) is the week of Singles' Day (11/11), which is a major global retail event particularly strong for 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' categories. Historical behavior for this SKU suggests that spikes (e.g., P33, P38) are typically preceded or followed by a return to recent baselines. However, given the specific date of 11/11 falling within this period, I anticipate a significant rebound from the Period 39 low. I expect demand to exceed the October baseline (~293) due to event-driven traffic, while moderating from the extremity of Period 38's spike.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November volatility: The October baseline of ~293 units has been disrupted by a pre-Singles' Day spike (P38: 385) and a subsequent sharp correction (P39: 231), indicating increased sensitivity to holiday calendar events.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently influenced by late autumn seasonality and major retail calendar events. Historically, the October baseline was established at ~293 units. Period 38 saw a spike (385) likely related to pre-Singles' Day (Nov 11) promotions, followed by a sharp drop in Period 39 (231) as demand was pulled forward. Period 40 (278 units) shows a recovery toward the established autumn baseline but remains slightly below the October average. The current date (2019/11/18) is the week following Singles' Day and precedes the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak (Nov 29). Without a major holiday in the immediate target week, demand is expected to remain near the established baseline of ~280-290 units, though likely showing a slight upward lean as shoppers begin early holiday season browsing. Forecast is set at 285 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' is highly responsive to retail calendar events, with significant peaks during the late-August 'Back-to-Business' window (301 units) and the September seasonal launch (612 units). More recently, the demand established an October plateau of ~293 units before entering a volatile November. Period 40 (Nov 11 - Singles' Day) saw demand at 278 units, followed by a slight dip to 245 units in Period 41. Period 42 (Nov 25 - Dec 1) encompasses Black Friday (Nov 29). Given the item's category ('Dressed' tailoring) and proven sensitivity to sales events (such as the 385 units seen in Period 38), a significant spike is anticipated for the Black Friday week. I expect demand to exceed the October baseline and the Singles' Day volume, returning toward the levels seen during previous major retail surges.

The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has shown high sensitivity to promotional and holiday calendar events. Period 42 (Nov 25) saw a massive spike to 733 units (+200% over the previous period), which corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. Historically, such spikes (e.g., Period 33, Period 38) are transient and followed by sharp corrections. While the autumn baseline was approximately 293 units (P34-P36), the recent pre-Black Friday demand (P39-P41) averaged 251 units, suggesting a cooling of regular organic interest as winter approaches. Period 43 (Dec 2) follows the major promotional event; therefore, demand is expected to drop significantly from the hyper-peak. However, early December typically maintains a 'holiday party' readiness baseline above the mid-summer lows but below the peak autumn 'back-to-business' levels. I forecast a return toward the mid-November average of ~250 units, adjusted slightly for the post-promotion exhaustion effect.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge confirmed: Period 42 saw a 200% increase (733 units) compared to the November average (~250), confirming the category's high responsiveness to major year-end retail events.

Predicted demand: 240 units

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a massive surge in Period 42 (733 units) for Black Friday, followed by a sharp 'post-sale crash' in Period 43 (169 units), which fell well below the previous November baseline of ~250 units. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand for the 'Dressed' blazer category typically sees a modest lift from holiday event shopping before the end-of-year peak. However, given the depth of the post-Black Friday exhaustion (169 units), the recovery is expected to be gradual. I forecast a slight uptick as demand reverts toward a stabilized mid-December level, though it will likely remain below the autumn average of ~290 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows the 'Mariette Blazer' is highly responsive to 'Dressed' seasonal events and retail holidays. Following the Black Friday surge (P42: 733) and the expected post-event trough (P43: 169), Period 44 (Dec 9) saw a strong rebound to 304 units (+80% WoW). Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final peak shopping week for the Christmas and New Year's Eve holiday period. Given the product's category as 'Womens Tailoring | Dressed', demand typically remains elevated in mid-December for holiday social events. The forecast anticipates demand will stay within the 300-330 range, consistent with the Autumn plateau and the rebound observed in P44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the Black Friday peak (P42) and subsequent correction (P43), demand for the Mariette Blazer stabilized in mid-December with an average of approximately 281 units (P44-P45). The current period (P46) covers the week starting December 23rd, which includes the immediate lead-up to Christmas and the commencement of significant post-Christmas/Boxing Day sales. Historically, blazers in the 'Dressed' category see sustained interest for New Year's Eve events and promotional clearance. While the drop from 304 to 258 units in the previous week suggests a slight cooling of full-price holiday shopping, the start of end-of-season sales typically provides a moderate boost to volume. Therefore, I forecast demand to remain relatively steady with a slight upward adjustment for sales activity, centering around the recent two-week mean.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals that the 'Mariette Blazer' is highly sensitive to seasonal and calendar events. Following the mid-December peak (P44-P45: avg ~281), Period 46 (Christmas week) saw a sharp 50% decline to 128 units. This mirrors previous post-peak corrections observed after Easter (P10-11: ~128 units) and the post-social season decline in June (P17-19: ~126 units). Period 47 (Dec 30) falls during the New Year transition week, a period typically characterized by the continuation of the post-Christmas retail slump for 'Dressed' categories as consumer focus shifts away from formal tailoring until the 'Back-to-Business' cycle resumes in late January. Therefore, demand is expected to remain at or slightly below the current seasonal floor of ~128 units.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday seasonal floor: Demand for the woven blazer category has returned to a baseline of approximately 125-130 units following the December holiday peak, consistent with the post-Easter and post-social season floors observed earlier in the year.
