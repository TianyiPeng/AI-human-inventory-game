Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is a 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' item. This is traditionally a core item for office wear and transitional spring fashion. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (which likely correspond to the preceding weeks) shows a steady upward trend: [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging 173.4 units per period. Since promised lead time is 0, orders placed now arrive in the same period. I will use the mean of the available history (N=5) to set mu_hat. Given the upward trend and the 'Dressed' category's stability, recent_N capturing the full history is appropriate to balance service level and holding cost ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost). L is set to default (0).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is office/dressed wear. In Period 1, we ordered 191 units, and they arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), but demand was 227, resulting in a stockout (sold 191, ending inventory 0). The historical demand [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] plus the recent Period 1 demand (227) shows a clear upward trend. The mean of the 5 historical samples is ~173.4. Comparing the last 3 samples (179, 196, 186; mean ~187) to Period 1 (227), there is a significant shift (+21% over the previous mean). Given it is mid-February, we are likely seeing early Spring/office-wear seasonality. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent acceleration while smoothing the single outlier of 227. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for increased volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring piece. Current date is late February, which aligns with the transition into Spring workwear/events. Demand history shows a significant upward trend (161, 145, 179, 196, 186 prior to start, followed by 227 and 284 in the game periods). In both Period 1 and Period 2, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), indicating that actual demand is likely higher than what we sold. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms orders arrive within the same period (L=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent growth trend and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for higher volatility given the stockout-constrained demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurring in late February/early March due to Spring seasonality; observed demand (227, 284) exceeds the pre-game average (~173).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in early March, a season typically associated with increased demand for professional women's apparel like blazers. Historical pre-game demand was ~173, but recent periods (P1: 227, P2: 284, P3: 198) show a shift toward higher volume. While P3 (198) was lower than P2, the overall average of the last 3 periods is ~236, which is significantly higher (+36%) than the pre-game data. Since the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival), we must ensure on-hand inventory mirrors the current upward trend to capture sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh these higher recent observations more heavily than the older pre-game samples, adapting to the Spring fashion regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees increased demand during the spring transition (late February and March). Historical data shows a clear upward shift in demand coinciding with this seasonal window: the five pre-game samples averaged 173.4, while the four periods in-game (Feb 11 - Mar 4) have averaged 230.75 (227, 284, 198, 214). Although period 3 and 4 were slightly lower than period 2, they remain significantly above the pre-game baseline. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived within the same period). Given the seasonal window (early March), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this elevated spring demand regime for both Mean (mu_hat) and Volatility (sigma_hat) calculation, effectively ignoring the lower pre-game values which are less relevant to the current spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1 (mid-February): current spring average (231) is ~33% higher than pre-game baseline (173).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a spring/summer tailored garment. The date is March 18th (Period 6). Historically, the pre-game baseline demand was ~173. Since Period 1 (mid-February), demand has shifted to a higher spring regime, averaging 227.6 units over the last 5 periods ([227, 284, 198, 214, 215]). The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have successfully arrived with an actual lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by periods 1 through 5 results. Currently, we have 48 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Since we are in the peak of spring demand for womens tailoring, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the sustained shift from the baseline. L is set to default (0). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility observed in this regime (standard deviation ~32.7) compared to the long-term stable baseline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a steady spring demand regime. Since Period 1, observed demand has consistent values of 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, and 215. The mean demand over these last 6 periods is approximately 225.5, which is significantly higher than the pre-game average of 173.3. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded observations. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it aligns with the spring seasonality identified in previous periods. Setting L to the promised lead time of 0 is justified by the perfect historical arrival record.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered a stable demand regime following a seasonal shift in mid-February. The demand over the last 5 periods (Period 3 to 7) has been [198, 214, 215, 215, 186], yielding a mean of 205.6 and a standard deviation of 12.8. This is significantly higher than the pre-game average (~173) but stable compared to the early spring highs (227, 284). The observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To maintain a high service level for this 'Dressed/Womens Tailoring' item during the spring season while managing inventory, I will set L to the promised 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this stabilized spring demand regime (Period 3-7) and ignore the initial volatile spikes. This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for current traffic without overreacting to the February outliers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized starting Period 3 (Late Feb): Mean demand is ~206 (\u03c3 \u2248 13) following initial spring rollout volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak Spring season. In Period 8 (April 1), we observed a demand spike of 249 units, which exhausted our inventory and resulted in lost sales. The current mean demand since Period 3 (approx. 6 samples) is 212.8, while the standard deviation is approximately 21.6. Given the April 8th date, demand is likely to remain elevated or increase slightly as spring shopping continues. Because lead time is consistently 0, we need to ensure the base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is high enough to satisfy this period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable spring regime while acknowledging the recent spike, and 'recent_N' for sigma to account for the increased variability (\u03c3\u224821 vs historical ~15).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in early April (Period 8: 249 units), leading to stockout. Spring demand regime (P3-P8) average is 212.8 with higher volatility (\u03c3\u224821).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'), currently in its spring season. Period 10 corresponds to mid-April. Looking at the demand history, we saw a significant peak in Period 8 (249 units, early April), followed by a lower demand of 178 in Period 9 (mid-April). The 'Spring regime' (Periods 3-9) has an average demand of 207.8. Given the product's likely relevance for spring events and the transition into mid-to-late April, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the seasonal average while accounting for the recent high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (the full spring regime from Period 3 onwards) to smooth out the noise from the stockout period while maintaining a high enough service level to capture potential spring spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer), which typically sees higher demand in early spring (Feb-Apr) as a transitional garment. Current date is April 22nd. Demand has significantly cooled in the last two periods (P9: 178, P10: 130) compared to the March/Early April peak (avg ~213). This suggests the spring peak has passed and we are entering a lower demand regime or potentially a post-Easter lull. Comparing recent samples, the last 3 periods (P8-P10) average 185.7 units, but the very recent drop to 130 suggests high volatility or a downshift. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend and increased volatility (\u03c3\u224860 in the last 3 periods), ensuring we don't overstock as the season winds down while maintaining enough buffer for the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift detected starting mid-April (Period 10): Demand dropped to 130 from a Mar/Early-Apr average of ~213, indicating the end of the spring peak for this tailoring SKU.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, entering May. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime change. Periods 3-9 (late Feb to early April) averaged ~208 units, but the last two periods (Period 10: 130, Period 11: 127) confirm a sustained downshift as the primary spring tailoring peak subsides. The 'Mariette Blazer' is likely entering a post-peak stability phase before the next seasonal shift. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the stability of the last two demand points, I will use recent_N with N=3 (capturing the shift from P9's 178 to the current ~130 level) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach allows the OR backend to quickly align the base stock with the lower demand level, reducing the risk of excess inventory and holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding Cost $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Mid-April (Period 10) to late April (Period 11) indicates a new average of ~130 units, down from the Spring peak average of ~208 (-37.5%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are observing high volatility in the demand for the Mariette Blazer. After a confirmed downshift in mid-April (Periods 10-11: ~128.5 avg), Period 12 saw a sudden spike back to 191 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests that while the pure 'Spring peak' may have subsided, May is bringing renewed interest or promotional activity. Given the stockout in Period 12 and the inventory being at 0, we must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to regain service levels. I will use the last 3 periods (P10-P12) to calculate parameters, as this captures the current post-peak instability best (N=3). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early May (Period 12): after a two-week low (~128), demand spiked to 191, indicating an unstable post-peak regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) has entered a post-peak spring phase with high volatility. After a significant demand drop in mid-April (Periods 10-11: avg ~128), we saw a spike to 191 in Period 12 followed by 160 in Period 13. The current date is May 13th. The high demand in Period 12 likely resulted in a stockout (sold 170 units, but demand was 191), while Period 13 demand (160) suggests we are settling into a secondary late-spring/early-summer plateau higher than the mid-April trough. I am choosing N=4 (Periods 10-13) for mu_hat to capture this transition, resulting in a mean of 152. For sigma_hat, I am using N=5 (Periods 9-13) to better capture the recent volatility (stdev approx 28), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this unstable phase. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilized at a higher-than-expected level in May (P12-P13 avg: 175) compared to the mid-April trough (P10-P11 avg: 128), suggesting a secondary plateau for late spring.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) has entered a more volatile late-spring demand regime. After a dip in mid-April (P10-P11 avg: 128.5), demand has surged again in May (P12-P14: 191, 160, 196), with the most recent demand (196) causing a stockout. This indicates the 'secondary plateau' identified in Period 14 is stronger than initially estimated. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P12-P14) is 182.3. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory 0 in 3 of the last 7 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 samples to capture this recent May resurgence and use a matching recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains safety stock for this secondary peak.

Carry-over insight: Secondary late-spring peak confirmed: May demand (P12-P14 avg: 182.3) has rebounded significantly from the mid-April trough (P10-P11 avg: 128.5), showing sustained strength despite being past the primary spring peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Mariette Blazer) is in a secondary late-spring demand plateau. Performance over the last four periods (P12-P15) shows demand figures of 191, 160, 196, and 143. This averages to approximately 172.5 units per period. While the most recent period saw a drop to 143, the overall May trend is significantly higher than the mid-April trough (~128). Given the date (May 27) and the 'Womens Tailoring' category, demand is likely to remain around this secondary plateau level before a potential summer seasonal shift. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current late-spring regime (approx. 173 mean) while smoothing out the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the Mariette Blazer has moved past its primary spring peak and a secondary May plateau. Observed demand for Period 16 was 168, and the average for the most recent 4 periods (P13-P16) is 166.75 (values: 160, 196, 143, 168). This indicates a stabilization around the mid-160s, which is lower than the March/April peak (~210) but significantly higher than the mid-April trough (~130). Given the June date, we expect a gradual tapering of demand for tailoring. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stabilized 'late spring/early summer' average. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit/Holding cost ratio justifies a service level of 0.80, which the OR backend will approximate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-peak demand regime (P13-P16) averages ~167 units, reflecting a gradual decline from primary spring levels but maintaining a consistent baseline through early June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is entering mid-June (Period 18). Historical demand shows a significant drop in the most recent period (P17: 118 units), following a moderate late-spring plateau (P13-P16 average ~167). This decline suggests the secondary spring demand peak is fading as we move into summer. The product is a fitted jacket, which typically sees lower demand in warmer months. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (current on-hand is 68 units), I am focusing on the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture the current downward trend. This period's mu_hat calculation using recent_N=5 (average ~157) helps bridge the gap between the May strength and the June cooling. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift detected in early June (Period 17): Demand dropped to 118 from the P13-P16 'secondary peak' average of 167 (-29%), likely reflecting a seasonal transition into summer for this tailoring SKU.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), managing the Mariette Blazer. Historically, this SKU saw a spring peak (late Feb to early April) and a secondary late-spring plateau (May). Recent demand confirms a summer downshift: Period 17 (118) and Period 18 (139) show a significant drop from the May average of ~167. Looking at the last two periods (P17-P18), the mean is 128.5. Given the product is a 'fitted jacket in woven fabric,' it is highly seasonal and demand typically wanes during hotter summer months (June/July). I will shift the demand forecasting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 16, 17, and 18: 168, 118, 139) while remaining responsive to further declines. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. On-hand is 43, which is low, but the OR engine's capped policy will adjust the order based on the new, lower mean.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand downshift confirmed in mid-June: Period 17-18 average (~129) is significantly lower than the May secondary plateau (~167), reflecting seasonal decline for outerwear.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a summer demand regime. Historical demand for the most recent period (P19) was 122 units, and the average for the period since the summer downshift (P17-P19) is 126.3 units. This confirms the previously identified downshift from the May average (~167). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this lower, more stable summer demand while remaining responsive to slight week-to-week variations, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3. This focuses specifically on the current summer regime starting with the Period 17 drop, ensuring we don't over-order based on previous spring peaks while maintaining enough stock for a 1-period lookahead (1+L where L=0).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into July (Summer). Demand in Period 20 dropped significantly to 73 units, the lowest recorded. The previous four periods (P17-P20) show a downward trend (118, 139, 122, 73). A new demand regime for the summer season is confirmed starting Period 17. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods captures this downshift, though it may still be slightly high if the decline continues. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high units_sold to profit ratio (4:1) versus holding cost (1:1), the OR backend will still maintain a safety buffer, but reducing the mean is critical to avoid excessive holding costs as demand for outerwear fades during July.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed: July entry (Period 20) shows a significant drop to 73 units, extending the downward trend started in Period 17. Summer regime (P17-P20) average is ~113 units, down ~32% from the June secondary peak (~167).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Blazer) is in a clear summer demand trough. Demand in Period 21 was 116, which is higher than Period 20 (73) but follows a generally declining trend from the spring/early summer peaks. The current 'summer regime' (since Period 17) has an average demand of approximately 107.6 units (118, 139, 122, 73, 116). Although Period 21 showed a slight recovery, the overall July context suggests maintaining a conservative inventory level to avoid high holding costs ($1.0/unit), especially with a high profit margin ($4.0/unit) supporting a 0.8 service level. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use the last 5 periods (P17-P21) to capture the current summer demand levels for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand trough for the Mariette Blazer (Women's Tailoring). After bottoming out at 73 units in Period 20, demand for the last two periods has stabilized at a slightly higher level (116 and 120 units). The current date is July 15th, which is deep in the summer season where blazer demand is typically lower than in spring. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the summer regime that started around Period 17 (demands: 118, 139, 122, 73, 116, 120). This provides an average demand (mu_hat) of approximately 115 units per period. The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. These parameters will adjust the base stock to match current summer demand levels, preventing overstocking and excessive holding costs while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the recent uptick towards 120 units.

Carry-over insight: Summer stabilization confirmed mid-July (P21-P22): Demand has recovered from the July 1st trough (73) to a stable range of 115-120 units, establishing the mid-summer baseline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized after the early July trough. Periods 21, 22, and 23 show demand values of 116, 120, and 120 respectively, indicating a very stable mid-summer baseline. The average demand for this three-period regime is approximately 118.7 units with minimal variance. Based on the Carry-over Insight from Period 23, I am using a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture this specific post-trough stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for this stable demand while keeping holding costs in check, given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a summer demand regime for this blazer SKU. While periods 21-23 showed stabilization between 116-120 units, Period 24 saw a sharp drop to 63 units, similar to the trough seen in Period 20 (73 units). This suggests that the summer baseline is more volatile than previously thought or is entering a new late-summer decline towards August. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this recent increase in volatility and lower demand volume while maintaining responsiveness, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=4 (Periods 21-24) captures the recent stabilization and the subsequent drop, yielding a mean of ~105, which balances the 120-unit level with the 63-unit drop, providing a safe but not excessive inventory target for late July.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility confirmed: Following a brief stabilization at ~120 units (P21-P23), Period 24 demand dropped to 63, indicating a non-linear decline or high variance in the mid-to-late summer regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Women's Blazer) is currently in a late-summer demand phase (early August). Historically, this period shows increased volatility as summer transitions toward the fall pre-collection. Recent demand (P24: 63, P25: 94) reflects this irregularity compared to the mid-July stabilization (~120). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 83 units. Given the transition into August, demand is expected to remain in this lower, volatile range before the fall refresh. I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods to capture this most recent late-summer regime (P21-P25). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all concluded orders.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P25) shows lower mean (~83) and higher relative volatility compared to the mid-July baseline, reflecting seasonal transition away from high-summer products.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is entering mid-August (Period 27). Historically, demand for tailoring/blazers is seasonally low in mid-summer (July average ~95) but begins to recover as the 'Back to Work' or 'Late Summer/Pre-Fall' season approaches. Period 26 showed a significant demand spike to 146 units, resulting in a stockout. This spike follows a period of higher volatility (P24: 63, P25: 94). Given the date (Aug 12), this suggests the start of a seasonal recovery regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the transition from the summer trough (starting P21) while reacting to the recent upward trend. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to account for the increased volatility observed in late July/early August. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand recovery detected starting Period 26 (Aug 5): Demand jumped to 146 from a July average of ~95, signaling the start of the pre-fall/back-to-work seasonal transition for tailoring SKUs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late-August/early-September 'back-to-work' seasonal peak for tailoring. Period 27 demand reached 301 units, a massive spike following Period 26's 146 units, confirming the start of this fall transition. Current pre-game and spring data are less relevant than this immediate upward trajectory. To avoid the stockouts experienced in P26 and P27, I am using an explicit forecast. mu_hat is set to 310 to cover the current high-demand momentum (observed 301 units), and sigma_hat is set to 45 to account for the increased volatility seen during seasonal transitions. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-work/Pre-fall seasonal peak confirmed starting August (P26-P27): Demand escalated from a July average of ~95 to 146 (P26) and 301 (P27), signaling a high-demand regime for tailoring SKUs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Mariette Blazer' is currently in a high-demand August 'Back-to-Work' regime. Demand jumped from a July average of ~95 to 146 in P26, peaked at 301 in P27, and remains strong at 251 in P28. This aligns with the seasonal transition where consumers refresh tailoring wardrobes for the return to professional environments. The mean demand for this recent 3-period peak (P26-P28) is ~233 units. While P27 was an outlier (301), the most recent demand (251) suggests the volume is sustaining well above previous summer levels. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to capture this new high-demand plateau while accounting for the recent variance via the sigma_hat parameter. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated sales expectations while mitigating stockout risk during this critical seasonal window.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September marks a primary season for 'Womens Tailoring' as customers return to professional routines. We've observed a strong demand surge starting in Period 26 (August), with demand peaking at 301 and settling near ~240 (Avg P27-P29: 261). The current inventory (69) is low relative to this new regime. We are in the 'Back-to-work/Pre-fall' peak identified in the carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4, starting from the spike at P26) to capture this higher mean (~232 units per period) and set sigma_hat to moderate N=10 to reflect the volatility seen across the late summer transition into this peak. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal peak solidifying: Demand in late August (P27-P29) averaged ~261 units, confirming the 'Back-to-work' transition and significantly exceeding the spring peak average (~213).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Blazer) is currently in its primary Fall/Back-to-work peak (September 9th). This regime started around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand in Period 30 spiked to 357 units, leading to a stockout. The average demand for the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 285 units. However, given the recent jump from ~240 (P28-P29) to 357 (P30), the regime is trending upward as we enter peak September retail weeks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), I am setting mu_hat to 320 to reflect the current upward momentum and setting N=4 for recent_N sigma_hat to capture the high volatility of this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work peak intensifies in September: Demand reached 357 in Period 30, with a P27-P30 average of ~285 units, significantly exceeding the spring peak.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of its Fall/Back-to-work peak season. Demand in September has intensified (P30: 357, P31: 328), with the most recent four periods (P28-P31) averaging 291.75 units. This is significantly higher than the spring peak (~213) and the late-August average (~261), indicating a sustained high-demand regime for tailoring. We are currently in mid-September, where demand for blazers typically remains strong before any late-fall cooling. Lead time remains consistently at 0. To capture this intensification without overreacting to the single highest peak (357), I will use recent_N with N=4 to set mu_hat, reflecting the current 290+ unit baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to capture the higher volatility seen during this peak (std ~59).

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work peak intensification: September demand (P30-P31) averages ~343 units, up from the August peak average of ~261 (+31%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Blazer) is currently in its peak Fall/Back-to-work season. Demand has been consistently high and stable over the last three periods (P30-P32), averaging 342 units (357, 328, 341). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing stockout risk during this high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 3 periods which define the current stable peak. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the most recent intensification of the fall season, rather than being pulled down by lower August data.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work peak stabilized in mid-September (P30-P32): Demand mean is ~342 units with low relative volatility, confirming a sustained high-demand regime for tailoring through the end of Q3.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) experienced a massive surge in Period 33, reaching 612 units, which is nearly double the previous high of 357. This suggests a significant intensification of the Fall/Back-to-work peak or an end-of-quarter push. Given that the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand (P30-P33) has averaged 410 units, I must aggressively adjust mu_hat to capture this high-demand state. I will use recent_N with N=4 to weigh this September/early-October surge heavily. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7 to capture the shift from the August baseline to the September peak) will ensure the backend computes a sufficient base stock to prevent further stockouts during this high-velocity period.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work peak intensified significantly in late September (P33): Demand spiked to 612 units, creating a new high-velocity regime (P30-P33 average: 409.5) compared to the mid-September plateau (~342).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October, following a high-velocity 'Back-to-work' peak in September. Demand recently experienced a massive spike to 612 (P33) followed by a correction to 313 (P34). The current demand regime (P30-P34) shows a mean of 390.2 with high volatility (sigma 127). Given the inventory on-hand of 203 and promised lead time of 0, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-velocity Fall regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the elevated September mean and the significant volatility observed in the last two periods, ensuring we don't stock out if demand returns to the ~400+ level while maintaining efficient inventory if demand continues its slight post-spike cooling.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work peak regime (P30-P34) established with a mean demand of ~390 units, characterized by high volatility (P33 spike to 612 followed by P34 drop to 313).

Daily Reward (R_t): $919.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (early October), demand was 283, showing a continued cooling trend following the late September peak of 612. The fall/back-to-work peak (P30-P35) has averaged ~372 units, but the last two periods (313, 283) suggest the primary peak intensity is subsiding into a secondary autumn plateau. To balance the high service level required for a $4 profit SKU against the risk of overstocking as the season progresses, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=5 captures the high-demand fall regime (starting P31) while incorporating the recent moderation (averaging ~375 units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for highly responsive inventory adjustments.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Back-to-work peak is moderating from the extreme late-September high: P34-P35 average (298 units) is significantly lower than the P30-P33 average (410 units), indicating a shift to a secondary autumn plateau.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a sustained post-peak autumn regime. Following the extreme late-September spike (612 units), demand has stabilized significantly over the last three periods (P34: 313, P35: 283, P36: 282), yielding a current mean of approximately 293 units. This indicates a transition from the 'Back-to-work' peak to a more stable secondary autumn plateau. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the service level requirement is high (80%), but the stabilization in demand allows for a tighter N to capture the current regime without being skewed by the massive P33 spike. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align parameters with the most recent three weeks of consistent performance (~293 avg). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary autumn plateau confirmed starting Period 34 (mid-October): Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~293 units (P34-P36) following the late-September peak intensity (avg ~410).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1232.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained 'Secondary Autumn Plateau' that began around Period 34 (late October). The average demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) is 297.75 units (313, 283, 282, 313), showing significantly lower volatility than the late-September peak intensity. Period 37 concluded with a stockout due to a low order quantity in Period 37 (101 units), which resulted in zero ending inventory. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the recent slight uptick to 313, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current mean of ~298 and the moderated volatility of the late October regime, preventing over-ordering from the September spike while providing enough stock to recover from the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1252.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' is currently in a sustained high-autumn regime. Period 38 (Oct 28) saw a demand of 385 units, which exceeded the set order of 313, resulting in a stockout. The secondary autumn plateau previously identified at ~293 units (P34-P36) has shifted upwards with the most recent two-period average (P37-P38) being 349 units, showing strength as we enter November. Historically, this product exhibits strong seasonal peaks followed by relative stabilization. Given the stockout in P38 and the increasing trend (313 to 385), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand environment (averaging ~315) while acknowledging the high volatility seen in the autumn season. L remains 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened variance (ranging from 282 to 385) observed in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime intensified in late October: Period 37-38 average demand reached 349 units (+19% over the P34-P36 plateau), indicating sustained late-fall strength for tailoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $804.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, moving into late fall/winter. Historically, this SKU (Mariette Blazer) experienced a high-demand fall regime (P30-P38) averaging ~357 units, but the most recent period (P39) showed a significant drop to 231 units. This decline likely signals the start of the winter downshift after the 'Back-to-work' and October peaks. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking during this transition, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=3. This captures the recent high-demand context (avg of P37-P39 is ~310) while beginning to weight the recent drop. With profit ($4) higher than holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%), but the capped policy will safeguard against extreme volatility like the 612 spike seen in P33.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift detected in early November (Period 39): Demand dropped to 231 from the late October average of ~349 (-34%), indicating the conclusion of the secondary autumn plateau and the start of a winter transition.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is transitioning from its autumn peak into a winter regime. Period 39 saw a drop to 231 units, and Period 40 followed with 278 units. The average for this new early-November phase (P39-P40) is ~255 units, a clear downshift from the late-October peak (~349). We are entering the mid-to-late November period (P41 is 11/18), which typically sees a cooling of demand for standard tailoring before any potential holiday lift. I am choosing N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to capture this recent downshift while accounting for current volatility. The lead time remains zero based on consistent history. Setting L=0, mu_hat with recent_N=3 for the transition mean, and sigma_hat with recent_N=3 to handle the shift in variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed mid-November (Period 39-40): Mean demand shifted to ~255 units from late-October peak of ~349 (-27%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Mariette Blazer' is in a post-autumn downshift as we approach late November. A new demand regime was identified starting Period 39 (approx. Nov 4), ending the high-volume autumn peak. The demand for the last three periods (P39-P41) has been 231, 278, and 245, yielding an average of approximately 251 units. This represents a ~28% drop from the late-October peak (~349 units). Since lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' (or default to 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to stabilize around this new late-fall/early-winter baseline of ~250 units, ensuring the OR backend targets the correct service level for this current regime while balancing the $1.00 holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked to 733 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales, far exceeding the recent baseline of ~255. This resulted in a total stockout. For Period 43 (early December), I expect a significant 'post-holiday' drop-off as seen in other retail cycles, but demand won't immediately return to the mid-November trough. I will use an explicit forecast to capture this transitional period. Given the massive 733 spike, a 'correction' to around 350-400 units is likely as remaining holiday shoppers continue into early December. Setting mu_hat to 400 with a high sigma_hat (120) to protect against continued high-velocity volatility while the OR backend manages the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (4+1)). Lead time remains reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (733 units), reflecting Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact on tailoring. Transitioning to a high-volatility December regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 follows the massive Cyber Monday/Black Friday peak (P42, 733 units). Demand in P43 fell sharply to 169 units as expected post-holiday. However, the month of December typically maintains some elevation due to holiday gifting and year-end events for tailoring. The mean demand for the 'winter transition' (P39-P41) was ~251 units, excluding the extreme P42 spike and the subsequent P43 drop. Given we are in mid-December (2019/12/9), I expect demand to stabilize between the transition average (251) and the post-peak low (169). Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat will capture the broader transition and the recent peak/dip for a balanced forecast. This covers P40-P43: (278+245+733+169)/4 = 356 units, which serves as a safe base_stock to prevent stockouts while reflecting recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday normalization detected: Dec 2nd demand (169) dropped 77% from the P42 peak, returning to mid-November levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (Dec 16). Historical data shows a massive spike in P42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact) followed by a normalization in P43 (169 units) and a moderate rebound in P44 (304 units). The 'winter transition' regime (since P39) is characterized by high volatility due to holiday sales and subsequent normalization. Excluding the extreme outlier of P42 (733 units), the recent mean (P39-P41, P43-P44) is approximately 245 units. Given the proximity to the Christmas/New Year period, I expect demand to remain reasonably firm but not as extreme as the Black Friday peak. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=5 (P40-P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-autumn shift and recent volatility while smoothing out the single extreme outlier through the OR backend's logic.

Carry-over insight: December volatility detected: Following Black Friday spike (P42), demand normalized to ~236 avg over P43-P44, suggesting a stable but slightly higher baseline for the lead-up to year-end.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). We are in the immediate pre-holiday/Christmas week. Historically, after the Black Friday spike (P42: 733), demand stabilized in the mid-December period (P43-P45 avg: 244 units). For Period 46, we expect a potential slight dip or stability as holiday shopping peaks and then transitions into post-Christmas clearance/lull. The carry-over insights correctly identified the normalization to ~236-244 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. On-hand inventory is currently 275 units, which nearly covers the current average demand (~244). Since the lead time is 0, the OR engine will determine the order to bring 'inventory on hand + order' up to the base stock level. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-holiday stabilization (avg ~244) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance introduced by the Black Friday spike while still weighting the recent stability.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (Dec) has stabilized at a mean of ~244 units (P43-P45) following the Black Friday outlier.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30th (Period 47). We are in the final period of the game during the post-holiday/year-end transition. Demand in Period 46 dropped significantly to 128 units, which is consistent with the year-end slowdown observed in many retail categories. History confirms a stable December regime (P43-P45) averaged ~244 units, but the most recent drop suggests we are entering a lower-demand January phase. However, as this is the final period of the simulation, the focus is on matching the expected immediate demand while accounting for the high on-hand inventory (305 units). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the sharp drop in Period 46 and the timing (Year-end/New Year), I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the decelerating trend (averaging the holiday-influenced P44-P45 and the drop in P46). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. With on-hand at 305 and expectations trending lower, the OR backend will likely minimize or zero out the final order to avoid unnecessary holding costs for the last step.

Carry-over insight: Year-end demand downshift confirmed: Period 46 demand dropped to 128 units, representing a ~48% decline from the December mid-month average (~244), marking the end of the holiday peak for tailoring.
