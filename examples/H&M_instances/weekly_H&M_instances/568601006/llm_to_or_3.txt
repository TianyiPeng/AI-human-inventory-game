Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is a women's tailored item. The current date is 2019/02/11. We have 5 historical demand data points: [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. The mean of these points is 173.4. Given the date (mid-February), we are entering the Spring season where demand for 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' items like blazers typically remains steady or increases. There is no evidence of a lead time shift or missing shipments yet, as this is the first decision. I will use the 'default' lead time (promised L=2) and calculate parameters based on the most recent 5 samples to establish a baseline. The target service level (q) is 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which the OR backend will handle using the provided \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The product is a Women's Blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demand over the last 6 periods (including the most recent Period 1) is [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227]. There is a visible upward trend in demand, with the most recent demand (227) being significantly higher than the initial average. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 207 units which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluding Period 3, visible in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we lost 227 units of demand in Period 1 due to stockout. Since the demand is showing a growth trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the more recent, higher demand levels (avg ~187) rather than the older, lower figures. This will help the OR backend set a more aggressive base stock to mitigate the current stockout situation while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). History shows demands of [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] prior to the simulation, and [227, 284] in Periods 1 and 2. There is a clear upward trend in demand, likely due to spring seasonality for tailoring/workwear in February. Total demand mean across all 7 points is ~182, but the most recent 3 points (186, 227, 284) average 232.3. Given the blazer category and the date (approaching March), demand is expected to remain elevated. On-hand is 0 because orders from P1 and P2 (totaling 443 in-transit) are not expected until P3 and P4 arrival resolution phases (Lead Time = 2). No orders have concluded yet, so we stick to the promised lead time L=2. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent growth while remaining grounded in recent data, and default for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Women's Blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demands are [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227, 284, 198]. There is a noticeable uptick in demand starting from Period 1 (avg ~236) compared to pre-game historical data (avg ~173). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a significant in-transit pipeline of 752 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (207 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 3's 'conclude' message (read at the start of Period 4). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Given the product is a blazer and it is early March (2019/3/4), we are in the peak spring transition for women's tailoring. To ensure we capture this demand despite the supply lag, I will use recent_N for demand to reflect the higher current trend (last 3 periods avg 236) and use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the observed delay.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a Women's Blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demand data provided is [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], while current session demands are [227, 284, 198, 214], showing an upward shift compared to the seed history. Average demand in the current session is approximately 231 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but Period 4's conclude message shows an arrival from Period 3 (lead_time = 1), and Period 1-2 orders have not yet concluded, suggesting lead time variability or potential loss of early orders. Since on-hand inventory is low (95) and we are entering mid-March (spring seasonality for blazers), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=4 to capture the recent session average (approx 231) and 'calculate' for lead time to allow the backend to adapt to the observed variance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring), which is currently in a spring season demand phase (mid-March). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [227, 284, 198, 214, 215] shows a relatively stable mean of ~228 units after an initial surge. Observations for Period 4 and 5 indicate an actual lead time of 1 period, despite the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, orders from P3 arrived in P4, and orders from P4 arrived in P5. This suggests the supply chain is faster than nominal. However, the orders from P1 and P2 appear to be lost, as they have not arrived despite the 1-period actual lead time observed recently. Current on-hand is 147, with 443 in-transit (this likely includes the lost orders from P1 and P2, totaling 443 units). Since P1 and P2 orders are likely lost, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation might be over-inflated, leading it to order 0 in P5. To compensate for this and the faster lead time, I will set L=1 (explicitly tracking the observed 1-period lead time) and use recent_N=5 for demand to reflect the current seasonal level (avg ~228). Setting L=1 reduces the required pipeline inventory, helping the OR engine realize it needs to order more to cover the (L+1) period window.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period (Orders from P3 and P4 arrived in next period); Shipments from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are confirmed lost (surpassed promised and actual lead times with no conclusion).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blazer. Demand history shows a shift from an initial average of ~170 to a higher regime of ~220 since Period 1. The most recent demand (P4-P6) is stable at 214-215 units per period. The Carry-over insight confirms that orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are lost. Actual lead time observed from P3 and P4 orders was 1 period (arriving in P4 and P5 respectively). Since L=1, the system needs to cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 0 and there are 443 units in-transit (ordered in P5 and P6 which have not concluded yet). Given the observed L=1, P5's order should have arrived in P6. Its absence in the P6 conclude message suggests either the lead time has reverted to the promised 2 periods or P5 is also delayed/lost. I will set L=2 (promised) to be safe. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=3) to capture the stable ~215 demand regime, covering 3 periods (1+L).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8 (April 1st). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees steady spring demand. Recent demand (Periods 3-7) has stabilized around an average of 205 units/period. Analysis of history confirms a lead-time shift: while the promised lead time is 2, successful arrivals (from P3 and P4 orders) occurred in 1 period. Crucially, orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are lost, having failed to arrive for over 5 periods. However, the OR backend still counts these 443 lost units as 'In-transit' (total 645). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to offset this 'phantom' inventory. To cover demand for the next 2 periods (Review + observed L=1) plus the 443 lost units, the base stock needs to be approximately 853 (205 * 2 + 443). I will use 'explicit' for L and mu_hat to force this behavior and ensure we don't remain stock-out while waiting for shipments that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed as 1 period for successful deliveries. Shipments from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are confirmed lost and constitute 443 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has an observed lead time of 1 period for successful deliveries (P3, P4 orders), while P1 and P2 orders (443 units) are lost. These lost units create 443 'phantom' units in the OR engine's pipeline inventory, which causes the engine to under-order. Currently, there are 871 units in-transit. Adjusting for phantom units: 871 (Total) - 443 (Lost) = 428 units actually expected (P7 and P8 orders). However, with an observed lead time of 1, we expect P7 (202 units) to have arrived during P8, but 'Period 8 conclude' shows arrived=0, and P8 (226 units) should arrive during P9. This suggests lead time has drifted back to the promised 2 periods or P7 is also lost. Demand is stable (avg ~213). Given the consistent stockouts and lost shipments, I will set L to 2 (promised) to force higher base stock and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect the current regime. To combat the 443-unit phantom inventory blocking new orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the base stock target, effectively bypassing the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: P7 shipment (202 units) may be delayed or lost; it did not arrive in 1 period as seen in P4-P5. Total confirmed lost units (P1, P2) remain at 443.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (Womens Tailoring) is in Period 10 (mid-April). Demand has been relatively stable, with recent samples [214, 215, 215, 186, 249, 178]. I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand to capture this post-spike stability, as the initial samples were quite low or erratic. Lead time analysis: Promised is 2, but observed lead time for successful arrivals (P3, P4) was 1 period. However, we have a significant issue with 'lost' or severely delayed shipments. Shipments from P1 (207), P2 (236), and now potentially P7 (202), P8 (226), and P9 (262) are missing. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 1133 units. If the OR backend sees 1133 units in transit, it will likely order 0. To force an order and account for the fact that at least 443 units (P1, P2) are confirmed lost and the current 1133 in-transit units are highly unreliable, I am setting an explicit L=2 to provide more buffer and using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate average demand around 210. For a base stock calculation covering (L+1)=3 periods, mu_hat should be 630. This parameter choice aims to bridge the gap between the 'phantom' inventory in the OR engine's view and the actual empty shelves.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period for successful deliveries (P3, P4). Shipments from P1 (207) and P2 (236) are confirmed lost. Shipments from P7 (202), P8 (226), and P9 (262) are now significantly overdue (exceeding observed L=1), suggesting a breakdown in the supply chain or sustained losses.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing severe supply chain instability. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, we have observed actual lead times of 1 period (P3, P4) and recently 3 periods (P7 arrived in P10). Shipments from P1 (207 units), P2 (236 units), P8 (226 units), and P9 (262 units) are currently missing or significantly delayed. Specifically, P1 and P2 are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). P8 and P9 are overdue based on the L=1 and L=3 observations. The current in-transit of 931 units is highly misleading as it includes 443 confirmed lost units (P1, P2) and likely more. Demand has softened recently (averaging ~165 over the last 3 periods vs ~210 earlier). I will use L=3 (the most recent successful lead time) to be safe. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the recent downward trend while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. To account for the 443 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I will set an explicit L of 4 to artificially raise the base stock level and force an order, as on-hand is only 72 and demand is expected to be ~170-200.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: observed L=1 (P3,P4) and L=3 (P7). Shipments from P1, P2 (total 443 units) are permanently lost. Shipments from P8 and P9 are currently overdue, suggesting recurring supply failure or extended L > 3.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is transitioning into late April/early May. Historical demand has cooled from a peak of ~284 in Period 2 to a recent mean of ~145 over the last 3 periods (P9-P11). The supply chain is highly unreliable: P1 and P2 shipments (443 units) are permanently lost, but P7 arrived in 3 periods, P8 in 3 periods, and P9 in 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 433 units, which covers nearly 3 periods of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 482 is composed of the 443 lost units from P1/P2 and the 39 units ordered in P11. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' in-transit units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or rely on the fact that on-hand is already sufficient. Given the volatility in lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand trend seen since P9, ensuring we don't overstock as the season progresses, while maintaining a buffer for lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered from total loss but remains unstable: P7 and P8 arrived with L=3, while P9 arrived with L=2. P1 and P2 shipments (443 units) remain lost and inflate the pipeline inventory calculation. Demand has shifted down from ~220 to ~145 since Period 9.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's blazer. Analyzing demand, there has been a significant regime shift starting around Period 9/10: the mean demand dropped from ~220 units to ~150 units. The last three periods show demands of 130, 127, and 191 (mean = 149.3). Lead times have been highly unstable: after early L=1 arrivals, we saw L=3 (for orders from P7 and P8) and L=2 (for P9). I will use L=3 for parameters to be conservative given recent volatility. Shipments from P1 and P2 (443 units) are definitively lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total (482 - 39 ordered in P11 = 443). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values that account for the expected base stock minus the *actual* functional pipeline (which is only the 39 units from P11). I target a base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Mean = 150, Std \u2248 35. Base stock = (4 * 150) + z * (sqrt(4) * 35). With q=0.8, z \u2248 0.84. Base stock \u2248 600 + 58 = 658. Since the backend subtracts pipeline_inventory (482), I set mu_hat explicitly high to offset the 443 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift since Period 10: mean demand decreased from ~220 to ~150 units. Supply chain instability persists: lead times fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods for the latest successful deliveries.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is in a post-peak demand regime. Demand since Period 10 has averaged ~152 units, significantly lower than the ~220 seen in early spring. Seasonality for blazers often tapers off in mid-May as weather warms. Lead times have been unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods); recent deliveries from P7, P8, and P9 suggest an average lead time of 2.66 periods, so I will set L=3 to be safe. Pipeline inventory is currently 815 units, but history confirms that 443 units (from P1 and P2) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 372 units (815 - 443). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I must use 'explicit' parameters. I calculate mu_hat for (L+1)=4 periods using a recent demand mean of 152 (4 * 152 = 608). For sigma_hat, I use a recent standard deviation of 30 across 4 periods (sqrt(4) * 30 = 60). This configuration accounts for the supply chain volatility and the demand shift while ignoring the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Mean shifted from ~220 to ~150 starting Period 10. Effective pipeline excludes 443 lost units (P1, P2).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a Mariette Blazer (women's tailoring). Since Period 10, demand has shifted to a lower regime compared to the early periods (mean ~160). Recent demands are [130, 127, 191, 160, 196]. The supply chain has significant reliability issues: Period 1 and Period 2 orders (totaling 443 units) are confirmed lost, as they never arrived despite a promised lead time of 2. These 443 units reside in the 'In-transit' figure of 815, but are 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 815 - 443 = 372 units (consisting of orders from P11, P13). Lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods recently. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the current stockout (on-hand is 0) while accounting for the phantom inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the max observed) and mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand regime. By setting L to 3, the backend will target a base stock sufficient for (3+1)=4 periods of demand, helping to overcome the 'lost' inventory gap.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a lower demand regime, averaging ~159 units over the last 6 periods (P10-P15), down from the initial ~220. The current period is late May, moving into summer, where blazer demand typically cools. Supply chain analysis reveals that shipments from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 443 'phantom' units in the In-transit count (815 units). The effective pipeline is actually 372 units (P11: 39 units, P13: 333 units). The observed lead time (L) has stabilized at approximately 2-3 periods recently. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the need to cover the lead time plus current period (L+1), I will set L=3 to be safe regarding supply instability. To force an order despite the phantom inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the (L+1) demand and offsets the 443-unit inventory error. Target inventory = (3+1) * 160 = 640. Current effective pipeline = 372. Shortfall = 268. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 815 in-transit from the base_stock, I need to set mu_hat = (Target + 443) = 1083 to trigger a sufficient order.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing a Blazer SKU (568601006) with a significant history of supply chain disruption. There are 443 units (from P1 and P2) confirmed lost, which the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit'. The current In-transit total is 1134. Subtracting the lost 443 units and the P11 order (39 units), we find that 652 units (from P13 and P16) are still outstanding. P13 (333 units) is now 4 periods old, exceeding the observed lead times of 1-3 periods, suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 154 units (P10-P16: 130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143, 168). To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory (443 units) and the likely loss of P13, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand window while ignoring the false pipeline. With an estimated L=3 (to be safe), and a mean demand of ~155, the target base stock (L+1) should be around 620 units. However, since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - pipeline, and pipeline is currently inflated at 1134, the engine will order 0 unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 443 lost units. I will use 'explicit' values to force the OR engine to maintain a sufficient buffer for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Shipment P13 (333 units) is now 4 periods overdue, likely lost or significantly delayed, joining P1 and P2 (443 units) as 'phantom' pipeline inventory totaling 776 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a women's blazer. Analyzing the 'In-transit' inventory of 914 units: 443 units (P1, P2) and 333 units (P13) are effectively lost or significantly overdue (P13 is now 4 periods overdue against a promised L=2 and recent L=1). This leaves an actual functional pipeline of 138 units (P17 order of 99 units + P39 order of 39 units, though P39 is also overdue). On-hand inventory is 201. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 10; the average demand over the last 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 154 units. The most recent delivery (P16) arrived in 1 period, suggesting L=1 is the current operational speed for successful shipments, though reliability remains poor. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and use an explicit L of 3 to provide a safety buffer for the backend's base-stock calculation given the high loss rate/instability, while the OR engine's internal cap will help prevent over-ordering against the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain remains highly unreliable: P13 (333 units) is confirmed lost/overdue by 4 periods, joining P1 and P2 in 'phantom' inventory (total 776 lost units). Demand regime stable at ~150 units since Period 10.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable at approximately 150 units since Period 10 (mean of last 9 samples is ~150.2, excluding stockouts). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Carry-over insights confirm that shipments from P1 (207), P2 (236), and now P13 (333) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 776 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' (914 units) from the calculated base stock. Since 914 - 776 = 138 (actual reliable in-transit), I must set mu_hat high enough to account for this 776-unit gap to ensure the engine places an order. Lead times have been erratic (1, 2, or 3 periods). Using L=2 as a conservative estimate. To trigger an order despite the phantom inventory, mu_hat is set via 'explicit' to cover (L+1) demand PLUS the lost 776 units: (150 * 3) + 776 = 1226. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to reflect high volatility and supply risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 776 units in-transit are lost (P1: 207, P2: 236, P13: 333). Demand stable at ~150 units/period since P10.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability and phantom inventory. In-transit inventory stands at 1,232 units, but historical evidence confirms that orders from P1 (207), P2 (236), and P13 (333) are permanently lost, totaling 776 units. Recently, the P17 order (99 units) is also 2 periods overdue based on the observed L=1 for P16, suggesting it might also be lost or delayed. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~150 units since Period 10 (mean of P10-P19 is ~150). To account for the 776 confirmed lost units and the high likelihood of further losses, I am increasing L to 'explicit' value 4. This effectively raises the base stock level (mu_hat calculation uses 1+L) to compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly thinks is coming. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 captures the current lower demand regime (avg ~150) across the longer lead time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 776 units in-transit are permanently lost (P1: 207, P2: 236, P13: 333). Demand remains stable in the ~150 units/period regime established since P10.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer (568601006) has entered a lower regime. Since Period 10, demand has averaged ~143 units, significantly lower than the ~220 seen earlier. Most recently, Period 20 demand dropped to 73, though this may be a single-period dip rather than a new shift. In-transit inventory is currently 914 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 776 of these units are permanently lost (P1: 207, P2: 236, P13: 333), leaving an effective pipeline of 138 units (from Period 17 and other recent orders). Recent successful deliveries (P16 and P19) show a lead time of L=1. To account for the 776 'phantom' units that inflate the backend's base-stock calculation and prevent necessary ordering, I am setting L=3 to extend the look-ahead window and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the current ~143 unit demand regime (using recent_N=11 to cover Period 10 to present). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the actual lead time plus a safety buffer, while offsetting the impact of the lost shipments.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) continues to face significant supply chain reliability issues. Total in-transit inventory is 914 units, but a reconciliation of history shows that 875 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P1: 207, P2: 236, P11: 39, P13: 333, P17: 99), leaving an effective pipeline of 39 units (which itself is likely the missing P11 order, meaning the true effective pipeline is 0). The OR backend uses the full pipeline inventory to cap orders; to bypass this 'phantom' inventory and ensure the system actually places an order, I must set the lead time (L) parameter to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the fact that on-hand (129) is insufficient for the L+1 period. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 10 (mean approx 145). Recent successful deliveries (P16, P19) showed a lead time of 1 period, though others were 2-3. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime and set L=2 (promised) to maintain a safety buffer against the observed lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory now totals 914 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17) which have failed to arrive far beyond promised and observed lead times. Effective pipeline is zero. Demand regime remains stable at ~145 units/period since P10.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer (568601006) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 141 units per period (last 13 samples). Recent demand (last 3 periods) has slightly softened further to ~103 units. Regarding the supply chain, while the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times for successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 3 periods. Crucially, 914 units currently listed as 'In-transit' (from orders in P1, P2, P11, P13, and P17) are confirmed lost or extremely overdue and constitute 'phantom' inventory. This means the actual effective pipeline is 0 units. To account for this in the OR backend (which subtracts the full 914 from the base stock), I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. This value is calculated as: ((Expected Demand per period) * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. Using a conservative expected demand of 135 and L=2, the required base stock is (135 * 3) = 405. Adding the 914 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1319. This ensures the backend places an order to reach the physical target despite the phantom data. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the variability of the recent demand regime (approx 35 units/period).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a stable demand regime of approximately 145 units per period, established since Period 10. The supply chain is highly unreliable with significant loss patterns. As of Period 24, total in-transit units are 1359. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (207), P2 (236), P11 (39), P13 (333), and P17 (99) are confirmed lost/overdue (total 914 units), as they haven't arrived within the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 1359 - 914 = 445 units (the order from P23). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed delivery times (varying between 1-3). Mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering periods 10-23) to capture the current demand regime of ~145. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect the volatility of this specific demand phase. The OR backend will see a high pipeline (1359), so the mu_hat and sigma_hat must be robust to ensure the order logic accounts for the lost units being 'phantom' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory now totals 914 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17) which have failed to arrive far beyond promised and observed lead times. Effective pipeline consists only of orders from P23 onwards. Demand regime remains stable at ~145 units/period since P10.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a stable low-demand regime established around Period 10, with mean demand of approximately 145 units/period. The current date is July 29, 2019. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' total of 1359 units includes significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P11 (39), P13 (333), and P17 (99), totaling 914 units that are far beyond the observed lead times (typically 1-3 periods). Excluding these lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is 445 units (from P23). Given the lead time variability (L=1 to L=3) and recent stockouts, I will use L=3 to be conservative. Demand mean (mu_hat) is set to 580 based on the 145 average over 4 periods (L+1=4). Sigma_hat is calculated for the same period. The OR backend will subtract the total (1359) pipeline, but since effective inventory is only 445 and on-hand is 0, setting a base stock that accounts for these phantom units is necessary to trigger a replenishment if the OR engine's internal 'effective pipeline' calculation matches mine.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 914 units in-transit are permanently lost (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17). Effective pipeline inventory as of P25 is 445 units (P23). Demand regime remains stable at ~145 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline shows 1,359 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 914 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17) that are permanently lost. The actual active pipeline consists of the P23 order (445 units). Given that P23 was ordered 3 periods ago and has not arrived, the lead time is likely L=3 or L=4. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~130-150 units) since Period 10, though recent weeks (P24-P25) show a further dip. I will set L to 3 (observed upper bound recently) and mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the post-P10 demand level while acknowledging the recent slowdown. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture current volatility. Using these parameters allows the OR engine to account for the actual demand regime and the 445 units currently in-transit while discounting the 914 lost units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 568601006 is highly unreliable with significant shipment losses. As of Period 27, in-transit inventory is 1359 units, but 914 units are confirmed lost (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17). Furthermore, the order from P23 (445 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P23, now P27, promised L=2, observed L often 1), which strongly suggests it is also lost or indefinitely delayed. This brings 'phantom' inventory to 1359 units, matching the current in-transit figure, meaning the effective pipeline is effectively zero. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 130 units per period over the last 10 periods. With 0 on-hand and 0 effective pipeline inventory, a new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (last 10 periods) and use an explicit lead time of 2 to account for the current instability, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the expected demand through the replenishment cycle despite the 'phantom' inventory inflating the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 27, all 1359 units currently in-transit (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) are considered 'phantom' inventory (lost or significantly overdue). The supply chain has failed to deliver any units since Period 20. Demand regime remains stable at ~130 units/period (avg of last 10 periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Since Period 20, no orders have arrived. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1359 units is entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from failed or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). Specifically, P23 (445 units) is now 4 periods overdue based on a promised L=2 and an observed L=1-3. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 301, likely due to back-to-school or late summer seasonality for Blazers/Tailoring, while the previous 10-period average was ~120. To restart the flow and address the 0 on-hand inventory, I will treat the effective pipeline as zero by using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I'm setting L=3 (upper end of observed) and mu_hat based on an anticipated demand of ~150-180 (balancing the recent spike with the longer-term regime). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat via 'explicit' values that exceed the current 'phantom' pipeline, I force the OR backend to place a new order despite the high reported in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 28, the entire 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units is confirmed as 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). Demand spiked to 301 in Period 27, suggesting a seasonal shift or recovery from low-demand summer weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals since Period 20. The current 'In-transit' balance of 2033 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory from failed or significantly overdue orders (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23, and likely P28). The promised lead time is 2, but recent successful deliveries had an L of 1. Since then, orders have been missing for 8+ periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive 'phantom' pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current pipeline of 2033. Demand has spiked recently (301 in P27, 251 in P28), likely reflecting late-August back-to-business seasonality for blazers. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it at 3000 to overcome the 2033 units in-transit and trigger a replenishment order. L is set to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to stabilize the window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility of the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, the entire 'In-transit' balance of 2033 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23, P28) is confirmed as 'phantom' inventory due to sustained supply chain failure. Demand has shifted into a high-season regime (avg ~275 over last 2 periods), significantly higher than the previous ~145 average.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the arrival of the P28 order (674 units) in Period 29, confirming an actual lead time of 1 period for recent successful deliveries. However, there is a massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 2033 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) that are long overdue and effectively lost. Only the order from P29 (1083 units) is genuinely in-transit. Demand has entered a high-season regime starting around Period 27 (301, 251, 231), averaging approximately 261 units over the last 3 periods. This aligns with the transition to September (back-to-office/autumn fashion). I will use L=1 (recent observation) and recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while the OR backend's inventory calculation remains inflated by the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P28 order arrived with L=1. Phantom inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) totaling 2033 units remains lost and continues to inflate pipeline calculations. Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 27: mean demand increased from ~140 to ~260 (+85%) following seasonal patterns for women's tailoring.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand remained strong at 357 units, confirming the high-season regime for 'Womens Tailoring' as we enter September. The average demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) is approximately 285 units. In terms of supply, the order from P28 arrived in Period 29 (L=1), but the order from P29 (1083 units) did not arrive in Period 30. This suggests lead time is fluctuating between 1 and 2+ periods. More importantly, the 'In-transit' balance of 2442 units is heavily inflated by 2033 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) that are confirmed lost. The only valid pipeline inventory is the P29 order (1083 units). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 2033 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a target base stock that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage PLUS the phantom units. Target Base Stock = (Demand_Forecast * (L+1)) + Phantom_Inventory. With Forecast=285 and L=2, Target = (285 * 3) + 2033 = 2888. I set L=2 to be conservative given the P29 delay.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed in Period 29 (P28 arrived L=1), but Period 29 order (1083 units) is still in transit as of P30 conclusion, suggesting L >= 2. High-season demand for Blazers (Womens Tailoring) is sustained with an average of ~285 units/period since Period 27.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a sustained high-season regime starting Period 27, averaging ~282 units/period (27: 301, 28: 251, 29: 231, 30: 357, 31: 328). This matches expected seasonal demand for women's tailoring in September. Lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (P28 arrived L=1, P29 arrived L=2). The 'In-transit' balance of 1802 units includes 1359 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) which are permanently lost. Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is 443 units (from P31). With on-hand inventory at 841 units and an effective pipeline of 443, total inventory is 1284. To maintain service levels during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the new average of ~282. I will use L=2 (explicit) to account for the most recent lead time observation and provide a safety buffer against supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P27-P31): mean demand increased to ~282 units/period (+100% vs previous regime). Phantom inventory remains at 1359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a sustained high-season regime since Period 27, coinciding with the transition into autumn. The mean demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 302 units (range 231-357). The supply chain has stabilized with an observed lead time of 1-2 periods (P28 arrived in 1, P29 in 2, P31 in 1). The current 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units matches the sum of historical lost shipments identified in previous insights (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. With on-hand inventory at 943 units and an expected lead time of 2 periods (requiring coverage for 3 periods of demand: current + 2 lead), the total inventory needed is roughly 900-1000 units. Since current on-hand is already 943 and the effective pipeline is 0, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain this buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime and 'calculate' for L to reflect the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: As of Period 33, the entire in-transit balance of 1359 units consists of historical lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) and should be treated as phantom inventory. Effective pipeline is 0.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand seasonal regime (September/October) for women's tailoring. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 612 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~300. The current on-hand inventory is 331 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1359) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target and force an order that compensates for this 1359-unit phantom deficit. Observed lead times (L) recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will set L to 2 to be conservative. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) of high demand (averaging ~450-500 given the recent spike) and overcome the 1359-unit pipeline deduction, mu_hat must be set significantly higher than actual demand. I am setting mu_hat to 3200 to ensure the backend places a substantial order to replenish stock before the on-hand inventory is exhausted by the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 33 (612 units); high-season demand for Blazers is accelerating beyond the previous ~280 average. Effective pipeline remains 0 as the 1359 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring). Current demand data shows a clear seasonal spike starting around Period 27 (avg ~350 units/period), with a significant peak of 612 units in Period 33. The last recorded demand was 313. The supply chain has stabilized with an observed lead time of 1-2 periods (P31 arrived in 1 period, P29 arrived in 2). The 'In-transit' balance of 2660 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23 totaling 1359 units) and the large P34 order (1301 units). Given the high demand regime and the need to maintain stock for this seasonal peak, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (covering the seasonal shift) and L to the promised 2 periods to be conservative. The OR engine's 'cap' will prevent over-ordering despite the phantom pipeline, but I am setting parameters to support a base stock that covers the ~350+ demand level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand confirmed (P27-P34): mean demand ~350 units/period (+150% vs summer regime). Phantom inventory remains at 1359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), which must be discounted when evaluating pipeline health.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak high-demand season (Womens Tailoring). Current demand (P27-P35) averages 333 units/period, a significant shift from the previous regime (~140). The Period 35 conclusion shows 0 on-hand inventory and 2660 units in-transit. Crucially, 1359 of these in-transit units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). The effective pipeline consists of P28-P34 orders, but specifically, the large P34 order of 1301 units is expected to arrive within L=1 or L=2 periods. Since L has fluctuated between 1 and 2 recently, I am setting L=2 (promised) to be safe. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*350 to cover the current demand regime. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to reflect the increased volatility of the high-season demand. The OR backend will subtract the total in-transit (2660) from the base_stock, but since 1359 are lost, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat that effectively compensates for this phantom inventory to ensure a new order is triggered if necessary to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains at 1359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). Effective pipeline calculations must account for this loss. High-season demand regime (P27-P35) confirmed with mean ~333 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a Mariette Blazer (Womens Tailoring), which is currently in a high-demand autumn season. Since Period 27, demand has shifted significantly upward from an average of ~145 to ~340 units/period. The latest demand observations (P33-P36: 612, 313, 283, 282) suggest stabilization at a high level, though P33 was an outlier. In terms of supply, the current 'In-transit' balance of 2660 units includes 1359 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline includes the P34 order (1301 units), which has not yet arrived after 2 periods. Given that recent successful deliveries (P28, P29, P31) showed lead times of 1-2 periods, the P34 order is likely to arrive in Period 37 or 38. With On-hand inventory at 0 and current demand high, I will set mu_hat to reflect the high-season average (~340) using recent_N=10 to capture the regime since Period 27. L is set to 2 to align with the promised lead time and recent observations. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N=10 to account for high-season volatility (including the P33 spike).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand (P27-P36) averages ~340 units/period (+140% vs summer regime). Phantom inventory remains constant at 1359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), which must be subtracted from the system's in-transit total to assess true supply chain health.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, the current date is 2019/10/28. We are in a high-demand regime for the Mariette Blazer, consistent with Autumn retail seasonality. Demand from Period 27 to 37 has averaged approximately 314 units per period (excluding the outlier of 612 in P33). The supply chain has shown some recovery but remains inconsistent, with recent lead times of L=1 (P31), L=2 (P29), and L=3 (P34). The current 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from early-period losses (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) which are long overdue and will not arrive. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. With 988 units on-hand and an estimated demand of ~314 units per period, we have roughly 3 periods of stock. Given a promised lead time of 2 and an actual observed lead time fluctuating up to 3, we must maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods. I will use the recent demand regime (last 11 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the promised lead time L=2 for the backend calculation, effectively targeting a base stock that offsets the phantom pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 1359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). High-season demand (P27-P37) is stable at ~314 units/period (excluding P33 outlier). Supply chain lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/04. We are in a high-demand regime for the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring), which began around Period 27 (mid-August). Demand over the last 12 periods (P27-P38) has averaged approximately 325 units per period. The supply chain remains volatile: while the P34 order (1301 units) arrived in Period 37 (L=3), it was preceded by lead times of 1 and 2 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units consists entirely of known lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), meaning the effective pipeline is currently zero. With 603 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0, we must place an order to cover the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) given the sustained high demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture this high-season regime (mean ~325) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (including the P33 spike). Setting L to 'calculate' allows the backend to use historical delivery data, though I am monitoring for another L=3 occurrence.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-season demand regime (P27-P38) confirmed with mean ~325 units/period. Effective pipeline remains 0 as the 1359 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a high-demand regime for the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring). Since Period 27, demand has averaged ~320 units/period (excluding the Period 33 outlier of 612). The most recent demand was 231, suggesting a potential slight cooling or volatility within the high season. On-hand inventory is 372. The 'In-transit' balance of 1359 is confirmed as 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) that has never arrived. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and observed lead times varying between 1 and 3, I will use L=2 to ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 periods. To determine mu_hat, I use recent_N (N=13) to capture the high-season regime since Period 27 (avg ~320). I will use a slightly higher sigma_hat (recent_N, N=13) to account for recent high volatility (spikes like 612 and drops to 231). The OR backend will see 1359 in-transit, so I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite this phantom inventory, or acknowledge that the 'cap' mechanism might restrict us if the backend doesn't account for losses. Setting mu_hat to cover the high demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the Mariette Blazer is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 27. The average demand over the last 14 periods (P27-P40) is approximately 321 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 94 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units consists of long-lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) and is confirmed as 'phantom' inventory. Effectively, the pipeline is zero. Because the supply chain has shown significant volatility (Lead Time varying between 1 and 3 periods), I will set L to 3 to be conservative. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the high-season demand average of ~321. Sigma_hat will also use N=14 to account for recent volatility, including the P33 spike. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period, ignoring the phantom in-transit units to trigger a necessary replenishment order.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the 'Mariette Blazer' is in its peak demand season. Demand since Period 27 has averaged ~320 units/period, despite a slight softening in the most recent two weeks (Avg ~260). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 1359 units 'In-transit', but these are confirmed 'phantom' units (lost orders from P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 and observed volatility (L ranging 1-3), I must place a significant order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the high-season mean (~315) while smoothing recent fluctuations. I will use 'explicit' for L=2 to align with the promised lead time given recent arrivals (P34 arrived in 3 periods), ensuring the base stock calculation properly accounts for the delivery delay. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture seasonal volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a massive demand surge as of Period 42 (733 units), likely driven by holiday shopping or Black Friday events (Date: 2019/11/25). This follows a high-season regime that averaged ~325 units/period. The current stock is 0. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units remains confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. No orders have been placed since Period 34, and no arrivals have occurred since Period 37. To capture the current hyper-demand spike and ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy both the new peak and the upcoming periods, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. Given the jump to 733 and the prior high-season mean of ~325, I anticipate demand across the next 3 periods (L+1) to be elevated. I will forecast an average of 600 units/period for the next 3 periods (600 * 3 = 1800). Sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect the high volatility (std dev) observed during this transition from ~300 to ~700. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Extreme spike to 733 units (+125% over high-season average), likely holiday/seasonal peak. Phantom in-transit inventory remains 1359 units; effective pipeline is zero.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/9), we are navigating the tail end of a high-demand retail season for the Mariette Blazer. Historical data shows a significant demand regime shift starting in Period 27 (avg ~340), with a massive seasonal spike in Period 42 (733 units). Period 43 demand dropped to 169, which might be a post-peak correction or stockout-driven reporting artifact. The 'In-transit' balance of 2179 units is heavily compromised by 'phantom inventory' (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23 total 1359 units) that are confirmed lost. Subtracting these from the current 2179 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 820 units (ordered in P43). Given the promised lead time of 2 and observed volatility (L=1 to L=3), I expect the P43 order to arrive between P44 and P46. With 0 on-hand inventory and the effective pipeline only recently replenished, I must set parameters to ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=11) to capture the high-season average (~340/period) while smoothing the P42 outlier, and 'explicit' for L=2 to align with promised lead time and recent averages. This strategy balances the need for stock against the risk of holding costs as the year-end approaches.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). Demand regime for the high season (P27-P43) averages ~325 units/period, excluding the P42 spike (733). Effective pipeline prior to the P43 order was zero due to sustained supply chain failures.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), we are in the middle of the holiday peak season for the Mariette Blazer. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total 'In-transit' is 2179 units, but historical analysis confirms 1359 of these are 'phantom' units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists only of the P43 order (820 units). Demand analysis: There was a massive spike in P42 (733 units), followed by P43 (169 units) and P44 (304 units). The 'high-season' regime (since P27) averages ~325 units/period, but recent volatility due to the holidays suggests using a recent window for mu_hat. I will use N=10 to capture the high-season average while factoring in the recent peak. For lead time, I will use the promised L=2 as the 'explicit' parameter because recent successful deliveries (P28, P29, P31, P34) have shown highly volatile actual lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, and the OR backend needs a stable anchor to prevent under-ordering when it subtracts the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to account for the increased volatility (P42 spike).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak observed at Period 42 (733 units); demand regime remains in high-season (avg ~325 units/period). Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 1359 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), following a holiday demand peak (Period 42: 733 units). Demand has since stabilized around the high-season average (~244 units/period over P43-P45). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total In-transit inventory is 2,179 units, but 1,359 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23) that will never arrive. The only valid order in the pipeline is from P43 (820 units). As of P45 conclusion, the P43 order is 2 periods old. Since recent lead times (P34) have shown L=3, and we have seen previous supply chain failures, I will set L=3 to ensure the backend covers a sufficient window. I am using recent_N (N=19) for mu_hat to capture the high-season regime that started in Period 27 (avg ~330), while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen during the holiday spike to ensure high service levels for the remainder of the year.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 1,359 units (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23). Effective pipeline consists only of orders from P43 (820 units) onwards. Demand remains in high-season regime (~330 avg since P27).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-180.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are exiting the peak holiday season. Historical demand has shown a cooling trend over the last four periods (average ~215 vs. previous high-season average of ~330), with Period 46 dropping to 128 units. The supply chain remains volatile; the most recent arrival (P43 order) took 3 periods to arrive. Crucially, the 'In-transit' balance of 1359 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P11, P13, P17, P23), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. To ensure the OR backend accounts for this empty pipeline and the recent demand volatility, I am setting L to 3 (based on the most recent delivery) and using a recent_N of 5 for demand parameters to capture the post-peak transition while acknowledging the recent high-variance spike in P42.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling observed: average demand dropped to ~215 units/period in P43-P46 from a high-season average of ~330. Supply chain remains unreliable with the latest lead time confirmed at 3 periods (P43 order arrived P46).
