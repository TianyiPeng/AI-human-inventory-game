Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's dressed jacket. This timing coincides with the approach of Spring and the typical 'back-to-work' or event season, which usually sees higher demand for tailoring. The historical demand data provided for five periods [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of 19.96. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised 4 periods initially), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent baseline of the historical samples provided. This will signal the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand mean and volatility while waiting for the first shipment to arrive in Period 5.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and faced a demand of 227 units, resulting in 0 sales because the order placed in Period 1 (207 units) is still in transit due to the promised lead time of 4 periods. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring). The demand history shows [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] from the pre-game history and 227 in Period 1, suggesting a slight upward trend or seasonality as we move further into February. Since we only have one recent data point (P1) that is significantly higher than the previous average (~173), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent level while smoothing out the volatility. Lead time is set to default (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/2/25). The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring piece. The historical demand shows a clear upward trend (161, 145, 179, 196, 186 prior to P1; 227 in P1; 284 in P2). The start of March often sees increased demand for professional attire as spring wardrobe updates begin. Total demand in the last two periods was 511 units, but with 0 on-hand inventory, all demand was lost. Total in-transit is 443 units (207 from P1, 236 from P2). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we expect the P1 order to arrive in P5 (visible in P6). mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent significant increase in demand (avg ~214 vs previous ~173). The OR backend will use these to determine the base stock needed to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 1: demand increased from an average of ~173 to ~255 (+47%) over the last two periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Mariette Blazer' is a women's tailoring item. Given the lead time L=4, the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until the start of Period 6 (visible in Period 5 conclude). Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and all current demand is being lost. Historical demand (pre-game) was [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging ~173. Recent in-game demand (Periods 1-3) is [227, 284, 198], averaging ~236. The previous carry-over insight noted a shift to ~255 based on P1-P2, but P3 demand (198) suggests the mean might be slightly lower or volatile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent higher-demand regime while including the lower P3 value. For lead time, there is no evidence yet that the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, so I use the default. For sigma, I will use recent_N with N=5 to include some history and capture the increased volatility (standard deviation) seen in the recent periods compared to the stable pre-game data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a women's blazer, and current dates (Feb-March) align with the spring retail season. Historical demand mean was ~173 across five pre-game periods, but current gameplay demand (Periods 1-4) has averaged 230.75 (227, 284, 198, 214). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since my Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive DURING Period 1+4=5, I have not seen any arrivals in the 'conclude' messages yet (P4 conclude showed 0). I expect the Period 1 order (207 units) to arrive during this period (P5) and be visible in the P5 conclude message. On-hand is currently 0, and in-transit is 1031 (the sum of orders from P1-P4: 207+236+286+302). For OR parameters: L is set to default (4). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the higher demand regime seen since the game started. For sigma_hat, N=4 is also used to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1: Game-start demand (avg 231) is significantly higher (+33%) than pre-game historical demand (avg 173).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees demand growth in early spring (February-April) as professional wardrobes transition. Historical demand (pre-game: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186) averaged 173. Recent in-game demand (227, 284, 198, 214, 215) averages 227.6, confirming a significant shift (+31%). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (observed start of Period 6), confirming L=4 precisely. However, we have experienced stockouts in every period because demand exceeds initial expectations and the lead-time lag is 4 weeks. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 1,018 in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P2 (236), P3 (286), P4 (302), and P5 (194). The P2 order is expected to arrive during Period 6 and be visible at the start of P7. To maintain service levels against a mean of ~228 with L=4, we need a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (~1,140 units). Since current total pipeline (0 + 1018) is below this requirement, the OR engine will likely place an order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher in-game demand regime, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promise.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a piece of women's tailoring. Current date is March 25th, entering the peak spring season for office and event wear. Historical mean demand was ~173, but since the game started (Period 1-6), the mean has risen to 225.5 (227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215). Recent demand has stabilized around 215 over the last three periods. Lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6. Currently, we have 21 units on hand and 965 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). These in-transit units are expected to arrive in P7, P8, P9, and P10 respectively. Demand volatility is moderate (std dev ~30). We will use L=4 and recent_N=6 to capture the current demand regime since Period 1, aiming to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6). Demand regime since P1 is stable at an average of ~225 units, significantly higher than pre-game history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The Mariette Blazer has shown a stable demand regime since Period 1, with an average of approximately 219 units (227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186) compared to the pre-game history of 173. The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on deliveries from Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is 121, but a substantial amount (878 units) is in-transit, which covers the 4-period pipeline. For Period 8, I will use recent_N=7 to capture the demand mean and variance since the start of the game, excluding the low-demand pre-game data which is no longer representative. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of the Spring season (April 8th). Actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P4). The demand regime since the game started (P1-P8) shows a mean of 223.5 units per period, which is significantly higher (+29%) than the pre-game historical average of 173.2. Recent demand fluctuates but remains within that higher regime (P8 demand was 249). With L=4, we must account for 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory position is 910 units (174 on-hand + 736 in-transit). Given the stable demand mean and lead time, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term history while smoothing recent variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (Womens Tailoring) has entered Period 10 (mid-April). Demand since Period 1 has stabilized around an average of 218 units, compared to the pre-game average of 173. The last 9 periods of demand are [227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186, 249, 178]. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promise). Using the last 9 periods (regime since Period 1) for demand and variance estimation is appropriate. mu_hat should target (1+L) * mean(last 9) = 5 * 218.4 = 1092. The OR backend will use these to calculate base stock, and since pipeline inventory (808) + on-hand (190) = 998, a replenishment order will be generated to cover the remaining gap to the calculated base stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a piece of women's tailoring. Current date is April 22nd. Reviewing demand history: P1-P5 (avg 227), P6-P10 (avg 171). There is a visible deceleration in demand as the peak spring season transitions. The most recent demand was 130, its lowest since the game began. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P10). I have 243 on-hand and 781 in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). With an expected total pipeline of 1024 units and lead time L=4, the system covers 5 periods of demand. Given the downward trend (186, 249, 178, 130 over the last 4 weeks), I must adjust mu_hat to avoid overstocking in the late spring/early summer. I will use recent_N=5 (covering periods 6-10) to capture this downward shift in demand (avg ~172) compared to the all-time avg (approx 199). Explicitly setting L=4 to match confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Average demand decreased from ~225 to ~172 (-23%) as the peak spring season for tailoring transitions.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'), which is part of the 'Dressed' tailoring segment. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: from P1-P8, average demand was approximately 224 units, but from P9-P11, it dropped significantly to an average of 145 units (178, 130, 127). This aligns with the transition out of the peak early spring tailoring season. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals (P1-P7 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 315 units and in-transit is 600 units (representing orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since current inventory levels appear sufficient for the newly established lower demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower demand trend and lower volatility, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the earlier high-demand peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 9-11 confirm a lower demand average of ~145 units vs ~224 previously (-35%), likely due to seasonal tail-off for blazers.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently entering May, which post-Easter and pre-summer usually sees a stabilization or cooling of demand compared to the early spring surge. Recent demand analysis (Periods 9-12) shows a shift: while Period 12 saw a slight rebound to 191, the average over the last four periods is 156.5, compared to the early game average of ~225. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from P1 through P8). Total inventory (On-hand: 284 + In-transit: 488 = 772) is high relative to the forecast. Given L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand. At the current 4-period average (156.5), the target is ~783 units. Since current pipeline inventory (772) is very close to this target, I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma (N=4) to capture the current lower-demand regime while allowing for the recent volatility seen in Period 12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 9-12 average demand is ~157 units, confirming a cooling from the early spring peak (avg ~225).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has clearly transitioned from a peak spring demand regime to a lower late-spring/early-summer regime. Since Period 9 (early April), demand has averaged approximately 157 units (178, 130, 127, 191, 160), down from the previous average of ~225. The current date is mid-May, past the peak for fitted jetted-pocket wool-like tailoring. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P5-P13 conclusions all show L=4). With 390 units on-hand and 295 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13), the total pipeline of 685 units is more than sufficient to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current rate (~157 * 5 = 785). However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the clear downward trend or stabilization at lower levels, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 5 periods of demand (P9-P13) and default lead time (4). This ensures the OR backend captures the lower volume and maintains a leaner inventory to avoid excessive holding costs as the season winds down.

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 15). The 'Mariette Blazer' is a tailoring item, which typically sees peak demand in early spring (Feb-Apr) and tapers off as summer approaches. Recent history confirms this: Period 1-8 average demand was ~224, while Period 9-14 average demand has dropped to ~164 (-27%). The last four periods (11-14) average ~169. Given the seasonal transition, I will use recent_N=6 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P10 arrival in P14). On-hand inventory is 350, with 294 in transit (from P11, P12, P13, P14). Total pipeline inventory is 644, which is approximately 3.8 periods of recent average demand. With L=4, the backend needs to cover 5 periods (L+1); 644 units roughly covers this, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the base stock level, maintaining a balance between the risk of stockouts and the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower levels: Periods 9-14 average demand is ~164 units, down 27% from the spring peak (~224).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing the 'Mariette Blazer', which has transitioned from its peak spring season (Feb-April) into a lower demand regime. Analysis of demand since Period 9 shows an average of ~160 units (Demands: 178, 130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143), which is significantly lower than the ~224 units seen earlier. Following the logic in carry-over insights, the current regime (N=7) provides a stable estimate for forward-looking demand. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 225 and a pipeline of 489 units, we have a total of 714 units covering the next 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). At an average of 160 units/period, we need ~800 units across that window. Current stock is slightly below this, and recent orders have been small, so the OR backend will calculate the appropriate balance. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stability and L=default (4).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees peak demand in early spring and tailors off as summer begins. Historical analysis confirms a demand regime shift around Period 9 (April 8th); prior to this, demand averaged ~225 units, but since then (P9-P16), it has averaged ~162 units. The most recent demand (P16) was 168. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of orders from P1 through P12). For Period 17, I am setting L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the post-peak stable regime (P9-P16). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the lower volatility observed during this period. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current lower seasonal demand while maintaining sufficient buffer for the transition into summer.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10th. The Mariette Blazer (womens tailoring) has transitioned from its peak spring season (Feb-April) into a stable but lower range for early summer. Over the last 9 periods (P9-P17), the demand has averaged approximately 157 units, compared to the spring peak of ~225. The most recent demand (P17) was 118, the lowest in several weeks, suggesting a potential further drop as summer heat sets in. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 60 units on-hand and 680 in the pipeline, we are well-covered for the immediate 4-period lead window (expected demand ~600-650). I will use a recent_N strategy (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak demand level (~157/week) and the same window for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 9-17 average demand is ~157 units, following the spring peak. Recent P17 demand (118) suggests a potential further seasonal softening.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, moving into the summer season for 'Womens Tailoring | Blazer'. Historical data from Period 9 onwards shows a clear demand shift down from the spring peak (~225 units) to a stabilized lower level. Over the last 10 periods (P9-P18), the average demand is 155.0 units. Recently, demand has softened further, with the last 3 periods (P16-P18) averaging 141.6 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (observed P14 arrived P18). With on-hand inventory at 76 and in-transit at 623 (covering recent orders from P15-P18), the pipeline is well-stocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the current post-peak demand regime (~155 units/week), which provides a stable baseline for the (L+1) period coverage. This allows the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for the current lower demand while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees peak demand in early spring and softens as summer progresses. Historical data from Period 9 onwards shows a stabilized lower demand regime compared to the early spring peak. Specifically, the average demand from Period 9 to Period 19 is approximately 151 units, down from the ~224 units seen earlier. The most recent demand (P19=122, P18=139, P17=118) confirms this seasonal cooling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P18 and P19). Given the steady demand profile over the last 11 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture this lower summer regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The OR backend will use these values to manage the current on-hand inventory (167) and high pipeline (539) against a target base stock reflecting current demand levels, likely resulting in a conservative order to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Summer levels: Periods 9-19 average demand is ~151 units, confirming a ~33% reduction from the Spring peak (~224).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Looking at the demand history for the Mariette Blazer, there is a clear downward trend as we move further into the summer season. Demand in Period 20 dropped significantly to 73 units, the lowest seen in the game history. The average demand since Period 9 (the start of the post-spring decline) is approximately 144 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) average only 111 units. Given that this is a fitted jacket, demand is likely to remain low during the peak summer months. I will set N=12 for mu_hat to capture the post-spring regime generally, but I expect the OR backend's inventory balancing to handle the low demand signal from the most recent periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P12-P16. Holding costs ($1) vs Profit ($4) suggests a target service level of 80%, which the backend will calculate using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Demand reached a season-low of 73 units, confirming a deep summer trough for the blazer category; average demand for the last 3 periods is ~111 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the deep summer trough (July) for the Mariette Blazer. Historical demand from Period 20 (73 units) and Period 21 (116 units) confirms a significant seasonal slowdown compared to the Spring peak. The current on-hand inventory is 290 units, and there are 388 units in transit, which is quite high relative to the recent average demand of ~111 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21 demand: 122, 73, 116). Current inventory levels are sufficient to cover demand for multiple periods at these lower rates. To prevent further accumulation of excess inventory and minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit), I am selecting a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current summer low-demand regime specifically. The actual lead time has been consistently stable at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will continue using the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor confirmed: demand for Period 19-21 averages ~104 units, a 50%+ reduction from Spring levels (~224). Deepest trough observed in late June/early July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a deep summer trough (July). Recent demand (Periods 20-22) shows a stable but significantly lower average (approx. 103 units/period) compared to the spring peak. The transition from late June into mid-July has confirmed a seasonal floor. With on-hand inventory at 268 and in-transit at 290 (total pipeline 558), we currently have more than 5 periods of supply relative to the current trough demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time + review period (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture this trough while preventing excessive ordering by utilizing the backend's base-stock logic. The goal is to allow existing high levels of inventory to bleed down during this slow period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a stable summer demand regime. Following a deep trough in late June/early July (avg ~104 units), demand in the last two periods (P22, P23) has stabilized at exactly 120 units. With current on-hand inventory at 277 and 186 units in-transit (ordered P20-P23), the inventory position is relatively high given the lower summer demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization around the 115-120 mark, while excluding older, higher demand data from the spring peak and the sharpest part of the summer drop. This will allow the OR backend to right-size stock levels and prevent further inventory bloating during this slow retail window for tailoring.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand stabilization: Periods 21-23 show demand stabilizing around 115-120 units, recovering slightly from the late June trough of 73 units but remaining 45-50% below spring peaks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a deep summer demand trough. Analysis of recent demand (P20-P24: 73, 116, 120, 120, 63) shows a significant softening, with an average of approximately 98 units per period over the last 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory (321) plus in-transit (196) totals 517 units, which covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we are nearing the end of July (traditionally the lowest point for blazers before late-summer/fall recovery), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this trough accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This conservative setting allows the inventory levels to draw down, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough deepened in late July: Period 24 demand (63) is the lowest recorded, bringing the P20-P24 average to ~98 units (-35% from the previous 'summer' average of ~151).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P20-P25: 73, 116, 120, 120, 63, 94) indicates a established summer trough for this blazer SKU. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 97.6 units, which is significantly lower than the early spring peak (~225 units) and even the early summer transition (~151 units). The most recent period demand (94) aligns with this lower regime. Given the current date (August 5th), we are likely reaching the end of the summer low before potential autumn restocking begins. With an on-hand inventory of 281 and in-transit units of 170 (Total 451), and a lead time consistently at 4 periods, we are currently overstocked relative to current demand levels (Pipeline covers ~4.6 weeks of demand at the current average). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture this low-demand regime and prevent further excess inventory accumulation, while maintaining the default sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility in these low numbers.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (P20-P25): Average demand fallen further to ~98 units, representing a ~56% decrease from spring peak levels. This regime has persisted for 6 weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $449.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is showing signs of recovery as we move into August (Period 26 demand was 146), following the late July trough (average ~98). Historically, this item (womens tailoring/blazers) likely experiences a 'back-to-office' or autumn transition surge starting in late August. The current demand of 146 is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this potential upward shift by using the last 3 periods (including the recovery signal) to capture the trend without over-ordering on a single data point. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25, P22 order was 0 but P26 arrival for P22 would be expected). Note: P26 conclude shows 0 arrived, which is expected as P22 order was 0. Pipeline inventory is currently 255 (P23, P24, P25, P26 orders), and on-hand is 135.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend starting P26 (146 units), moving away from the late July summer trough (avg ~98). Potential pre-autumn seasonal ramp-up.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently exhausted (on-hand: 0) following a massive demand spike in Period 27 (301 units), which is more than double the previous week and signals a robust late-August recovery/back-to-office seasonal shift. Looking at Period 26's history, the order from Period 22 (ordered=0) correctly resulted in arrived=0. Period 27's arrival confirms lead time remains 4 periods (P23 order arrived P27). We are awaiting Period 24's order (117) to arrive in Period 28, and Period 25's order (28) in Period 29. Because the current demand regime has shifted aggressively upwards from the summer trough (last two demands: 146, 301), I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this pivot while moderating the extreme 301-unit outlier. The sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for this increased volatility. I'll maintain L=4 as the lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Seasonal recovery from summer trough (avg ~98) to an average of ~224 over the last two periods (+128%), signaling the start of the autumn/back-to-office peak for tailoring.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August). The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a significant autumn recovery phase, increasing from a summer trough of ~98 units per period to an average of ~233 units over the last three periods (146, 301, 251). This correlates with the 'back-to-office' seasonal trend for womens tailoring. Lead times are stable at 4 periods (P23 arrived P27, P24 arrived P28). However, we are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) due to underestimating the speed of the autumn ramp-up. Although 621 units are in transit, we need to ensure the OR backend's target stock level reflects this higher 'New Autumn' regime. I will use recent_N=3 to capture the average demand of ~233 (146+301+251)/3. With L=4, mu_hat should target (1+4)*233 = 1165. The backend will subtract the 621 in-transit units from the calculated base stock to determine the order. Using N=3 for both mu and sigma allows for maximal responsiveness to this confirmed seasonal shift while maintaining safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P26-P28 increased to ~233 units (+137% from summer trough), following seasonal back-to-office trends.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has firmly transitioned into an autumn peak/back-to-office regime. Since Period 26, demand has surged to an average of ~232 units (146, 301, 251, 231), a significant recovery from the summer trough (avg ~98). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is recovering from stockouts in the last three periods. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The high in-transit volume (956 units) reflects aggressive ordering in Periods 27-29 to meet this new regime, but these units won't arrive for several more periods. To ensure the backend continues to place orders that cover the sustained high demand (Period + Lead Time = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the autumn regime mean (~232.25) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the current high volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized (P26-P29): Demand average is ~232 units, mirroring the spring peak and confirming a full recovery from the summer seasonal trough.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a strong Autumn/Back-to-Office demand regime. Demand for the last five periods (P26-P30) has been consistently high: 146, 301, 251, 231, and 357, averaging ~257 units. This represents a full recovery and slight exceedance of the Spring peak (~225 units). Despite a large pipeline (1198 units), the system is currently stock-out constrained due to low on-hand inventory (0 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P26 order arrived P30). To capture this high seasonal demand while minimizing further stock-outs, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the Autumn surge) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with the peak. These parameters will allow the OR backend to recalculate the necessary base stock to sustain the current sales velocity.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand confirmed: P26-P30 average demand is ~257 units, exceeding the Spring peak of ~225. Stock-outs are occurring due to rapid demand ramp-up.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has surged into a high-autumn peak, with an average demand of approximately 293 units over the last five periods (P27-P31: 301, 251, 231, 357, 328). This matches the 'Autumn peak' insight and significantly exceeds the earlier spring peak (~225). We have experienced stock-outs for five consecutive periods because in-transit inventory from the summer trough was insufficient for this rapid seasonal shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out, actual demand is likely even higher than recorded sales. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this heightened autumn regime, and increasing sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this peak. The goal is to maximize the base stock to recover from the zero on-hand position and satisfy the sustained high demand of the back-to-office season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 27-31 average demand is ~293 units, a 26% increase over the early autumn average and 30% higher than the Spring peak (~225). Sustained stock-outs for 5 weeks indicate forecasted levels must remain high to catch up with demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn peak demand period for the Mariette Blazer (Late September). Recent demand (P27-P32) has averaged approximately 301 units, following a sharp seasonal recovery from the summer trough. The system has experienced several weeks of stock-outs, though the arrival of 358 units in Period 32 allowed for 341 units to be sold, leaving a small buffer of 17 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 arrival in P32). Pipeline inventory is high (1209 units), which reflects significant orders placed in recent periods (P29-P32) to catch up with the spike. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this entire autumn peak regime (P27-P32 avg ~301) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this ramp-up. L remains at the promised/observed 4. This high mu_hat ensures the base stock level targets the peak demand, while the high pipeline will modulate the actual order size through the OR backend's capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime (P27-P32) average demand stabilized at ~301 units, significantly higher than the spring peak (~225) and summer trough (~98).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a massive autumn/back-to-office peak. Period 33 demand spiked to 612 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the previous autumn average of ~300. This follows a period of stock-outs, suggesting uncaptured latent demand. Given the current date (Sept 30), we are in the heart of the fall fashion season. The pipeline is currently 1223 units (sum of orders from P30-P33), but with the recent demand of 612, we are still at risk of stock-outs. I will shift mu_hat using recent_N (N=7, covering the autumn ramp-up P27-P33) to capture the higher mean (~353 units per period). Because P33 was a significant jump (612), I will use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (std of the last 7 periods is approx 126, sqrt(1+L)*126 approx 280) to ensure the safety stock is high enough to buffer against further spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified significantly: Period 33 demand reached 612 units, bringing the P27-P33 average to ~353 units, nearly 2x the pre-autumn levels.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently experiencing a sustained autumn peak. Historical demand for P27-P34 shows a highly volatile but elevated regime, with a significant spike to 612 in P33 and a retreat to 313 in P34. Excluding the P33 outlier, the average for recent weeks (P27-P34, excluding P33) is approximately 305 units. Lead times are consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P30 order arrived in P34). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets a roughly 80% service level. With on-hand inventory nearly depleted (14 units) and recent stock-outs, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the autumn recovery and peak) to capture both the high mean and the significant volatility introduced by the P33 spike. This ensures the base stock level remains high enough to cover the lead time demand and buffer against further volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak volatility confirmed: Period 33 demand spiked to 612 units followed by 313 in Period 34, indicating high variance during this peak season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1004.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33: 612, P34: 313, P35: 283) indicates a high-intensity but somewhat stabilizing autumn peak, with a recent average of 343 units over the last 5 weeks. Period 33 was an extreme outlier, so I am choosing a recent_N history of 5 to capture the high autumn volume while moderating the extreme surge from P33. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 and we are currently backordered/sold-out (sold 251 vs demand 283 in P35). There is substantial in-transit volume (1679 units) scheduled to arrive over the next four weeks, so the parameters must continue to signal high basestock to ensure the OR backend does not prematurely stop ordering during this peak, while relying on the cap to prevent excessive over-ordering. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (reflecting the autumn regime) to maintain a high service level ($4/$5 = 0.8 crit ratio) during this period of high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak volatility moderating: P33-P35 average demand is 402 units, but excluding the P33 outlier, demand has stabilized around 280-310 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1128.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn peak for the Mariette Blazer continues, though demand has moderated from the Period 33 outlier (612). Excluding that spike, demand have stabilized between 280-340 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P34-P36) show an average demand of 292.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, we must rely on the incoming pipeline. A transition toward late October often sees a plateau or slight decrease in blazer sales before winter logic takes over. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (averaging ~366 including the spike) which provides a safety buffer against the volatility seen recently. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture this heightened risk. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to service demand now that the stock-out period is resolving with larger arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak demand (P31-P36) average stabilized at ~360 units (or ~290 excluding P33 spike), which is a ~60% increase over the Spring peak. High volatility observed in late September.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of its autumn peak season (late October). Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 31, with a massive outlier spike in Period 33 (612 units). Recent demand (P34-P37) has settled into a stabilized but high-volume regime: 313, 283, 282, 313 (mean excluding P33 outlier is ~298). However, the carry-over insights correctly note high volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (64 units) and we have frequently experienced stock-outs during this season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given we are approaching November, we expect demand to remain strong before potentially softening in late Q4. To prevent further stock-outs while managing the risk of the P33 outlier inflating the forecast too much, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat, which captures the peak but dampens the single 612-unit spike, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened seasonality-driven variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P38) shows a high-level stabilization following the volatile late September peak. Excluding the P33 outlier (612), the demand has averaged approximately 315 units over the last 5 periods (313, 283, 282, 313, 385). As we move deeper into November (P39), historical seasonal patterns for blazers often begin to soften after the early autumn peak. However, to maintain a safe service level and avoid the stock-outs seen in Period 35-36, I will set mu_hat to reflect the robust recent average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by every shipment from P1 through P34. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable-but-high autumn demand regime while slightly filtering the P33 spike influence.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand has stabilized at a higher plateau than Spring, with P34-P38 averaging ~315 units (+40% vs Spring peak), but showing less extreme volatility than the late September spike.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a high autumn plateau. For the last six periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged approximately 301 units, which is a significant increase over the spring peak (~225) and represents a stable regime following the late September volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P37, P38, and P39). Currently, on-hand inventory is 468 units and in-transit is 986 units (comprised of orders from P36-P38). The goal is to set parameters that maintain this high service level through the end of the season while accounting for the lower volatility compared to the late September spike. I will use a 6-period recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable autumn demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at high plateau: P34-P39 average demand is ~301 units, ~33% higher than spring peak levels, with reduced volatility compared to the P33 outlier period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has stabilized at a high autumn plateau. For the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the average demand is 298 units, significantly higher than the spring peak (~225) and recovered from the summer trough (~98). Period 41 (mid-November) precedes the typically high-demand holiday season, though blazers usually see a slight seasonal shift towards December. The current on-hand inventory (641) and in-transit units (683) are healthy. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P36 order arriving in P40). I will use a recent_N of 7 periods to capture this stabilized autumn demand regime and its volatility (\u03c3), as the P33 outlier (612 units) is now outside this window and would otherwise unnecessarily inflate stock levels and holding costs. Setting L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=7 ensures we maintain the plateau service level without over-reacting to past extreme spikes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a high autumn plateau. For the period P34-P41, the average demand is 291 units. Recent demand (P39-P41) has softened slightly to an average of 251 units, suggesting the late-autumn peak is beginning to transition. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 (covering P34-P41) to capture this stabilized plateau while acknowledging the recent slight softening. This ensures we maintain sufficient inventory without over-ordering as we move toward the end of the year. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 642 units on-hand and 692 in-transit, we are currently well-positioned to meet this demand level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high plateau stabilized: Average demand for P34-P41 is 291 units. Recent 3-period average (P39-P41) is 251 units, indicating a slight seasonal cooling from the October peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2734.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 42 (Black Friday week: Nov 25) showed a massive spike to 733 units, more than double the previous plateau of ~290. This is a clear seasonal outlier related to the late November sales peak for retail. Looking ahead, Period 43 (Dec 2) marks the start of the holiday season. Historical patterns in similar retail categories suggest demand will remain elevated but may soften slightly from the Black Friday peak before another surge closer to Christmas. The current on-hand inventory is 198, and there are 615 units in pipeline. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent stockouts during the December shopping window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat (covering the autumn plateau through the holiday spike) to capture the trend while accommodating the higher variance (sigma_hat recent_N=9) introduced by the spike. This balances the risk of overstocking if demand drops post-sale against the high cost of lost sales during peak season.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand regime (P34-P42): Peak season demand average is ~341 units, but with significant outliers (P33: 612, P42: 733) demonstrating extreme seasonal sensitivity during promotional windows.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, nearing the end of the simulation (total 47 periods). Demand in Period 42 showed a massive spike (733 units), possibly a Black Friday event (Nov 25), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (169 units). This suggests the peak autumn/winter promotional period is ending or undergoing high-volatility fluctuations. In-transit inventory is very high (1209 units), including an order from P39 (468 arrived in P39, but that was from P35). Let's check arrivals: P39 ordered 0. P40 ordered 148 (expected P44), P41 ordered 255 (expected P45), P42 ordered 212 (expected P46), P43 ordered 594 (expected P47). Note that in Period 43, 'arrived=0' is expected because P39 ordered 0 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given we are at Period 44 and the game ends at 47, we need to be extremely careful about over-ordering and incurring holding costs on units that arrive in the final periods. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current plateau (averaging 341 units including the P42 spike) while sigma_hat uses recent_N=6 to reflect the high volatility (std dev is high due to 169-733 range). L is kept at 4 as per the established pattern.

Carry-over insight: Holiday promotional spike observed P42 (733 units), followed by immediate cooling P43 (169 units), indicating a high-volatility late-seasonal regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $708.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we see a stock-out after a holiday demand peak (733 units in P42) followed by a rebound in demand to 304 units in P44. We are currently in the pre-Christmas/Winter holiday window (Dec 16). The order from Period 39 (0 units) explains the arrival gap, and the order from P40 has arrived in P44 (4-period lead time). The large in-transit volume of 1739 units includes orders from P41 (255), P42 (212), P43 (594), and P44 (678). While these are on the way, the on-hand inventory is currently zero. Demand is volatile: P42 was 733, P43 was 169, and P44 was 304. Excluding the extreme spike (P42) and the following trough (P43), the baseline appears to be around 250-300 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this high-volatility late-season behavior while acknowledging the 1739 units already in the pipeline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season high-volatility confirmed: P42 saw a spike of 733 units followed by P43 (169) and P44 (304), suggesting extreme promotional or event-driven sensitivity in December.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/23 (Period 46). We are in the final two periods of the simulation. Period 45 demand was 258 units, following a volatile December characterized by a massive spike (733 units in P42) and sharp corrections. Recent demand (P43-P45) averages 244 units. Inventory is currently critical; on-hand is 0, and we rely entirely on the 1893 units in-transit. A significantly large shipment from Period 42 (212 units) is due to arrive this period (P46), and the largest order to date (594 units from P43) is due in P47. Because we are at Period 46 of 47, orders placed now will arrive in Period 50 (based on L=4), which is beyond the simulation's end. Therefore, the priority is to manage the existing pipeline and ensure that the OR backend doesn't over-order or under-protect based on the recent volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the high-plateau demand of the autumn/holiday season (avg ~295) while smoothing the extreme P42 spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the end of the year. Historically, the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) sees high volatility and spikes during holiday/promotional periods (e.g., P42: 733 units), followed by immediate cooling as the season ends. Demand for the most recent period (P46) dropped to 128 units, consistent with post-holiday exhaustion and the deep summer trough (min 60-70 units) seen previously. Given we have a massive 1681 units in-transit (partially due to previous high-volume holiday ordering and potentially covering early spring needs) and 84 on-hand, there is a risk of overstocking if demand continues to soften into January. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (avg ~230) to acknowledge the recent slowdown while protecting against remaining holiday volatility, but with zero new order intent given the pipeline size. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling: Period 46 demand (128) and Period 43 (169) suggest an end to the extreme high-volatility autumn/holiday plateau (~300+ units), shifting towards a lower mid-winter regime.
