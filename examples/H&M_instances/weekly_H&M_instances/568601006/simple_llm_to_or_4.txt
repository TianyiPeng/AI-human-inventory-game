Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last 5 periods shows a slight upward trend followed by a minor dip [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging 173.4. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is February 11, 2019. For a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this period marks the transition into the Spring/Summer fashion season and coincides with the lead-up to Valentine's Day and the resumption of professional wardrobe updates post-winter. 3. Trend Analysis: The recent demand has stabilized at a higher level (180-190s) compared to the start of the series. 4. Logic: Given the product's relevance to early spring professional wear and the moderate upward trend in recent history, I expect demand to remain strong but potentially stabilize as the initial spring refresh peak settles. A forecast slightly above the 5-period average but acknowledging the recent minor dip from 196 to 186 is appropriate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The training period shows a stable demand ranging from 145 to 196 (avg: 173.4). 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The date 2019/2/18 is mid-February, transitioning into the spring season for 'Womens Tailoring'. Blazers typically see increased demand as consumers update their professional/dressed wardrobes for spring. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: Period 1 (2019/2/11) observed a demand of 227, which is a significant jump (~30%) above the training average and exceeds the previous max (196). 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the start of the spring season and the strong momentum from Period 1, I expect demand to remain elevated or slightly increase as the spring shopping season picks up pace.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The initial training data showed a relatively stable range (145-196) with an average of 173. 2. Recent Trend: In the test phase, there is a sharp and sustained increase in demand (Period 1: 227, Period 2: 284), representing a significant break from the training mean. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: Late February is the start of the Spring/Summer fashion season. As a 'Mariette Blazer' in 'Womens Tailoring', this item is a typical transitional wardrobe piece for workwear as customers refresh their closets for spring. 4. Forecast Logic: Demand has grown by ~25% in the last week. Given the seasonal momentum for professional tailoring in late February, I expect a further slight increase or stabilization at this higher level before peaking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: demand moved from a training average of 173 to 255+ (+47%) as the Spring/Summer retail season begins.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data averaged 173.4 units. In the test phase (Periods 1-3), demand jumped significantly, averaging 236.3 units, confirming the Carry-over Insight of a regime shift related to the Spring/Summer season. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 4th. This is the peak period for Spring tailoring (Mariette Blazer) as consumers refresh work wardrobes for the new season. 3. Recent Trend: After a peak of 284 in Period 2, Period 3 saw a dip to 198. However, looking at the combined test period, the volatility is high but the baseline is clearly higher than training. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the start of March is a high-volume retail month for blazers and the previous dip (198) likely represents a temporary fluctuation within the new higher-demand regime (avg ~236), I expect demand to recover towards the recent mean. I will forecast slightly above the test average to account for March seasonality.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed a mean of 173.4. Since the start of the test phase (Period 1), demand has increased to a mean of 230.75, confirming the previously noted upward shift for the Spring/Summer season. The product is a blazer, typically favored during the transition into spring for workwear and layering. Looking at the test phase sequence [227, 284, 198, 214], demand spiked in Period 2 but has since stabilized around the 200-215 range. For Period 5 (March 11), we are moving deeper into the spring retail window. Given the slight recovery in Period 4 from Period 3, and the general seasonal alignment for 'Womens Tailoring' in mid-March, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase towards the established seasonal mean of ~230.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 173 units. Observed demand for the first five periods of the test phase (227, 284, 198, 214, 215) shows a distinct increase from the training baseline, though it has cooled since the Period 2 spike. The last three periods (198, 214, 215) indicate a stabilization of demand in the low-200s range. As of mid-March, the Mariette Blazer remains relevant for the spring transitional season and professional workwear. Given the high stability between Period 4 (214) and Period 5 (215), I expect demand to remain steady or show a minor seasonal uptick.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Following the early season spike, demand has settled at a mean of ~210 units (Periods 3-5), representing a sustained 21% increase over the training average.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173 units. Since entering the test phase, the product has experienced a regime shift. After an initial peak in late February (Periods 1-2), demand has stabilized significantly. For the last three consecutive periods (Periods 4, 5, and 6), the demand has been remarkably consistent at 214-215 units. Given the date is March 25th, we are in the heart of the Spring retail season for women's tailoring (blazers), which typically sees steady demand. The high level of stability suggests a flat trend for the immediate next period.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Periods 4-6 show extreme stability with a mean of 215 units, indicating a highly predictable mid-season demand level for this SKU.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data showed a baseline of ~173. The test phase observed a surge in P1-P2 (avg 255), followed by a stable plateau in P4-P6 (avg 215). Period 7 saw a significant drop to 186 units, falling below the recent mean. As we enter April (Period 8), we expect a slight recovery from the P7 dip due to early spring shopping and the proximity to Easter (April 21, 2019), but likely not a full return to the 215 plateau immediately. The forecast weights the recent drop while anticipating a minor seasonal lift, settling near the 200 mark.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) initially stabilized around 215 units (Periods 4-6) after a volatile start to the Spring season. Recent data shows a dip in Period 7 (186) followed by a significant surge in Period 8 (249). This surge corresponds to the start of April (2019/04/01), a period typically associated with 'Spring Racing' fashion, wedding season preparations, and professional wardrobe updates for the new quarter. The Blazer is a 'Dressed' item, making it sensitive to these events. Given the jump from 186 to 249 (+34% week-on-week), I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly stabilize as the initial April peak levels off. I am forecasting a slight moderation from the Period 8 peak while acknowledging the current upward momentum.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a training average of 173. In the test phase, demand has exhibited significant volatility around a mean of approximately 218 units. Specifically, the last three periods (7, 8, 9) have fluctuated sharply (186, 249, 178), likely due to early April promotions or the lead-up to the Easter holiday (which falls on April 21, 2019). The current date is April 15, the week immediately preceding Easter Sunday. For a women's blazer (tailored, dressed), this is a peak period for 'Easter Sunday best' or spring event outfitting. While Period 9 saw a dip to 178, the upcoming holiday typically drives a significant spike in retail traffic. Based on the pattern observed in Period 8 (249) and the seasonal relevance of the product category for the holiday week, I expect demand to rebound strongly toward the higher end of the recent range.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The previously identified stability (plateau of ~215 units) has broken. Demand has shown significant volatility and a downward trajectory over the last three periods (P8: 249, P9: 178, P10: 130). Period 10 represents the lowest demand since the training phase, likely influenced by the Easter holiday (April 21, 2019) where formal/tailored shopping typically slows down. While Period 11 (starting Easter Monday) may see a slight post-holiday correction, the current downward trend and the passing of the peak Spring 'dressed' season suggest demand will remain significantly below the mid-season mean.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed an early season peak (Periods 1-2) followed by a stable mid-season plateau around 215 units (Periods 4-6). However, a significant downward trend has emerged over the last three periods: Period 9 (178), Period 10 (130), and Period 11 (127). This decline follows the post-Easter period (Easter was April 21st, 2019) and likely reflects a seasonal transition as the peak demand for spring tailoring/blazers tapers off. Recent observations (Periods 10-11) suggest demand is stabilizing at a new lower level. Given the slight deceleration in the decline (from a 27% drop to a 2% drop), the forecast for Period 12 anticipates demand remaining consistent with the most recent performance.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed: Demand has shifted from a mid-season plateau of 215 units to a new lower range, averaging 145 units over the last three periods (Periods 9-11), a 32% decrease.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a training average of 173. After a mid-season plateau around 215 (Periods 4-6), demand saw a significant dip in Periods 10 and 11 (averaging 128 units). However, Period 12 (late April) showed a sharp recovery to 191 units. As we enter May (Current Date: 2019/05/06), seasonal drivers for women's tailoring typically increase due to spring social events and 'occasion wear' demand. The jump in Period 12 suggests the downward trend observed in mid-April has corrected. I expect demand to stabilize or slightly increase as the spring season continues, aligning closer to the established mid-season mean rather than the recent lows.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a mid-season plateau around 215 units, followed by a significant drop in late April (Periods 10-11) to an average of 128 units. Period 12 saw a recovery to 191 units, but Period 13 declined again to 160 units. The current date (May 13) is deep into the spring season when tailoring demand typically fluctuates before the end-of-season clearance. Recent data (P12-P13) suggests the demand has stabilized at a lower mean than the early-season peak. The average of the last two periods is 175.5. Given the oscillating behavior over the last five weeks (178, 130, 127, 191, 160), a forecast near the recent average of 165 units is appropriate to account for the cooling trend from the mid-season high while acknowledging the recovery from the April lows.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has shown a recovery from the lows observed in Periods 10-11 (avg 128.5). Over the last three periods (P12-P14), demand has stabilized at a higher level with an average of 182.3 units (191, 160, 196), representing a 42% increase from the previous downward trend. As of May 20th, the product remains relevant for professional workwear and late-spring social events. Given the recent upward momentum and the return to levels near the original training average (173), I am forecasting a demand of 185 units, aligning with the recent 3-period mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Following the Period 12 downward trend, demand has shifted back to a higher mean of ~182 units over the last three periods (Periods 12-14), a 42% increase from the Period 10-11 lows.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for the Mariette Blazer shows several shifts. After an initial Spring spike and a mid-season plateau around 215 units, demand dipped in April (Periods 10-11) before recovering. The recent 'recovery' phase (Periods 12-14) averaged 182 units. However, Period 15 (May 20) showed a sharp drop to 143 units. The current date (May 27) marks the transition from late Spring to early Summer. Historically, Blazers see fluctuating demand as consumers transition between professional attire and seasonal leisure wear. Given the recent volatility (196 in P14 followed by 143 in P15), a conservative forecast is required. The average of the last four periods (P12-P15) is 172.5. Weighing the most recent dip (143) against the previous recovery mean (~182), a forecast of 158 accounts for a slight cooling of demand as the peak Spring season concludes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a training average of 173. Recent carry-over insights identified a 'recovery' phase (Periods 12-14) averaging 182 units. However, looking at the most recent three periods (Periods 14-16), demand has softened slightly to an average of 169 units (196, 143, 168). Specifically, the last two periods (143 and 168) average 155.5 units. The current date is June 3rd, 2019. In the fashion retail cycle, early June often sees a transition away from structured tailoring (blazers) before the mid-summer clearance sales begin. Given the recent fluctuation between 143 and 168, and the lack of a significant upward seasonal driver in early June for this specific item, a forecast near the recent short-term mean (155-160) is appropriate. I will project 162 units, reflecting a slight stabilization around the recent average while acknowledging the general downward pressure compared to the mid-May peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a pattern of volatility with specific seasonal shifts. After a recovery in Periods 12-14 (avg ~182), the demand has entered a new downward phase in late May and early June (Periods 15-17), averaging 143 units. The most recent observation (Period 17) is 118, the lowest since Period 11. As we move further into June (2019/06/10), demand for structured tailoring like this blazer typically softens due to rising temperatures and the approaching end of the Spring/Summer office-wear season. My forecast anticipates a continuation of this lower demand regime, aligning with the recent three-period average while respecting the downward momentum seen in the most recent week.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend confirmed at Period 18: Demand has shifted from a recovery average of 182 (Periods 12-14) to a lower mean of 143 units (Periods 15-17), a 21% decrease as the peak Spring season concludes.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a lower-volume regime as the peak Spring season concludes and warmer weather sets in. Periods 15-18 show demand fluctuating between 118 and 168, with a recent 3-period average of 142 units (Periods 16-18). This aligns with the Carry-over Insight from Period 18 noting a shift to a lower mean of 143 units. The most recent observation (Period 18: 139 units) and the mid-June date (2019/6/17) suggest demand will likely remain stable within this lower range as consumer interest shifts away from structured tailoring toward lighter summer apparel. My forecast assumes a continuation of this established lower regime, slightly adjusting for the most recent data point.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (a fitted, woven jacket) shows clear seasonality. After a peak in early spring, demand has steadily declined. Analysis of the recent data reveals a downward trend: Periods 15-17 averaged 143 units, but the most recent two periods (18 and 19) have dropped further to 139 and 122 units respectively. The current date (late June) marks the end of the traditional spring/early summer blazer season, moving into the peak summer months where tailoring demand typically dips before fall collections. Given the consistent decrease over the last two periods (139 to 122), a further slight contraction or stabilization at the lower range is expected. I forecast a demand of 120, reflecting the continuation of this low-season trend.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend intensified: Demand has shifted from a mid-season mean of 143 (Periods 15-17) to a late-season low averaging ~130 units (Periods 18-19), a 9% further decline as summer peak begins.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows a clear downward trend as the Spring/Summer season progresses toward July. (1) Historical pattern: Initial training average was 173, peak periods saw 200+, but recent periods show a sharp decline. (2) Seasonal/Calendar: July 1st marks the start of major summer sales and a shift away from 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' blazers as consumers prioritize lighter summer wear or wait for clearance. (3) Recent Trend: There is a significant drop in Period 20 to 73 units, following a three-period average (Periods 17-19) of 126.3 units. This represents a 42% week-over-week drop. (4) Forecast logic: Given the sharp decline in Period 20 and the seasonal timing, I expect demand to remain low, potentially stabilizing slightly after the initial drop or continuing to taper off. I will forecast a value near the most recent observation but slightly higher to account for potential variance/stabilization at this lower floor.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 21: Demand has dropped significantly from the late-season mean of 130 units (Periods 18-19) to a new low floor under 100 units (73 units in Period 20), indicating the end of the primary selling season.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a late-season low-demand regime as the summer progresses. Recent demand shows a significant decline from the Spring peak (~215 units) and even the subsequent recovery phase (~182 units). Over the last five periods (Periods 17-21), demand has averaged 113.6 units, with a notable dip to 73 in Period 20 followed by a partial recovery to 116 in Period 21. Given the current date of July 8th, the blazer (a tailoring item) is likely moving into a clearance or low-interest phase for the summer. The forecast of 106 reflects the recent mean of the last three periods (103.7) while acknowledging that Period 21 showed some resilience compared to the outlier low in Period 20.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows a clear seasonal lifecycle. After a high-demand Spring season (averaging ~215 units), the product entered a significant downward trend in late June/early July. Period 21 (116) and Period 22 (120) show a stabilization following the Period 20 low (73). The current date is July 15, which is mid-summer, typically a clearance or end-of-season period for spring/summer tailoring. While the Carry-over Insight for Period 21 noted a 'low floor under 100 units', the most recent two periods (116, 120) suggest the actual stabilization floor is slightly higher than that initial dip. I expect demand to remain relatively flat at this new established baseline before any potential autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor confirmed at Period 23: Following the end-of-season drop, demand has stabilized at a mean of ~118 units over the last three periods (Periods 21-22 plus current forecast), confirming a shift from the previous late-season average of 130.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a stable late-summer trough following a significant decline at the end of June (Period 20). Analysis of the most recent data shows a highly consistent demand floor: Period 21 (116), Period 22 (120), and Period 23 (120). This stability suggests the SKU has reached its minimum seasonal baseline for the peak summer month of July. Given that the demand has remained identical for the last two weeks, I expect this plateau to continue into Period 24 before any potential late-August/early-fall transitional recovery begins.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a brief stabilization phase around 118-120 units (Periods 21-23), but Period 24 saw a sharp 47.5% decline to 63 units, similar to the drop seen in Period 20 (73 units). July 29 represents the end of the summer retail season where demand for structured tailoring typically reaches its lowest point before the transition to Pre-Fall/Autumn collections in August. Given the recent volatility and the late-season date, the forecast anticipates demand will remain in a lower range, reflecting an average of the recent low-demand cluster (Periods 20-24 average is ~98) while acknowledging the strong downward pressure observed in the most recent period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a strong early spring performance followed by a gradual decline as summer progressed. Recent demand in late July (Periods 24-25) hit a significant trough with values of 63 and 94, falling below the previously established floor of ~118 units. However, the move from 63 to 94 in the most recent week indicates a slight recovery. As of August 5th (Period 26), we are entering the 'Back-to-Business' and pre-fall transition period, which typically sees renewed interest in tailoring and blazers. Given the recent low average (78.5 over two weeks) but the seasonal transition toward autumn, I expect demand to stabilize and slightly increase as consumers begin preparing for the post-summer season.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend correction: The demand floor previously established at 118 units (Period 23) was breached in late July, with demand averaging 78.5 units over Periods 24-25, marking a 33% further decline as the summer clearance phase concluded.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this blazer shows strong seasonality, with a peak in spring (Periods 1-8 averages ~220), a trough in mid-summer (Periods 20-25 averages ~98), and a recent significant rebound. Period 26 (Aug 5) showed a sharp increase to 146 units, up from the lows of 63 and 94 in late July. This aligns with the 'Back-to-Work' and early Autumn retail transition where tailoring/blazers see renewed interest. Given the trajectory from Period 24 (63) to 25 (94) to 26 (146), I expect demand to continue its upward climb toward the historical training mean (~173) as the transition into the fall season intensifies.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a significant new growth phase, coinciding with the mid-August transition into the Autumn/Winter (AW) 'Back to Work' retail season. Following a summer low (P24-P25 averaging ~78 units), demand surged to 146 in P26 and more than doubled to 301 in P27. This 301 units mark the highest demand point in the observed history, surpassing the Spring peak. Given the strong momentum typically associated with seasonal launches and the transition from August into September, I anticipate demand will continue to rise or maintain its peak level as the product moves into its primary autumn selling window.

Carry-over insight: AW Season Launch Regime Shift: Demand has spiked from a summer clearance average of ~78 units (P24-P25) to a new high-growth phase (P26-P27) averaging 223 units (+185%), marking the start of the Autumn retail cycle.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered the Autumn/Winter (AW) retail cycle, as evidenced by the sharp increase in the last three periods (P26-P28). After a seasonal low in July (averaging ~78 units), demand spiked to 301 units in P27 and settled at 251 units in P28. This follows the 'AW Season Launch Regime Shift' noted in the insights. The current date (Aug 26) aligns with 'Back to Business' and late-summer/early-autumn shopping behavior where blazers are a key transitional item. While demand has slightly cooled from the P27 peak, it remains significantly elevated compared to previous months. I expect demand to remain strong but continue a slight stabilization trend towards the new high-regime mean.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a major regime shift starting at Period 26 (August 5), signaling the Autumn/Winter (AW) season launch for this blazer. Demand spiked from a summer clearance average of ~78 units to a high-growth phase. Specifically, the last three periods (P27-P29) show a robust performance with demands of 301, 251, and 231. This indicates a new established mean for the AW season, likely settling into a plateau after the initial launch peak. The current date is September 2, 2019, which is the peak period for back-to-work and autumn fashion shopping in many markets. While demand has slightly tapered from the 301 peak (251 followed by 231), it remains significantly elevated compared to the training data and early summer. I expect demand to remain stable or slightly soften as the initial surge plateaus, settling near the recent moving average of the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: AW Season Plateau Confirmed: Following the launch spike in Period 27 (301 units), demand has stabilized at a high-level mean of ~240 units over Periods 28-29, representing a sustained high-demand regime for the Autumn retail cycle.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The AW (Autumn/Winter) season is currently in a high-demand phase, as evidenced by the last four periods (P27-P30) where demand has fluctuated between 231 and 357 units. The current date (2019/9/9) falls within the peak 'back-to-office' retail window for tailoring items like blazers. While P30 saw a significant spike to 357 units, historical volatility in the AW launch phase (P27: 301 followed by P28: 251) suggests that extreme spikes are often followed by a slight regression toward the seasonal mean. The average of the last four weeks is 285 units. Given the seasonal strength of early September, the forecast anticipates demand will remain elevated, settling between the recent peak and the seasonal average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-volume phase coinciding with the peak Autumn retail season and the September 'back-to-work' period. After an initial AW launch spike in Period 27 (301) and a short plateau (P28-P29 avg ~241), demand shifted significantly higher in Periods 30 and 31, averaging 342.5 units. This represents a secondary surge in demand for professional tailoring as the season progresses. While Period 31 (328) showed a slight decrease from the Period 30 peak (357), it remains substantially higher than the August baseline. For Period 32 (Sept 16), I anticipate demand will remain strong within this new high-level regime, though continuing a very slight downward normalization from the peak rush.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The AW (Autumn/Winter) season for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-demand phase. After an initial launch spike in Period 27 (301 units) and a brief plateau in Periods 28-29 (avg ~241), demand has surged again and stabilized at a significantly higher level. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has averaged 342 units (357, 328, 341), indicating a new regime shift. As of September 23rd, we are in the peak window for transitional tailoring. The forecast assumes the current high-demand plateau of ~340 units will persist, reflecting sustained consumer interest in blazers for the autumn season.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand has increased from the initial AW plateau of ~241 units (P28-P29) to a new high-level mean of 342 units over the last three periods (P30-P32), representing a 42% increase.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer has shown distinct seasonal regimes. Following the Autumn/Winter (AW) launch in Period 26, demand established a plateau of ~240 units (P28-P29) before climbing to a higher baseline of ~342 units (P30-P32). Period 33 exhibited a massive surge to 612 units (+79% vs. previous mean), likely driven by the late-September transitional weather shift and month-end shopping behavior. For Period 34 (Sept 30), while the extreme peak of P33 may experience a slight retracement, demand is expected to remain significantly elevated compared to the early September baseline due to peak seasonal relevance for tailoring and the 'payday' effect typical of month-end dates. I forecast a stabilization at a high level, slightly below the P33 peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in the Autumn/Winter high-season regime. Period 33 exhibited a massive spike (612 units), which appears to have been a temporary promotional event or a specific seasonal surge, as Period 34 immediately corrected back to 313 units. This correction brings demand back toward the previously established high-level mean of 342 units (observed in Periods 30-32). Given that Period 34 (313) is slightly below that mean, there is a possibility of a slight deceleration or stabilization at a slightly lower level as the initial peak-autumn excitement levels out. I am forecasting a slight recovery toward the recent regime average but acknowledging the downward pressure from the post-spike correction.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer underwent a significant spike in Period 33 (612 units), which has since corrected back to previous AW season levels. Following that spike, demand dropped to 313 units (P34) and further to 283 units (P35). This suggests the outlier in P33 was not a permanent regime shift but a temporary event. Recent demand is now settling back toward the earlier AW plateau observed in Periods 28-29 (avg ~240) and Periods 30-32 (avg ~342). Given the 10% decline between P34 and P35, I expect a continued softening of demand as the initial autumn surge tapers off, stabilizing around the 260-270 unit range for mid-October.

Carry-over insight: Downward trend post-peak: Demand has declined from the Period 33 spike (612 units) to a two-week average of 298 units (P34-P35), marking a return to the mid-season Autumn plateau and a 13% drop from the pre-spike average of 342.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the significant demand spike in Period 33 (612 units), the demand has corrected and stabilized. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), the demand averaged 293 units. Notably, the last two periods have shown exceptional stability, with 283 units in P35 and 282 units in P36. As we are in late October (2019/10/21), the Mariette Blazer is in its core Autumn/Winter selling season where demand for tailoring typically remains steady. Given the flat trend over the most recent two-week window, I expect the demand to remain consistent with this established plateau.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a major peak in Period 33 (612 units), followed by a stabilization phase. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has leveled out with observations of 313, 283, 282, and 313, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 298 units. Current date (late October) represents the peak of the Autumn/Winter tailoring season, where demand for blazers typically remains high and stable before any late-November promotional volatility. The recent slight uptick in P37 suggests a firm demand floor around 300 units. Therefore, the forecast for Period 38 maintains this plateau average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a clear upward momentum in the most recent periods (P37: 313, P38: 385). As we enter November (Current Date: 2019/11/04), the demand for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' blazers typically increases due to the shift into the winter social season and preparation for Singles' Day/pre-Black Friday promotional windows. The carry-over insights previously noted a return to the Autumn plateau (~300 units), but the last two periods indicate a breakout from that level. Given the 23% jump in the most recent week and the seasonal proximity to high-volume retail events, I expect demand to continue trending upward toward the 400-unit threshold.

Carry-over insight: AW Late-Season Growth: Demand has moved from the mid-Autumn plateau of ~293 units (P34-P36) to a higher growth phase averaging 349 units over P37-P38 (+19%), signaling an uptick ahead of peak holiday shopping.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the SKU entered an Autumn/Winter (AW) growth phase starting Period 27, peaking in Period 33 (612 units). Following a stabilization period (P34-P36) around 290 units, demand fluctuated significantly with a late-October peak in Period 38 (385 units) followed by a sharp 40% decline in Period 39 (231 units). This drop likely represents a typical pre-holiday 'lull' as consumers anticipate late-November promotional events (Black Friday). For Period 40 (Nov 11), while Singles' Day occurs on this date, the primary market for this 'Dressed' blazer SKU appears to follow Western retail cycles. I anticipate demand will remain in the 230-260 range, slightly recovering from the P39 trough but staying below the mid-season plateau as the market prepares for the peak holiday season later in the month.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer in the Autumn/Winter season has shown high volatility. After a significant growth phase in late October (reaching 385 units in Period 38), demand experienced a sharp decline in Period 39 (231 units), followed by a partial recovery in Period 40 (278 units). The current date (Nov 18) is the week preceding the major Black Friday retail event. Historically, this period can see a slight softening as consumers anticipate sales, or a slight rise due to early seasonal promotions. Given the recovery trend from Period 39 to 40 and the 7-week post-spike average (Periods 34-40) of ~297 units, the forecast anticipates a continuation of the current demand level, stabilizing around the recent mean before the holiday peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows high sensitivity to seasonal shifts and promotional events, such as the spike to 612 units in Period 33. Recently (Periods 39-41), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 251 units following a late-October peak. However, Period 42 (Nov 25 - Dec 1, 2019) coincides with the Black Friday retail event. Based on the product category (Womens Tailoring/Dressed) and the previous major spike observed in the Autumn season, a significant increase in demand is expected. Applying a similar multiplier effect as seen in Period 33 to the current trend of ~250 units, a forecast of 585 accounts for the massive traffic increase typical of the Black Friday week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a massive spike in Period 42 (733 units), which corresponds to the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales week (Nov 25 - Dec 1). Historically for this SKU, a major spike (like the 612 units in Period 33) is followed by a significant drop as demand reverts toward the seasonal mean. For Period 43 (starting Dec 2), I anticipate a 'post-promotion hangover' where demand will fall sharply from the Black Friday peak but remain slightly elevated compared to the early November baseline (approx. 250 units) due to ongoing December holiday shopping for professional/dressy attire like blazers. Following the pattern of the Period 33 spike\u2014where demand dropped by roughly 50%\u2014I expect Period 43 to land in the 340-370 range, aligning with the late-October growth phase (Periods 37-38 mean of 349).

Carry-over insight: Black Friday / Cyber Monday Surge confirmed: Period 42 showed a 199% increase over the previous 3-week average (245 to 733 units), marking the primary peak of the AW season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history shows a massive spike in Period 42 (733 units) corresponding to Black Friday week, followed by a sharp 'post-sale hangover' dip in Period 43 (169 units). In retail, the period following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday surge often sees demand drop below the seasonal average as consumer spending pauses before the final Christmas rush. The pre-spike plateau (Periods 39-41) averaged 251 units. Period 43 (169 units) is a 33% decline from that baseline. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand typically begins to recover toward the seasonal mean as holiday gift shopping and party-wear demand (relevant for a blazer) resume. I expect demand to rebound from the P43 low back towards the 210-240 range, though not yet reaching the pre-Black Friday peak levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday Spike Correction: Demand dipped 33% below the seasonal baseline (from ~251 to 169 units) in the week following the Black Friday surge (P43).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong AW (Autumn/Winter) season for this blazer, with demand generally fluctuating between 250 and 350 units during non-promotional periods. After the Black Friday surge (P42: 733) and subsequent corrective dip (P43: 169), Period 44 saw demand recover to 304 units, aligning with the mid-season plateau. Period 45 (Dec 16-22) represents the peak holiday social season. For a 'Dressed' category item like a blazer, demand typically remains robust or sees a slight final lift as consumers purchase for Christmas and New Year's Eve events. Given the recovery to 304 units last week, I anticipate demand will hold steady or rise slightly to reflect the final pre-Christmas shopping peak before the typical late-December slowdown.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The AW season for this blazer reached its primary peak during the Black Friday surge (P42: 733 units), followed by a characteristic post-promotion slump (P43: 169 units). In the most recent two periods (P44: 304, P45: 258), demand has stabilized back toward the seasonal baseline of approximately 280 units. As Period 46 covers the week of December 23 (Christmas week), a seasonal decline is expected due to shipping cut-offs for holiday delivery and a general retail lull for non-gifting apparel. I anticipate demand will drop approximately 10-15% from the previous week's level.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The AW season for the Mariette Blazer peaked at Black Friday (733 units) and maintained a high baseline (~280 units) until the Christmas week (Period 46), where demand crashed to 128 units (-50% vs. previous 2-week average). Period 47 (Dec 30) covers the New Year transition. Historically, blazers (Dressed category) see a seasonal lull post-holiday as the 'party season' concludes and consumers shift toward winter clearance. While there might be a slight uptick from the absolute low of Christmas week due to the start of January sales, demand is expected to remain significantly below the Autumn plateau. I forecast a slight recovery to 148 units, reflecting continued late-season weakness.
