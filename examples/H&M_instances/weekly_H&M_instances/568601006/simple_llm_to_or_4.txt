SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data ([161, 145, 179, 196, 186]) shows a generally upward trend over the last five observations, with the average demand for the period sitting at approximately 173 units. The current date (February 11, 2019) is mid-February, which is a transition period into Spring fashion. As a blazer ('Womens Tailoring' / 'Dressed'), the item is highly relevant for professionals returning to work/office routines after winter breaks and for spring layering. The most recent observation (186) indicates sustained interest compared to the start of the window. Given the upward trajectory and the seasonal shift towards professional/tailored wear in mid-February, I expect the demand to remain high or slightly increase.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Analysis of Historical Data: Training demand (Periods -5 to -1) averaged 173 units with a range of 145-196. Period 1 observed demand was 227 units. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The date 2019/02/18 falls in late winter/early spring. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this product typically sees increased demand as professional and formal spring wardrobes are refreshed. mid-February often marks the start of the spring fashion season. 3. Trend Analysis: The jump from the historical average of 173 to 227 (+31%) in Period 1 indicates a significant upward shift, likely the start of a seasonal peak for formal wear. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the strong momentum from Period 1 and the alignment with spring shopping behavior, I expect demand to remain at this higher level or increase slightly as the season progresses. I will forecast a continuation of the high demand observed in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Numerical Analysis: Historical training data showed a mean of 173.4. However, the first two periods of the test phase show a significant jump to 227 and 284 respectively, indicating a sharp upward trend. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: Late February marks the transition toward Spring/Summer fashion seasons. Use of the 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed) typically increases during this transition as consumers refresh professional wardrobes for the new season. 3. Recent Trend: The demand grew by ~25% from Period 1 to Period 2. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the clear upward momentum and seasonal alignment, I expect demand to continue increasing, though at a slightly moderated rate as it stabilizes at a new higher level.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift starting 2019/2/11: Mean increased from 173 to ~255 (+47%) over the first two periods of the test phase, driven by spring seasonality for tailoring.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 173 units. Since moving into the 'Test Phase' (starting 2019/2/11), there has been a clear regime shift upward, as noted in the Carry-over Insights, likely due to spring seasonality for women's tailoring (the Mariette Blazer). Recent demand in the test phase has been 227, 284, and 198. While Period 3 saw a dip to 198, the average of the test phase remains higher than the training period (Avg: 236 vs 173). March (Current Date: 2019/3/4) typically sees strong demand for professional/dressed apparel as consumers refresh wardrobes for spring. Period 3's drop might be a weekly fluctuation rather than a trend reversal. I expect demand to stabilize around the current test-phase mean, slightly adjusting for the recent dip.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173. Upon entering the test phase (Feb 11), a clear regime shift occurred with the test average rising to approximately 231 (+33%). While there was a significant peak in Period 2 (284), demand in the most recent two periods has stabilized at an average of 206 (198 and 214). Given that we are now in mid-March, a peak period for spring tailoring and transitional garments like blazers, I expect demand to maintain this higher baseline or slightly increase from the previous week. I am forecasting a slight upward movement from the most recent period to reflect seasonal momentum.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173. The test phase observed a significant upward shift in demand, initially peaking in Period 2 (284) before stabilizing over the last three periods (P3: 198, P4: 214, P5: 215). The average demand over the last three weeks is approximately 209, which is a sustained 21% increase over the training period mean. As the current date (March 18) marks the height of the spring tailoring season for items like feminine blazers, demand is expected to remain strong and show slight growth from the recent stability. The forecast weights the most recent two periods (avg 214.5) while expecting a minor seasonal increase.

Carry-over insight: Revised demand regime: Demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~210 (P3-P5 average) compared to the training mean of 173, confirming a sustained +21% shift for the spring season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) increased from a training average of 173 to a test phase average of ~225. Analysis of the most recent four periods (P3-P6) shows remarkable stability, with demand levels of 198, 214, 215, and 215 respectively. The current date (March 25th) is a peak period for spring professional wear as temperatures rise and the spring retail season is in full swing. Given the extreme consistency of the last three periods (all ~215), there is no evidence of a tapering off or a further spike. I will forecast a continuation of this stable plateau.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the training period averaged 173 units. Since the start of the spring season (test phase), demand shifted to a higher mean, peaking at 284 in Period 2 but then stabilizing around 215 units from Periods 4-6. Period 7 (March 25th) showed a notable dip to 186 units (-13.5% vs the stable mean). The current period is April 1st. In the apparel industry, a blazer (Womens Tailoring) usually sees a slight softening after the initial spring launch spike as customers pivot toward lighter late-spring/summer wear, or it may experience a minor uptick if there is a pre-Easter shopping lift. Given the drop in Period 7 and the historical performance, I anticipate demand will either stabilize or slightly recover from the dip. I forecast a demand of 195 units, reflecting a cautious recovery from last week's low while acknowledging the end of the initial spring surge.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer (Mariette Blazer) showed a training average of 173 units. Since entering the spring season (mid-February), the demand shifted upward, establishing a new regime. Over the last 6 periods (P3-P8), demand has averaged approximately 213 units. The most recent period (P8, 2019/04/01) saw a significant jump to 249 units. Given the date (April 8th), we are entering the peak season for women's tailored 'dressed' items like blazers, which are popular for spring events, graduations, and office wear transitions. While P8 might be a slight outlier or an early peak, the overall trend remains strong and stable above the baseline. I expect demand to remain high but potentially settle slightly from the P8 peak, aligning with the established higher-demand spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Established spring demand regime confirmed: Average demand from P3 to P8 is ~213 units, representing a sustained 23% increase over the training baseline of 173.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) shows a training average of 173 units. Since the start of the test phase (Feb 11), a shift to a higher spring regime has been observed, with a mean of approximately 218 units (P1-P9). The current date is April 15, 2019. In retail, mid-April often sees a slight dip following early spring/Easter promotions (as seen in the Period 9 drop to 178), but demand for women's 'Dressed' tailoring generally stays buoyant through May for spring social events and transition-to-work wardrobes. Recent data shows significant volatility (P8: 249, P9: 178), suggesting a zigzag pattern or reaction to specific promotions. Given the P3-P9 average is 208, and accounting for the recent correction, I expect demand to revert toward the established spring mean of ~200-210.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong 'Spring tailoring' regime from mid-February through March, with demand averaging approximately 213 units. However, recent data indicates a sharp downturn in April: Period 9 (178 units) and Period 10 (130 units) are significantly lower than the previous regime mean. This downtrend aligns with the typical post-Easter cooling period (Easter Sunday was April 21, 2019). Period 11 (April 22-28) is the week immediately following Easter, where retail demand for structured tailoring typically stays low or continues to decline as the season transitions toward lighter summer apparel. The forecast anticipates demand will remain near the previous week's low, reflecting the conclusion of the peak spring shopping cycle.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a sustained spring regime (Periods 1-8) averaging around 223 units. However, we are witnessing a significant regime shift starting from Period 9. The last three periods (9, 10, 11) have seen demands of 178, 130, and 127, respectively. The average of the most recent two weeks (128.5) is 42% lower than the earlier spring peak. This decline aligns with the end of the peak 'spring blazer' season as we move into May, where demand for heavier woven tailoring often decreases in favor of summer-focused attire. Given the stability between Period 10 and 11, the demand appears to have found a new, lower floor. I expect demand for Period 12 (Apr 29) to remain consistent with this recent low-level stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Downshift in demand regime confirmed starting Period 10: Demand has significantly dropped from the spring average of ~220 to a new floor of ~128 (-42%) over the last two periods, signaling the end of the peak spring tailoring season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for the Mariette Blazer shows high volatility. After a sustained spring peak (Periods 1-8 avg: ~213), demand dropped sharply in Period 10 (130) and Period 11 (127), which was identified in previous insights as a potential seasonal downshift. However, Period 12 (April 29) saw a significant rebound to 191 units (+50% vs P11). This jump likely reflects early May retail drivers such as Mother's Day (May 12, 2019) or late spring social events where 'dressed' tailoring is relevant. For Period 13 (May 6), I expect demand to remain elevated relative to the April lows but potentially soften slightly from the immediate spike in P12 as the peak purchasing for early May events concludes. A forecast of 172 aligns with the broader historical average and the recent upward correction.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer showed a strong spring peak (Periods 1-9 avg ~218) followed by a sharp drop in mid-April (Periods 10-11 avg ~128). However, the most recent data (Periods 12-13) shows a recovery with demand levels around 191 and 160 units (avg 175). This indicates that while the peak spring season has passed, there is a secondary level of demand as we move into mid-May, perhaps driven by late spring events or office wear needs. The training mean was 173. Recent demand (last two weeks) averages 175.5. Given the dates (mid-May), I expect demand to continue trending slightly lower than the spring peak but stabilize around the historical baseline.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization after spring peak: Demand has settled into a secondary plateau (Periods 12-13 avg ~175) following the late-April dip, aligning closely with the long-term training baseline of 173.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a high spring peak (avg ~213) which subsided in early April. However, recent data (Periods 12-14) shows a notable recovery and stabilization. Period 12: 191, Period 13: 160, Period 14: 196. The current average over the last three periods is approximately 182 units, which is slightly above the training baseline (173) and much higher than the mid-April dip (128). The date (May 20) aligns with late-spring demand for 'Dressed' products suitable for office wear or graduations. Current demand is following a stable-to-slightly-positive trend compared to the training mean. I forecast a demand of 184 units, reflecting a slight moderation from the last peak but maintaining the current late-spring baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer showed a high spring peak (avg ~213) followed by a dip in late April (avg ~128). Over the most recent four periods (P12-P15), demand has stabilized around a mean of 172.5 (191, 160, 196, 143), which aligns closely with the original training baseline of 173. The most recent observation (143) is on the lower end of this range, but there is no evidence of a sustained downward trend below the baseline. Given the date (late May), we are moving into a stable early-summer period for women's tailoring where demand typically fluctuates around the long-term average. The forecast uses the recent 4-period moving average (approx 173) while acknowledging the latest fluctuation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. During the peak spring season (Feb-April), demand averaged ~215. As we transitioned into late May and early June, demand has stabilized into a lower, post-peak plateau. The average demand over the last five periods (P12-P16) is 171.6, which aligns almost perfectly with the initial training baseline of 173 and the carry-over insight from Period 14. The most recent observations (143 and 168) suggest a slight softening but no catastrophic drop. For June 3rd, we are moving further into the summer season where demand for 'Woven Tailoring' usually plateaus or slightly softens. Given the recent cluster around the 160-170 range, I am forecasting a slight regression toward the established baseline mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer (SKU 568601006) showed a spring peak (P1-P8 avg ~220) followed by a transition period. Recent data (P13-P17) shows a softening trend as the season moves into early summer: 196, 143, 168, 118. The most recent period (P17) saw a significant drop to 118, which is well below the training baseline of 173 and the stabilization average of 175 noted in P14. This decline likely reflects reduced demand for 'Womens Tailoring' (Blazer) as summer heat increases in June. Given the volatile but generally downward trend over the last four weeks (avg ~145 in P15-P17), the forecast anticipates continued low demand but with a slight stabilization near the P17 floor.

Carry-over insight: Summer contraction confirmed: Demand has shifted from a benchmark of ~175 (P12-P14) to a lower summer regime averaging ~143 over the last three periods (P15-P17), a -18% decrease.

The last four periods (P15-P18) have averaged 142 units (143, 168, 118, 139), representing a contraction as demand for structured blazers typically softens in mid-June. The most recent demand was 139, which aligns closely with this established summer mean of ~143. I expect demand to remain stable within this lower-volume range for the upcoming period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 17-19) shows values of 118, 139, and 122, with an average of 126 units. This indicates a deepening of the summer seasonal contraction previously identified in Period 18 (which estimated a mean of ~143). As of June 24th, we are in the peak summer period where demand for structured, woven blazers typically reaches its seasonal floor. The forecast honors the latest 3-period trend (~126) while recognizing that demand has consistently stayed below the 140-unit mark for two of the last three weeks, suggesting a stabilization at this lower summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor established: Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has further declined from the mid-140s to an average of ~126 (-12% from the P15-P17 sub-period), reflecting peak summer seasonality for tailoring.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle for the Mariette Blazer, a lined woven jacket. Demand peaked in early spring (P1-P9 avg ~220) and has steadily declined through the summer months. The current date, July 1st, represents the peak of summer, where demand for structured, lined tailoring is traditionally at its lowest. Last period (P20) saw a significant drop to 73 units. While P20 might be a slight outlier on the low side, the moving average for the last four periods (P17-P20) is 113. Given the peak summer seasonality, I expect demand to remain depressed, likely stabilizing slightly above the P20 low but well below the spring baseline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand floor confirmed: As of Period 21 (July 1st), demand has hit a seasonal trough, with the last 4 periods averaging 113 units, a ~35% decrease from the original training baseline of 173.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this blazer. Following the spring peak (averaging ~213 units), demand shifted downward in the summer months. Recent performance (Periods 17-21) shows a low-demand regime averaging 113.6 units. Period 20's sharp drop to 73 appears to be a transitory trough, as Period 21 recovered to 116. Given the date is July 8th, we are in the peak of the summer clearance/off-season for structured tailoring. Demand is expected to remain stable at this established mid-summer floor (approximately 110-120 units) before any potential autumn recovery. I will forecast a value close to the recent Period 21 result and the 4-period average.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Womens Tailoring' blazer shows a strong seasonal contraction throughout the summer months. Following a spring peak (avg ~213), demand dropped to a summer floor. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) have recorded 73, 116, and 120 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 103 units. While P20 was a significant outlier (73), P21 and P22 show relative stability around the 116-120 range. At mid-July (2019/7/15), the market is still in the peak summer period where demand for structured tailoring typically remains low before the late-summer 'back-to-office' or autumn transition begins. Given the slight stabilization over the last two weeks, the forecast remains near the recent average of 118, anticipating a slight uptick as the market moves away from the extreme low of June/July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the product (Mariette Blazer) has transitioned from a high spring peak (~213 units) into a significantly lower mid-summer regime. The carry-over insights correctly identified a seasonal trough starting in late June, with Period 21 establishing a 'floor' average of 113 units. Recent data for Periods 21, 22, and 23 shows remarkable stability with demands of 116, 120, and 120 respectively. This indicates that the downward trend has halted and the demand has stabilized at this lower summer baseline. Given the date (July 22nd) is still within the peak summer period where demand for tailoring/blazers typically remains flat before late-summer/autumn interest begins, the forecast maintains the current stable plateau of ~120 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant downward shift in demand for this blazer throughout the summer. The training baseline was 173 units, but current carry-over insights and recent data indicate a much lower seasonal floor. Specifically, from P21 to P24, the demand has fluctuated significantly around a very low average of ~105 units. Period 24 (July 22nd) saw a sharp drop to 63 units, which is consistent with the late-July performance observed in Period 20 (73 units). These intermittent dips suggest high sensitivity to summer clearance activities or extreme low-interest weeks for heavy tailoring. Given that we are now on July 29th, entering the transition toward late summer/pre-fall, I expect demand to hover near this established summer floor but potentially see a minor recovery from the outlier-low of 63, though it will likely remain well below the 120-unit resistance level seen in P22-P23.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this blazer. Following the spring peak (avg ~213) and a mid-summer trough (avg ~113), the most recent five periods (P21-P25) have averaged 102.6 units, indicating continued weakness in late July/early August. Period 24 saw a significant dip to 63, followed by a slight recovery to 94 in Period 25. As of August 5th (Period 26), we are entering the 'Back to Work' and transition-to-autumn season in retail, where tailoring demand typically begins to recover from summer lows. While the immediate trend is volatile (120, 120, 63, 94), the broader mid-summer average (~100-110) serves as the current floor. For Period 26, I expect a slight upward movement as seasonal interest in professional attire begins its gradual climb for fall, but I remain conservative given the weak momentum throughout July.

Carry-over insight: Early August transition: Demand is stabilizing at a low summer floor with a 5-period average (P21-P25) of ~103 units, representing a 40% reduction from the initial training baseline of 173.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a spring peak (~215 units) followed by a summer decline to a trough of ~103 units (P21-P25 average). Current date (August 12) marks the transition into the 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn retail season. Period 26 showed a significant jump to 146 units (+55% from P25), indicating that the seasonal recovery is beginning as consumers shift from summer apparel to tailored items like the Mariette Blazer. Given the date is now mid-August, I expect this upward momentum to continue toward the historical baseline of 173.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a low summer trough from July through early August (P21-P25) averaging ~103 units. However, we have observed a significant regime shift starting in Period 26 (146 units) and exploding in Period 27 (301 units, dated 2019/8/12). This trajectory strongly indicates the start of the 'Back-to-Work' or 'Autumn Transition' season, where demand for tailored items like the Mariette Blazer spikes as consumers refresh their professional wardrobes for late August and September. Given the 106% jump from P26 to P27, demand is currently in a high-growth momentum phase. While P27 was extremely high, historical tailoring peaks (like P2) suggest a potential for sustained high volume before stabilization. I expect demand to remain elevated but slightly pull back or stabilize after the initial surge.

Carry-over insight: Early Autumn Transition Confirmed: Significant demand surge starting P26 (Aug 5th), with Period 27 (Aug 12th) reaching 301 units, a 192% increase over the summer average (~103), signaling the start of the high-demand back-to-work season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailored blazer shows clear seasonality: a spring peak (Feb-March), a significant summer trough (June-July), and a strong autumn recovery starting in August. We are currently in the 'back-to-work' season (Late August). Analysis of the recent trend shows a massive surge starting at P26 (146 units), peaking at P27 (301 units), and slightly tempering at P28 (251 units). Period 29 (August 26th) falls exactly at the end-of-summer transition when professional tailoring demand remains elevated for the new work season. Given the three-week trend (avg 233) and the high seasonality evidence from P27 and P28, I expect demand to remain in this high regime but continue the slight natural normalization from the initial P27 peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-work peak confirmed: Demand has shifted from a summer average of ~103 to a new high-demand regime averaging ~233 (+126%) over the last three periods (P26-P28).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift beginning in Period 26. The training baseline (173) and summer trough (~103) have been replaced by an autumn 'back-to-work' surge as observed in the last three periods (P27-P29: 301, 251, 231). This period (Sept 2nd) marks the peak of the autumn transition. While the initial surge (301) has cooled slightly, demand remains high and stable around a new mean of ~240-260 units. Period 29 (231) shows a slight deceleration, but given the seasonal context of the 'Mariette Blazer' (a professional/dressed garment) coinciding with early September, demand is expected to remain consistent with the recently established high-demand regime rather than reverting.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal surge starting in August (P27), corresponding with the 'back-to-work' period for tailoring. Recent demand (P27-P30) has averaged 285 units, with P30 (Sept 2nd) hitting a new peak of 357 units. This suggests that the early September period is the apex of the autumn demand cycle for blazers. As we move into the second week of September (P31), demand is expected to remain significantly elevated compared to the summer and even the spring peaks, though it may stabilize slightly below the P30 spike.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak intensified: The first week of September (P30) reached a period-high of 357 units, lifting the current high-demand regime average to ~285 units (P27-P30), representing a 65% increase over the original training baseline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows strong seasonal sensitivity. After a summer trough (avg ~103), demand entered a 'back-to-work' autumn surge starting in early August (Period 26). The last five periods (P27-P31) have established a high-demand regime with an average of ~294 units. Periods 30 and 31 (early September) showed peak intensity at 357 and 328 units respectively. As we move into mid-September (Period 32, 2019/09/16), the 'back-to-work' initial rush typically stabilizes or slightly softens from the absolute peak but remains significantly elevated compared to both the summer floor and the training baseline (173). Given the recent momentum (357 -> 328), a slight downward normalization is expected, but demand will likely remain above 300.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization: Demand for mid-September (P30-P31) has averaged 342 units, confirming a plateau at roughly 2x the original training baseline (173), as peak 'back-to-work' demand holds steady.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed a training baseline of 173. Following a significant summer trough (~103 units), demand surged in August due to the 'back-to-work' season. Over the last three periods (P30-P32), demand has stabilized at an Autumn peak plateau, with observations of 357, 328, and 341 units (average 342). For the current period (September 23), the blazer remains highly seasonally relevant for late-September dressing. Demand is expected to remain firm within this established high-demand regime before any eventual seasonal transition in October.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern related to 'back-to-work' windows (Spring and Autumn). After a Summer low (avg ~103), demand surged in August and September. Specifically, Period 33 (Sept 23rd) saw a massive spike to 612 units. This aligns with a typical 'Payday' weekend effect (last Friday of September fell on Sept 27th) combined with peak Autumn tailoring interest. However, a jump of 80% over the previous period's high plateau (P30-P32 avg ~342) is often an outlier or a temporary peak rather than a new sustained floor. For Period 34 (Sept 30th), I expect demand to revert from the extreme spike toward the established high-autumn plateau, likely resting between the 340s baseline and the 612 peak, as early October remains high-season but loses the concentrated end-of-month 'payday' momentum.

Carry-over insight: Exceptional Autumn peak confirmed: Demand reached a record high of 612 units in Period 33 (late Sept), nearly doubling the previous high-demand regime average (~342), likely driven by end-of-month pay cycles and peak seasonal demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong Autumn/back-to-work regime established since Period 27. Demand peaked exceptionally in Period 33 (612 units), likely driven by end-of-month effects and seasonal intensity, before returning to a baseline level of 313 in Period 34. This 313 figure is consistent with the plateau observed between Periods 30-32 (average ~342). For Period 35 (Oct 7), I expect demand to remain in this high-activity plateau as blazers are core wardrobe items for October, though slightly tapering from the extreme September highs. I will forecast a value near the recent non-outlier average (~335) but adjusted for the minor downward movement seen in P34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:

Historical data shows a significant autumn peak that culminated in Period 33 (612 units). Since then, demand has entered a cooling phase, with Period 34 (313) and Period 35 (283) showing a consistent week-on-week decline of approximately 10%. As we move into mid-October (Period 36), the initial 'back-to-work' surge for women's tailoring is tapering off. Given the recent downward trend from the September plateau (~340 units) to the current levels, I expect a further moderate decline in demand to around 260 units, maintaining the recent trajectory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for the 'Mariette Blazer' shows a distinct transition from the summer trough (~103 units) into a high-demand autumn 'back-to-work' regime. Following an exceptional spike in late September (Period 33: 612 units), demand has corrected and stabilized over the last three periods (P34-P36) at an average of 293 units (313, 283, 282). This new plateau is approximately 70% higher than the original training baseline (173), reflecting sustained seasonal relevance for tailoring in October. For Period 37 (October 21st), demand is expected to remain consistent with this recent stabilization trend as we move towards late October. There is no evidence of a further downward shift yet, though the extreme volatility of late September has subsided.

Carry-over insight: Autumn stability confirmed: Following the late-Sept peak, demand has settled into a consistent high-usage plateau averaging 293 units over the last three periods (P34-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:

Following the exceptional peak in late September (P33: 612), demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized into a consistent Autumn plateau. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged approximately 298 units, significantly higher than the training baseline of 173. The most recent observation (P37: 313) shows a slight uptick as we reach the end of October. Given that the current date (Oct 28) coincides with the end-of-month pay cycle\u2014a time that previously triggered a massive spike in P33\u2014there is potential for elevated demand, although the recent trend suggests it will likely remain within the established 280-320 range rather than repeating an extreme outlier.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for the Mariette Blazer has remained robust throughout the autumn season, significantly exceeding the initial training baseline of 173. Recent performance shows a stable plateau from P34-P37 (averaging ~298 units), followed by a notable increase in P38 (385 units) likely driven by month-end shopping. As we move into the first week of November (P39), demand is expected to remain high due to continued seasonal relevance for tailoring. While P38 likely captured a month-end peak, the underlying trend suggests a sustained engagement level. I expect demand to moderate slightly from the P38 peak but remain above the P34-P37 average as the pre-holiday shopping season begins to build.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn surge: Demand has increased from the previously established plateau of ~293 to a higher range, with P38 reaching 385 (+31%), signaling continued strength in the tailoring category entering November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong autumn regime with demand stabilizing at a high plateau (averaging approx 293 between P34-P36). The end of October (P38) saw a surge to 385 units, likely influenced by the Oct payday cycle and preparations for winter dressing. Period 39 (early November) dropped to 231 units. This decline is consistent with the post-payday lull observed after similar spikes (e.g., the drop from P33 to P34). Given the current date is Nov 11, we are in a mid-month period where tailoring demand typically remains robust but lacks the month-end impulse or the massive 'Black Friday' push which occurs later in November. I anticipate demand will recover slightly from the P39 low as it returns toward the established autumn baseline of ~290, but stay well below the recent P38 peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has transitioned from an exceptionally strong autumn peak (Avg ~342 in Sept) into a slightly lower but stable late-autumn plateau. Recent demand over the last two periods (P39: 231, P40: 278) shows a recovery from a brief dip and averages 254.5 units. The current date (Nov 18) marks the week immediately preceding the Black Friday promotional period. In retail tailoring, this period typically sees a mix of steady demand for holiday events and a slight 'calm before the storm' as consumers anticipate sales. Given the upward trajectory from P39 to P40 and the established autumn stability around the 275-300 range, a forecast slightly above the recent two-week average is appropriate to account for the start of pre-Black Friday shopping momentum.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer showed a strong autumn peak (averaging ~340 in September) before settling into a consistent range. Over the most recent three periods (P39-P41), demand has averaged 251 units, showing a slight softening from the October plateau (~293). However, Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with the week of Black Friday, a major retail event. Given the product's category (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), it is highly susceptible to promotional spikes. Historical peaks for this SKU, such as P33 (612 units) and P30 (357 units), indicate that demand can more than double during high-interest periods. Consequently, I am forecasting a significant seasonal spike for the holiday promotion week, projecting an increase of approximately 80% over the recent 250-unit baseline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has shown a significant upward trend during the autumn/winter season, settling into a high-usage plateau (~285-300 units). Period 38 (385) and Period 42 (733) represent massive spikes. Period 42's spike to 733 units coincides with the 'Black Friday' retail week (late November), representing a 150-200% increase over the baseline plateau. Historical data shows that following extreme promotional peaks (like the late September peak of 612), demand typically undergoes a significant immediate correction as the artificial surge subsides. Comparing the Period 33 spike (612 units) to its successor P34 (313 units), demand dropped by approximately 49%. Applying a similar correction logic to the Black Friday spike, Period 43 is expected to return to the established seasonal regime seen in periods 39-41 (avg ~251 units) plus some residual tail-end shopping benefit.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Promotional spike confirmed: Period 42 (Black Friday week) showed a ~150% increase over the autumn plateau (733 vs ~293 average), followed by an expected correction to baseline levels in early December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant spike in Period 42 (733 units) due to Black Friday, followed by a sharp 'post-promotional hangover' in Period 43 (169 units), which fell below the autumn plateau of ~293. For Period 44 (Dec 9), demand is expected to recover from this temporary lull as holiday party season and secondary gift-shopping peaks occur. Analysis of pre-Black Friday performance (Periods 39-41) suggests a baseline average of approximately 251 units. I expect Period 44 to return to this seasonal range, specifically trending towards the midpoint between the post-peak dip and the previous autumn stable average.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong autumn/winter baseline for this blazer, typically averaging between 260 and 310 units (excluding outliers). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike (733), followed by a Period 43 correction (169). Period 44 (304) indicates a return to the established high-demand regime as consumers engage in holiday shopping. Period 45 (Dec 16) represents the final peak week for holiday gifting and 'party season' attire before shipping deadlines and the Christmas holiday. Given that P44 returned to the 300-unit level, I expect Period 45 to maintain similar strength or see a slight seasonal lift before the anticipated year-end slowdown.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand autumn/winter plateau for this blazer, averaging ~293 units (P34-P41, excluding the Black Friday outlier). The most recent demand (P44: 304, P45: 258) suggests a slight softening as we enter late December. The current period (P46) falls on Dec 23rd, the peak of the Christmas holiday week. For the tailoring category (professional/dressed wear), this typically results in a significant drop-off as businesses close and consumer focus shifts to festive leisure/party wear or casual attire rather than structured work blazers. Compared to the mid-December average of ~281, a seasonal contraction of 20-30% is expected during the Christmas week closure.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand in Period 46 (Christmas week) saw a significant seasonal drop to 128 units, consistent with reduced retail activity for tailoring during the holiday. Period 47 (Dec 30) marks the transition from the holiday lull into the January sales period and the beginning of the 'New Year/Back-to-Work' cycle. Historically, this product maintained an autumn/winter baseline of approximately 280-300 units (P44-P45 avg: 281). While a full recovery to the 300+ level is expected mid-January, Period 47 should show a strong partial recovery as post-Christmas clearance sales begin and consumer interest in professional attire resumes.
