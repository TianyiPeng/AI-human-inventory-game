Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 with no historical observation data besides the 5 initial demand samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is women's tailored apparel. The current date is Feb 11, 2019, suggesting we are entering the spring season, typically a period of stable or slightly increasing demand for business-casual attire. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given we have no evidence of lead time deviation or demand regime shifts yet, I will use all available demand samples (N=5) to establish the baseline. The OR engine will use these to calculate the base stock to cover demand for L+1 (3) periods. The service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a Women's Blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). History shows demand for the first period was 227 units, with past demand samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. The mean of these 6 samples is 182.3. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 207 units in transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2, these units are expected to arrive in Period 3. Since we have no concluded lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend in demand (last 3 periods were 179, 196, 186, followed by the actual Period 1 demand of 227), which helps the OR backend adjust to the current demand regime. The blazer is a 'Dressed' item, and February often sees a transition toward spring professional wear, explaining the recent demand increase.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. This product (Mariette Blazer) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at historical demand: [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] prior to the start, followed by observed demands of 227 (P1) and 284 (P2). There is a clear upward trend in demand. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (207 units) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible at the start of P4. The total in-transit is 443 (207 from P1 + 236 from P2). Because demand has increased significantly in the last two periods (avg ~255) compared to the initial history (avg ~173), I am using recent_N=5 to capture the recent growth while maintaining a stable baseline. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock covers the higher demand regime and protects against stockouts during the lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer), and the date is early March. Historical demand data shows [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] followed by observed demand in P1-P3 of [227, 284, 198]. The mean demand has shifted upwards from the pre-game history (~173) to the current active periods (~236). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (207 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and will be visible at the start of Period 4 (this period), but since the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', we must wait for the P4 conclude message to verify arrival. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 706, which covers the orders from P1, P2, and P3 (207+236+263=706). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent higher demand level while waiting for the lead time to be confirmed. The lead time L is kept at 'default' (2) as it is too early to conclude a deviation from the promised time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a piece of women's tailoring/dressed apparel. We are in early March (Period 5). Demand history shows [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] prior to the simulation start, and observed demand in Periods 1-4 was [227, 284, 198, 214]. There is a noticeable upward shift in demand compared to the initial historical samples, likely due to the start of the spring professional/fashion season. Regarding lead times: the promised lead time (L) is 2. However, the order placed in Period 3 arrived in Period 4, indicating a lead time of 1 period for that specific shipment. No arrivals have yet been recorded for the orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 (207 and 236 units respectively), which are now overdue if L=1 or L=2. This suggests either variability in lead times or potential losses. Given the 'In-transit' total is 510 (which matches Period 1 order 207 + Period 2 order 236 + Period 4 order 67), we are still waiting for early shipments to clear the stockout. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand regime observed in the simulation and stick to the default L=2 for safety, as the single L=1 observation is not yet a sustained pattern.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in its peak spring season (mid-March). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [227, 284, 198, 214, 215] shows a mean of 227.6 units/period. The actual lead time observed in Period 4 and Period 5 was 1 period (orders placed in P3 arrived in P4; P4 arrived in P5), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, orders from P1 and P2 have not yet concluded, creating a significant stockout gap (current on-hand is 0). To mitigate this and capture the spring demand, I am setting L to 1 (based on recent observations) and using recent_N for demand parameters. I chose N=5 to encompass the full observation history since the start of February, which reflects the current 'Dressed/Womens Tailoring' season.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period for recent deliveries (P4, P5), though early orders (P1, P2) remain unrecorded in the 'conclude' logs, suggesting potential shipment loss or significant delay for those specific batches.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation confirms a persistent demand regime shift since Period 2. The initial five historical data points (avg 173) are no longer representative of the current phase (Periods 1-6 avg demand: 225.5). Specifically, the last three periods (P4-P6) show stable demand at approx 215 units. I will set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2, but the last three successful deliveries (Orders from P3, P4, P5) all arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This indicates a consistent acceleration compared to the promised 2. Orders from P1 and P2 appear lost or significantly delayed as they have not 'concluded' after 5+ periods. I will use L=1 (via 'recent_N') to align with the actual observed lead time of the most recent successful shipments. This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L) reflects the actual replenishment cycle, avoiding excessive over-ordering while maintaining availability for the current 215-unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed as 1 period (P4-P6 arrivals); Demand stabilized at avg ~215 since P4 (+24% vs history); Orders from P1 and P2 confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is a Women's Blazer. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting around Period 1, with recent demand (P4-P7) averaging approximately 207.5 units, significantly higher than the pre-game history. The promised lead time is 2, but 'conclude' messages for Periods 4, 5, and 6 consistently show an actual lead time of 1 period. However, Period 7 saw 0 arrivals despite an order-placing gap (ordered=0 in P6 and P7), and orders from P1/P2 are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 443 units. Since we expect a lead time of 1 (based on recent successful arrivals), we use L=1. We set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current demand level (~207 units/period), which for (1+L=2) periods equals roughly 415. The in-transit inventory (443) currently covers the base stock requirement, but we must maintain these parameters to ensure the OR backend keeps the pipeline full as demand continues.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a Women's Blazer. Current date is April 8th (Spring/Pre-Easter), which is peak season for tailoring and smart-casual wear. Historical data (P1-P8) shows a demand regime change starting around P1; the average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 222 units (Std Dev ~31), compared to the pre-game history of ~173. Recent demand (P8) spiked to 249. Lead time analysis: Orders from P3, P4, and P5 all arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period. Orders from P1 and P2 (443 units total) are definitively lost as they are now 6-7 periods overdue against a promised 2 and actual 1. These 443 units in 'In-transit' are phantom inventory. To compensate, I set L=1 based on observed performance and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the stable P4-P8 period) to reflect the current high-demand spring regime. This ensures the OR backend places orders despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~173 to ~222 (+28%) starting Period 1, likely due to spring seasonality for tailoring.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a peak spring seasonality period (mid-April). Demand history shows a shift from an early baseline of ~173 to a higher regime averaging ~218 over the last 9 periods. Recent demand (P7-P9) has fluctuated (186, 249, 178) with an average of 204. I am maintaining L=1 despite the promised L=2, as orders from P3, P4, and P5 all arrived with lead_time=1. Orders from P1 and P2 are confirmed lost. No arrivals occurred in P7-P9 because no orders were placed in P6-P8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. An order of 16 was placed in P9 and is expected to arrive during P10 (at lead_time=1). To capture the spring tailoring demand and recover from the stockout, I will set mu_hat using the recent regime of 9 periods (P1-P9) and set L to 1 to reflect the observed delivery speed.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing a severe stockout situation. Current date is April 22nd, representing the peak of spring/summer tailoring season. Historical lead times for successful arrivals (P4, P5, P6) were 1 period, whereas orders from P1, P2, P9, and P10 have not arrived, suggesting a high variance in supply chain reliability or lost shipments. Total in-transit inventory is 476 units, but none have arrived in the last 4 periods (P7-P10). Demand has averaged 210 units over the last 10 periods, with a recent slight dip (P10: 130). Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 0.8. Since the 'promised' lead time is 2 but observed lead time is often 1 (when it works) or infinite (when lost), I will set L to 1 to encourage the OR backend to order based on the most recent successful lead time, while using an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the current demand regime and higher volatility due to stockouts and supply uncertainty. I will use a mu_hat based on (1+L)*210 = 420 to ensure we attempt to cover two periods of demand (current + arrival).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Orders from P1, P2, P9, and P10 (totaling 476 units) are significantly delayed or potentially lost, as arrivals for P4-P6 followed a 1-period lead time. Demand remains stable around 210 units despite recent stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (April 29), we are managing the 'Mariette Blazer', which typically sees spring seasonality. Historical demand has shifted: the initial periods (P1-P8) averaged ~221, but recent demand (P9-P11) has dropped to an average of ~145. This decline might be due to stockouts impacting customer behavior or a shift in the local seasonal cycle. Lead time remains erratic: while P4-P6 showed a lead_time of 1, the most recent arrival (P11) took 2 periods. Orders from P1, P2, and P10 (totaling 460 units) are currently in-transit but largely suspect/delayed. On-hand inventory is 0. To stabilize the OR backend, I will use a recent_N window for demand (N=3) to capture the lower current demand levels and set L explicitly to 2 periods to account for the most recent observed lead time and hedge against supply instability. This will prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for the spring tail-end.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~221 to ~145 (-34%), potentially due to prolonged stockouts or late-spring seasonal tapering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) is currently facing significant supply chain instability and stockouts. Observations: 1) Supply Chain: Orders from P1, P2, and P10 (totaling 460 units) are late or lost, while orders from P3-P5 arrived with a 1-period lead time and P9 arrived with a 2-period lead time. This inconsistency makes the promised lead time of 2 unreliable. 2) Demand: Demand remains active (191 in P12), but has shown higher volatility recently. Average demand since Period 9 (seasonal tapering/stockout effect) is approx 156. 3) Parameters: I will use an explicit L=2 to match the promised lead time, as the 1-period arrivals were likely an anomaly and the most recent arrival (P9) took 2 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand trend observed over the last month (Avg: 156.5), as the earlier high-demand regime (Avg: 220+) has faded with the end of the peak spring tailoring season (early May). Sigma_hat will use the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~221 to ~156 (-29%) coincident with the late-spring season. Lead time is highly inconsistent; while some arrived in 1 period, the most recent successful delivery (P9) adhered to the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) is currently experiencing severe supply chain instability. On-hand inventory is 0, and despite 501 units in-transit, recent orders have arrived in fragmented batches with inconsistent lead times (1-2 periods) or have been lost entirely (P1, P2, P10). Demand has shifted from a high-spring average of ~220 to a late-spring average of ~159 (P9-P13). With current date May 13th, we are moving past the peak tailoring season. For Period 14, I am setting L=2 (promised) to account for the most recent successful 2-period arrival (P11) and the unreliability of 1-period arrivals. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 159 using recent_N=5 to capture the post-peak demand regime. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to reflect the current demand volatility. The OR backend will likely order a larger quantity due to the 'pipeline inventory' (501 units) vs. 'base stock' comparison, but the cap should prevent over-ordering if it perceives the in-transit units as viable stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: arrivals fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P11 took 2, P13 took 1). Order from Period 10 is likely lost or significantly delayed as P12 has already arrived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand regime from Period 1 to Period 8 (avg ~221) and a lower-demand regime starting Period 9 (avg ~164), likely reflecting the end of the peak spring tailoring season for this blazer. In-transit inventory is high (514 units), consisting of orders from P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (17), P13 (41), and P14 (13). Orders from P1 and P2 (443 units) are over 10 periods late and must be considered lost; including them in 'pipeline inventory' would prevent the OR backend from ordering necessary stock. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P12 arrived in 1, P11 arrived in 2, P9 arrived in 2). To handle the lost shipments, I will use 'explicit' L=2 to ensure a 3-period coverage (L+1). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime (P9-P14 avg: 163.7). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to reflect current volatility. This approach signals to the OR engine that the massive P1/P2 pipeline is phantom, allowing it to place orders based on real needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~221 to ~164 (-26%) as the spring peak season for blazers concludes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing the Mariette Blazer, a seasonal women's tailoring item. Demand analysis shows a shift starting around Period 9, where average demand dropped from ~221 to ~164 units as the spring peak season tapered off. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 163.3 units. The supply chain has been highly unstable: orders from P1, P2, P10, and P14 appear lost or severely delayed. Since P11, we have observed lead times of 2 periods (P11 arrival), 1 period (P13 arrival), and currently, P14 and P15 have not arrived. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods to be conservative given recent volatility. mu_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the post-peak demand regime (avg ~160) across 3 periods (L+1). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. With 535 units in transit (mostly consisting of potentially lost older orders), the OR backend will attempt to order up to the base stock, but the capped policy and pipeline accounting are critical here to avoid over-ordering while trying to break the stockout cycle.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing significant stockouts and supply chain instability. Historical demand shows a peak during spring (Feb-Apr) with averages around 220, tapering off in May-June to approximately 160-170 (P13-P16 avg: 166.7). The current date (June 3) suggests we are exiting the peak season. In-transit inventory is high (535 units), but many of these are likely lost (specifically P1, P2, and P10, totaling 460 units). The actual lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P9 and P11 took 2, while P13 took 1). To prevent over-ordering due to 'phantom' in-transit stock that will never arrive, I will use an explicit L=2 to match the promised lead time and recent observations. Demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=4 to capture the post-peak tapering (approx 165 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of ~495 (3 periods * 165), which will be compared against the 535 units in-transit by the OR engine. Since the backend caps the order based on in-transit stock, it may order zero if it believes the 535 units are coming, which is appropriate given the risk of high holding costs for a seasonal item entering summer.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand tapering confirmed: June demand for women's tailoring (blazers) dropped to ~165 from spring peak of ~220. Supply chain remains unreliable with suspected losses of orders from P1, P2, and P10 totaling 460 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10th (Period 18). Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal peak during spring (avg ~220) and a tapering effect as summer approaches (avg ~165 since Period 9). Demand in the most recent period was 118, confirming this downward trend. The supply chain has been unreliable: orders from P1, P2, and P10 (totaling 460 units) are considered lost as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. Recent arrivals (P15) followed a 2-period lead time, while others (P12) arrived in 1 period. To manage the high stockout risk caused by lost shipments while acknowledging the seasonal decline, I am setting L=2 (promised/recent max). mu_hat is set using recent_N=9 to capture the post-peak demand regime (averaging ~160/period) while ignoring the earlier high-spring spikes. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17th, 2019. This SKU (Mariette Blazer) has finished its spring peak (avg ~220) and entered a summer trough. Demand over the last five periods (P14-P18) has averaged approximately 153 units, significantly lower than the early spring peak. Supply chain volatility remains the primary challenge: the promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, with several orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, and P14 (totaling 514 units) apparently lost or severely delayed. Since these 514 units are still in 'In-transit', the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent new orders. To counteract the impact of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that will likely never arrive, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~153) and use an 'explicit' L of 2 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the promised lead time, providing a safety buffer for the next replenishment cycle once the pipeline clears or is reconciled.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Average demand decreased to ~153 (-31%) compared to the spring peak, reflecting summer seasonality for blazers. Pipeline inventory (514 units) contains significant volumes from P1, P2, P10, P13, and P14 that are over 4 periods old and likely lost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (June 24), the pipeline inventory of 514 units is entirely composed of orders from Periods 1, 2, 10, 13, and 14, which are all significantly past their expected arrival dates and are confirmed as lost. Since the OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from the base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 514 lost units. Demand has transitioned into a summer trough, with the last 5 periods (P15-P19) averaging ~138 units, down from the spring peak of ~220. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 514 units of bad data in the pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: ((L+1) * forecasted_demand) + suspected_lost_units. With L=2 and forecast=140, target = (3 * 140) + 514 = 934. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 514 units is confirmed as lost (Orders P1, P2, P10, P13, P14); Summer demand trough for blazers confirmed with mean ~138 units (Period 15-19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (July 1st), which is mid-summer for the 'Mariette Blazer'. Historical data shows a clear demand decline from the spring peak (~220 units) to a summer trough (~138 units in Periods 15-19, and only 73 units in Period 20). The pipeline inventory of 875 units is heavily distorted by 514 units from older orders (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) that have not arrived and are considered lost. The OR backend needs to know that the 'true' pipeline is much smaller to place necessary replenishment. For L, I will use 'default' (2 periods) as recent successful arrivals (P9, P12, P15) fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, making the promised lead time a safe conservative anchor. For mu_hat, I choose 'recent_N' with N=6 (Periods 15-20) to capture the current summer demand regime (avg ~127 units), allowing the OR engine to adjust for the seasonal slowdown while accounting for the recent low demand of 73 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect current volatility during this trough.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for blazers deepened in late June: Period 20 demand dropped to 73 units, significantly below the P15-P19 average of 138.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we are managing the 'Mariette Blazer', a product experiencing a seasonal summer trough. Demand has decreased from a spring average of ~220 to a summer average of ~138, with more recent volatility (73 in P20, 116 in P21). The 'In-transit' figure of 875 units is deceptive: carry-over insights and historical logs confirm that orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, and P14 (totaling 514 units) are effectively lost. This leaves an active pipeline of 361 units (ordered in P20). Actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Since P20 was ordered with a promised lead time of 2, it is expected to arrive during the current Period 22 and be visible in Period 23's start. To address the supply chain unreliability and the confirmed seasonal demand drop, I am setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'm using a recent_N of 7 (covering Period 15-21) to capture the summer regime average (~131 units) while providing enough safety margin for the recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to reconcile the active pipeline against the forecasted demand, potentially triggering a small replenishment if the backend considers the active 361 units insufficient for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for blazers continues into July; 5-period average (P17-P21) is approximately 114 units, showing a further decline from the initial summer estimate of 138.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a summer demand trough (July), with recent demand (P17-P22) averaging approximately 115 units. This is a significant decrease from the spring peak of ~220 units. The pipeline inventory (875 units) includes 514 units confirmed as lost (orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, P14), leaving 361 active units ordered in Period 20. With a promised lead time of 2 periods and observed arrivals often taking 2, the P20 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 22 or 23. Therefore, I will see its arrival confirmed at the start of Period 23 or 24. Since on-hand is currently 0 and pipeline (adjusted for losses) is 361, which covers roughly 3 periods of summer demand (361 / 115 \u2248 3.1), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover the lead time + review period. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (covering the summer trough starting P17) and default lead time settings. This allows the OR backend to reconcile the pipeline against the target base stock, likely resulting in a zero or small order to avoid overstocking during this low-demand season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (2019/7/22), which is the summer trough for women's blazers. Demand has stabilized around a lower mean following the spring peak. The 5-period average (P19-P23) is approximately 110 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 514 units is confirmed to be lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14), as established in Carry-over Insights. These 514 units will never arrive, but the OR backend counts them in the pipeline, preventing new orders. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value to force an order, or adjust the lead time. However, the current on-hand inventory is 241 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of the current summer demand (~110-120 units). Given the recent arrival from P20 took 3 periods (lead_time=3), I will set L to 3 to reflect recent supply chain slowdowns. Since we have sufficient on-hand stock for the immediate future and a massive (albeit phantom) pipeline, the OR engine will likely not order more. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the summer demand level of ~110 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time increased to 3 periods (P20 order arrived P23). Summer demand for blazers continues to track at a lower mean of ~110 units (P19-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a summer demand trough (late July). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is approximately 98.4 units, significantly lower than the spring peak (~220) and the early summer estimate (~138). Specifically, the last two periods saw demands of 120 and 63. Regarding lead time, the most recent arrival (P23) from an order in P20 confirms an actual lead time of 3 periods, which is longer than the promised 2. The pipeline inventory (514 units) consists of orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, and P14, all of which are excessively overdue and confirmed as lost in previous carry-over insights. With on-hand inventory at 178 units and expected weekly demand around 100 units, current stock covers nearly 2 periods. Given the 3-period lead time and the risk of holding costs during this low-demand season, I will set L to 3 and use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current trough of ~100 units/period, while maintaining a recent_N of 5 for sigma to account for the recent volatility (73 to 120 range).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for blazers further softened in July: 5-period average (P20-P24) is ~98 units, down from June's ~138.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The product is a women's blazer, which is currently in a summer demand trough. Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 82.6 units (116, 120, 120, 63, 94), showing a significant decline from the spring peak and earlier summer estimates. The pipeline inventory (514 units) consists of orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, and P14, which are now confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed and should be ignored for replenishment logic. The most recent successful delivery (P20) arrived in 3 periods (Period 23), indicating an increase from the promised 2-period lead time. With 84 units on hand and demand trending lower, the current inventory covers approximately one period. To account for the observed lead time of 3 periods and the current demand regime, I am setting L to 3. Mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer demand level (~83 units/period), and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering during the seasonal trough while adjusting for the lengthened lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for blazers further confirmed: Period 21-25 average demand dropped to ~83 units/period, down from the previous June/July estimate of ~110.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019/8/12), transitioning from the summer trough toward the potential fall demand increase for women's tailoring (blazers). The recent demand history shows a summer average of approximately 83 units (P21-P25), but Period 26 saw a significant jump to 146 units, suggesting the start of a late-summer/pre-fall recovery. The pipeline inventory (514 units) is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) as documented in carry-over insights; therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero following the stockout in P26. We need to re-establish inventory. While the promised lead time is 2, recent deliveries showed 3 periods (P23 arrival). I will set L to 3 to be safe. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 6 periods (P21-P26) to capture the summer baseline while incorporating the recent uptick (average ~102/period). This provides a base_stock target covering 4 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled: Period 26 demand (146) is 75% higher than the P21-P25 summer average (83), indicating the end of the summer trough for blazers.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are moving out of the summer trough for women's blazers (SKU 568601006) and entering the late August/early September peak associated with the back-to-work and fall season. Demand in Period 26 (146) and Period 27 (301) shows a sharp upward trajectory compared to the summer average of ~83. The pipeline inventory (514 units) is confirmed as lost (Orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, P14), leaving effective on-hand and pipeline at 0. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods. I will use L=3 to be conservative given past supply instability. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to forecast for the fall recovery, targeting 220 units per period (the previous spring peak level) across the (L+1) window, totaling 880 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent high volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand recovery confirmed: Period 27 demand spiked to 301, signaling the end of the summer trough and the start of the autumn peak for blazers.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the fall recovery/peak for women's blazers as of late August (Period 29). Demand has spiked significantly from a summer average of ~83 to 301 (P27) and 251 (P28), confirming a seasonal shift. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this new high-demand regime (avg ~232 per period). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for recent variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). The in-transit inventory is 887, but a large portion (514 units) from early periods is confirmed lost; the backend's capped policy should handle the active pipeline (P28 order of 373) while my parameters focus on the current demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand recovery for blazers confirmed at Period 27: demand increased from summer trough of ~83 to an average of ~276 (P27-P28), marking the start of the autumn peak season.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has clearly transitioned from its summer trough (~83 units/period) into an autumn peak season. Evidence from Period 27 (301), Period 28 (251), and Period 29 (231) confirms a new sustained demand regime with an average of approximately 261 units per period. The recent arrival from the Period 28 order showed a lead time of 1 period, although history shows volatility (1 to 3 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history while acknowledging the promised 2 periods. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new autumn regime (P27-P29). For volatility (sigma_hat), N=3 is also used to reflect the variance within this high-demand period. The carry-over insights confirm that the 514 units currently 'in-transit' are from old, lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14), so the OR backend must account for these as dead inventory to trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime confirmed (P27-P29): mean demand shifted from ~83 to ~261 (+214%) for the Mariette Blazer.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has clearly transitioned from its summer trough (avg ~83) into a high-demand autumn peak. The demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) has been 301, 251, 231, and 357, resulting in a new mean of approximately 285. In Period 30, the on-hand inventory was completely depleted by a demand of 357, leaving 0 units available. The 'In-transit' quantity of 514 is confirmed as lost (orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, P14), meaning the pipeline is effectively empty. Lead times have been highly volatile (recent observations: 3, 1, and 1 period). Given the urgent need to restock for the autumn peak and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR backend covers enough demand (L+1 = 3 periods). I will use the recent 4-period demand window (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the 285 mean and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen during this seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak for Mariette Blazer confirmed (P27-P30): mean demand shifted to ~285 (+243% from summer trough).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season (Period 32, mid-September). Analysis of demand from Period 27 to Period 31 shows a significant regime shift, with demand averaging approximately 293.6 units per period, a stark contrast to the summer trough of ~83 units. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; the most recent completed cycle (P28 order arriving P29) was 1 period, but earlier cycles showed 3 periods (P20). Given the high demand and current zero on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this autumn peak. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average, which helps buffer against the observed supply chain inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak for Mariette Blazer firmly established (P27-P31): mean demand is ~294 units (+254% vs summer trough). Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its autumn peak season (Mariette Blazer). Demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has averaged 342 units, significantly higher than previous periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 514 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, and P14, which are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as per carry-over insights. However, the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock calculation. To force an order that satisfies actual demand despite this phantom inventory, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to 1540. This value accounts for (L+1) periods of demand at the current rate (3 * 342 = 1026) plus the 514 units of phantom inventory that the backend will erroneously subtract. Sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of the recent peak (approx 60) scaled by sqrt(L+1), adjusted slightly higher to ensure the cap does not truncate the necessary recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak for Mariette Blazer confirmed (P27-P32): mean demand is ~302 units; most recent 3-period average is ~342 units. Pipeline inventory (514 units) remains lost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn demand season for the Mariette Blazer (confirmed by P27-P33 data). The average demand over the last 7 periods (since the recovery in P27) is approximately 303 units, with the most recent period reaching 612 units, suggesting a significant spike as we enter October. The pipeline inventory is currently 1132 units, but 514 units are confirmed lost from much earlier periods. This leaves an active pipeline of 618 units (ordered in P33). Lead times have been volatile, appearing as 1 period in P29 and P32, but historical delays up to 3 periods have occurred. To ensure coverage for the current peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (the start of the autumn regime) and lead time L to the promised 2 periods to maintain a conservative buffer against recent volatility. The target inventory must cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, approximately 900-1000 units. Since 618 are in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap to the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 33 demand spiked to 612 units, significantly above the previous regime average of ~302. Active pipeline is 618 units (P33 order), as 514 units from early periods remain lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $947.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 conclude shows demand moderated to 313 after the Period 33 spike of 612. The Autumn peak regime (P27-P34) currently averages ~342 units per period. The shipment from Period 33 arrived in 1 period, maintaining the recent volatile lead time pattern (1 to 3 periods). For Period 35, on-hand inventory is 305 units and pipeline inventory is 604 units (consisting of the 90 units from P34 and the 514 units long-considered lost from early periods). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 514 lost units, I will keep mu_hat elevated. I am setting L to explicit 2 (promised) as lead times are fluctuating. Mu_hat is set to explicit 1026, calculated as (1+L) * 342 (the average of the current Autumn regime) to ensure sufficient base stock is maintained despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 514 units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the high volatility of the Autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: P33 demand spike (612) followed by P34 moderation (313); regime average (P27-P34) is ~342 units. Pipeline still contains 514 units of 'ghost' inventory from early periods (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) that are confirmed lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season (Period 27 onwards). Recent demand (P27-P35) has averaged ~335 units per period, despite a single outlier spike of 612 in P33. The most recent demand (P35) was 283 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 893 units. However, 514 of these units are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory from early periods (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) that will likely never arrive. The active pipeline consists of the P34 order (90 units) and the P35 order (289 units), totaling 379 units. Since the lead time has recently stabilized at 1 period (P28, P31, P33, P34 all arrived in 1 period), I will use L=1. To capture the current autumn demand level while smoothing the P33 outlier, I will use mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (N=9, starting P27) to reflect the peak season regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to account for the high volatility seen during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime (P27-P35) average demand is ~335 units. Lead time has stabilized at 1 period for the last four successful deliveries.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season (late October). Analysis of demand from Period 27 onwards shows a significant regime shift, with a mean demand of approximately 335 units. The most recent demand (P36) was 282, slightly lower than the regime average but consistent with sustained high volume. The lead time for the last four successful deliveries (P28, P31, P33, P35) has been 1 period, suggesting recent logistics stability. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 893 units is problematic. It includes 514 units from early periods (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) that are confirmed lost. The active pipeline consists of orders from P34 (90 units) and P35 (289 units). Based on a 1-period lead time, the P34 order was expected in P35 (it did not arrive) and the P35 order was expected in P36 (it did not arrive). This indicates a shift back to a 2-period lead time or a slight delay. I will use L=2 (promised) to be safe. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the autumn regime (P27-P36). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to account for the high volatility seen during this peak (including the 612 demand spike in P33).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain volatility remains: 514 units (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost. Recent lead times fluctuated from 1 period back toward 2 periods as orders from P34 and P35 did not arrive by P36.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season (late October). Demand from Period 27 to Period 37 has averaged approximately 320 units per period. While there was a significant spike of 612 units in Period 33, recent demand has stabilized around 280-310 units. However, supply chain volatility has returned: while lead times were briefly 1 period, the order from Period 34 took 3 periods to arrive (arriving in Period 37), and the order from Period 35 (289 units) is now overdue (currently Period 38, placed P35, promised 2 periods). I am adjusting the lead time parameter L to 3 to account for this recent slowdown and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=11 to capture the entire autumn regime (P27-P37) which averages ~320 units/period, providing a robust forecast for the remaining peak. This combination of higher L and current demand levels will signal the OR backend to increase the order to compensate for both the increased lead time and the potential loss of the P35 shipment, while still being protected by the backend's 'cap' logic.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility increased: P34 order took 3 periods (arrived P37), and P35 order is overdue as of P38. Autumn peak demand (P27-P37) is stable at an average of ~320 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn season for the Mariette Blazer (Period 39: Nov 4). Demand remains robust, with an average of approximately 320 units per period over the last 12 weeks (P27-P38). The most recent demand (P38) was 385 units. Supply chain volatility is the primary concern: 514 units are confirmed lost, and recent lead times have shifted from 1 period to 3 periods (P34 arrived in P37). The P35 order (289 units) is now overdue (3 periods), and the P37/P38 orders (252 and 429 units respectively) are still in transit. Total 'active' pipeline is 970 units (289 + 252 + 429), while the 514 units from early periods are ignored as 'ghost' inventory. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the 320-unit demand regime for (L+1)=3 periods to ensure the backend target covers the current trend and accounts for the high variability in lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility increased: recent successful delivery (P34) took 3 periods, while others took 1. Autumn demand regime (P27-P38) is stable at ~320 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019/11/11. The product is the Mariette Blazer, currently in its autumn peak season. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been stable but high, with an average of ~304 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) and ~319 units since the autumn recovery began (P27). The most recent demand (P39) was 231 units, showing a slight softening but remaining within the high-demand regime. Supply Chain: Lead time remains volatile, with recent arrivals taking 1, 3, and 2 periods respectively. Pipeline inventory is currently 1232 units, but 514 units of this (from P1, P2, P10, P13, P14) are confirmed lost and must be discounted. The active pipeline consists of P35 (289 units, overdue), P38 (429 units), and P40 (this decision). I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full autumn regime starting from Period 27, and calculate for L to account for the lead time variance (1 to 3 periods). Parameters are set to ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock that covers the volatile lead time while avoiding excessive holding costs if the 514 'ghost' units were erroneously counted by the OR backend (though the backend capped policy usually mitigates this).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak regime (P27-P39) demand remains stable at an average of ~319 units/period. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with P35 (289 units) now officially overdue at L=5.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season (P27-P40), with demand averaging approximately 316 units per period. The supply chain remains volatile: lead times have recently fluctuated between 1, 2, and 3 periods (P34 took 3, P37 took 2, P33 took 1). Specifically, the order from Period 35 (289 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost, following the pattern of earlier lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14). The order from Period 38 (429 units) is currently at L=2 and should arrive shortly. Given the consistent autumn demand and the presence of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (the 514 units from early periods plus the likely lost P35 order), I am using an explicit lead time of 2 periods to match the promised lead time while accounting for the recent instability. Mu_hat is set using the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the stable autumn regime (avg ~316), and sigma_hat is set over the same window to capture the observed variance in this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order from Period 35 (289 units) is confirmed as lost/indefinitely delayed (L=5 with no arrival); Autumn peak demand remains stable at ~316 units/period (P27-P40). Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory is now 803 units (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), we are in the stable Autumn demand regime for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (P38-P41) has averaged ~285 units. However, the system reports 803 units 'In-transit', all of which are confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, and P35). Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is significantly inflated to account for this 'ghost' inventory. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the (L+1) period demand despite the 803 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3nd-period lead time (observed L fluctuates between 1 and 3, using 3 for safety) as (L+1)*mean = 4 * 285 = 1140. To force an order when the backend sees (184 on-hand + 803 ghost pipeline = 987 total), I set mu_hat to a value that reflects the actual demand plus the lost volume. I set L=3 based on the most recent delivery (P38 order arrived in P41). I use sigma_hat recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 803 units (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Autumn peak demand (P27-P41) remains stable at ~300 units/period, but late-November demand shows a slight tapering to ~285 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $736.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer spiked significantly in Period 42 to 733 units, likely driven by Cyber Monday/Black Friday retail events. This follows a period of relatively stable autumn demand (~300 units/period). Historically, December demand for women's tailoring can be volatile, but given the massive stockout in P42 (733 demand vs 184 sold), it is crucial to replenish. The current in-transit inventory is 1140 units, but this includes 803 units confirmed lost (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35). The only 'active' pipeline is the P42 order of 337 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L=3 to be safe given recent arrivals (P38 arrived in 3 periods). For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 350 units per period to account for the post-spike stabilization and potential holiday sales, while sigma_hat will be set high to account for the recent demand surge variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 42 (733 units) confirmed as a significant outlier/seasonal peak related to late November sales events; Autumn/Winter baseline remains approximately 300-350 units. Pipeline correction: 803 units (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) are confirmed lost and do not contribute to available stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/9 (Period 44). The demand spiked in Period 42 (733 units) likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales but corrected significantly in Period 43 (169 units). The autumn/winter baseline for this Mariette Blazer is established at ~300 units, but we are entering the mid-December period where demand for dressy blazers typically remains steady before a post-holiday dip. The pipeline inventory is currently 1779 units; however, 803 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) and must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations. The remaining 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P42 (337) and P43 (639), totaling 976 units. Lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) to be safe. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the autumn regime while smoothing the massive P42 outlier. sigma_hat is set to explicit to reflect high seasonal volatility without over-penalizing for the single P42 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Real pipeline inventory is 976 units (P42, P43). Previous 'ghost' inventory totaling 803 units (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) is confirmed lost and should be ignored for all future planning.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized following the late-November spike (733 units), with the most recent demand being 304 units. The 'Autumn/Winter' baseline (P27-P44) averages approximately 312 units, though recent weeks (excluding the spike) suggest a range of 250-310 units. The pipeline inventory is currently 1442 units, but 803 units of this (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) are confirmed lost and must be ignored. The 'real' pipeline consists of P43 (639 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 45 or 46 based on the volatile lead time (1-3 periods, recently 2). With 33 units on hand and 639 units in the actual pipeline, our effective inventory position is 672. Given the seasonal context of mid-December, we expect demand to remain steady or slightly taper before the holiday season ends. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (excluding the outlier from P42) to capture the current post-spike baseline, which averages ~250 units per period. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the persistent lead time volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). The 'Mariette Blazer' is transitioning from the autumn/winter peak toward post-holiday demand levels. Demand in Period 45 was 258 units, down from the massive late-November spike but consistent with the established autumn baseline (~300 units). Pipeline inventory is listed as 1442 units, but 803 units (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) are confirmed lost and must be subtracted. The 'real' pipeline is 639 units (ordered in P43). Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, the P43 order (639 units) is expected to arrive during Period 46 or 47. Since current on-hand is 0, we must ensure the real pipeline covers the next (L+1) periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the autumn/winter baseline demand (mean ~315) while smoothing the extreme P42 outlier. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). The demand for the Mariette Blazer has transitioned from the high autumn peak (~300+ units) and the late November outlier (733 units) into a year-end/winter cooling phase. Recent demands (P43-P46) are 169, 304, 258, and 128, averaging ~215 units. This reflects typical post-holiday tapering in women's tailoring. Inventory status: On-hand is 511 units following the arrival of the 639-unit order from P43. The 'In-transit' figure of 803 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P13, P14, P35) and should be treated as zero pipeline inventory by the OR engine. Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods recently (P42 took 2, P43 took 3). I will set L to 2 (promised) as it is the median of recent arrivals, and use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak demand level (~215 units/period) while avoiding the distortion of the November spike and the summer trough.

Carry-over insight: Year-end demand tapering confirmed: Demand shifted from autumn peak (~300+) to late December average of ~215 units (P43-P46). Lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods.
