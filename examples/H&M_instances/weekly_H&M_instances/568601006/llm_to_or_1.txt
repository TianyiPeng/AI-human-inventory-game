Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for the 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring item. The current date is February 11, 2019. Being in mid-February, we are likely entering the spring professional/workwear season, which typically sees steady demand. Historical demand over the last 5 periods [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows an average of 173.4 units per period with relatively moderate volatility. Promised lead time is 4. Given that we start with 0 inventory (on-hand + in-transit), we need to establish a base stock levels immediately. I will use 'default' for all parameters to leverage the full 5-period history provided, as the regime appears relatively stable. For mu_hat, the backend will calculate (1+L) * mean \u2248 (1+4) * 173.4 = 867. This level, combined with the sigma_hat buffer, will aim to satisfy demand over the (L+1) exposure period while managing the holding cost of $1.0 vs $4.0 profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 207 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. The historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (a women's garment) shows a mean of 173.4 units over the first 5 samples, but Period 1 saw a demand spike to 227 units. As this is a dressed tailoring item being sold in mid-February, we should prepare for sustained demand as the spring season approaches. The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 207 in-transit. Since we only have 6 demand samples (5 historical + Period 1), and demand appears to be trending upwards (161, 145, 179, 196, 186, and now 227), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR engine set a higher base stock to cover the total demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product (Mariette Blazer) has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, orders from Period 1 and 2 are still in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and 6 respectively. This explains the current 0 on-hand inventory and why no units have been sold yet despite demand. The demand in the last two periods (227, 284) is significantly higher than the initial provided history ([161, 145, 179, 196, 186]), suggesting a regime shift or seasonal uptick as we move into spring (late February). To capture this recent increase without being overly reactive to a tiny sample, I am using recent_N=5 (which includes the last 5 samples: 3 from historical and 2 from recent observation) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will elevate the base stock to cover the higher observed demand while waiting for the pipeline to start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~173 to ~255 (+47%) over the last two periods (P1-P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product (Mariette Blazer) is a professional women's garment, and the current date (early March) aligns with spring business-wear demand. Historical demand for the first three periods observed in-game (227, 284, 198) averages 236, which is significantly higher than the pre-game sessions (average 173). Though Period 3 saw a dip, the overall regime remains elevated. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (207 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 732 units in transit (P1: 207, P2: 239, P3: 286). Since no shipments have concluded yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the higher contemporary demand regime while acknowledging the volatility observed in the last three periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated (avg ~236) compared to pre-game data (avg ~173), consistent with seasonal transition to spring business wear.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer), and the date is early March, which is a peak period for spring business wear. Historical demands in the game (P1-P4: 227, 284, 198, 214) show a mean of 230.75, which is significantly higher (+33%) than the pre-game baseline of ~173. The on-hand inventory remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at the start of Period 6). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this higher demand regime specifically observed during the game duration. For the lead time L, I will use the 'default' method (promised L=4) as we have not yet observed any arrivals to suggest a deviation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18). The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'), fitting a seasonal transition to spring business wear. Historical demands (P1-P5) are: 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, averaging 227.6. This is significantly higher than the pre-game average of 173. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) because the P1 arrival was fully sold. However, there are 1018 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with the P2 order (239 units) expected to arrive this period (P6) and be visible in P7. Given the stable elevated demand (last 3 periods: 198, 214, 215), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this regime. L is set to 'default' (4) as the observed lead time matches the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed elevated: Period 1-5 average 227.6 units vs pre-game 173 (+31%), likely due to seasonal demand for spring blazers.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (March 25th). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees high demand in the spring (March/April). Historical demand for Periods 1-6 averages 225.5 units, significantly higher than the pre-game average of 173. Recent demand (last 4 periods) is stable at an average of 210.25 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2), both taking exactly 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (24 units), but we have 962 units in-transit. Specifically, the orders from P3 (286 units) and P4 (309 units) are expected to arrive in Period 7 and Period 8 respectively. I will use the recent demand regime (last 6 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-game data is no longer representative of the current spring season. I will stick to the default lead time calculation since the observed lead time matches the promise.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1st). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees high demand in early spring (Feb-April) for business wear. Historically, demand from P1-P7 has averaged ~219.9 units, significantly higher than the pre-game average of 173. Recent weeks (P6-P7) show a slight cooling back toward the 180-210 range. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Currently, we have 124 units on-hand and 875 in-transit (P4-P7 orders). The pipeline covers the next several periods well. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times are stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the full game history demand regime, which is more representative of the current spring season than the pre-game data alone.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (April 8th). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees strong demand during the spring business season. The demand history since Period 1 shows an average of ~223.5 units per period, which is significantly higher than the pre-game average of 173. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Currently, we have 184 units on hand and 726 units in transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The OR backend expects parameters that cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the full game history) allows the model to capture the elevated seasonal demand regime while discounting the pre-game baseline. We will maintain the 'default' lead time of 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15th. We have enough historical data from the first 9 periods to observe a clear lead-time pattern and a stable demand regime. Lead Time: All concluded orders (P1 through P5) have arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering, confirming the promised lead time of 4 is the actual lead time. Demand: The post-game mean demand is 218.4 units per period (N=9), which is significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 173. While there was an initial peak in February, demand has stabilized around the 180-250 range for the spring season. Since the last 9 periods represent the current spring business wear cycle, I will use recent_N (N=9) for demand estimation. On-hand inventory is 190, and there are 808 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Using N=9 captures the elevated spring demand pattern while smoothing out the early-period volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in Period 11 (late April). Historically, demand for this item stabilized around 210-230 units during March, but has shown a downward trend over the last two periods (178 and 130 units). The average demand since the game started (P1-P10) is 199.9 units, while the pre-game average was ~173. The recent drop from P8 (249 units) to P10 (130 units) suggests the peak spring demand may be receding as we move deeper into the season. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods for all 6 arrived shipments. Pipeline inventory is currently 781 units, with arrivals expected in P11 (199 units from P7), P12 (160 units from P8), P13 (266 units from P9), and P14 (156 units from P10). On-hand inventory is healthy at 243. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current deceleration (avg last 5 periods = 182.6) while maintaining sufficient safety stock with recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the wider volatility seen across the spring transition. L remains default as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected: Period 9-10 average (154) is 23% lower than the Period 1-8 average (211.6), suggesting a wind-down of the spring blazer peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, 2019. The 'Mariette Blazer' is transitioning out of the peak spring season. Demand has significantly decelerated over the last three periods (P9-P11: 178, 130, 127), averaging 145 units compared to the earlier peak average of ~215. On-hand inventory is high at 315 units, with a substantial pipeline of 595 units still in-transit. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P11 arrival from the P7 order). Therefore, I am choosing the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this downward trend and prevent over-ordering while holding costs would otherwise accumulate. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for N=3 to reflect the current, slightly lower volatility in the tail end of the season. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed through Period 11: 3-period average dropped to 145 units (down ~36% from peak) as spring demand for blazers winds down.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's blazer, which is transitioning out of its peak spring season. Historical data shows a clear shift: Period 1-9 average demand was ~207, while the most recent 3 periods (P10-P12) have averaged ~149 (specifically 130, 127, 191). Although there was a slight uptick to 191 in Period 12, the carry-over insight confirms a sustained deceleration as we enter May. Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods (P1-P8 orders arriving exactly at L=4). Currently, on-hand (284) plus in-transit (435) totals 719 units. Given the desired base stock covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), at our recent average of 149 units/period, we would target ~745 units. Since we have 719 in the system and inventory is high after the seasonal peak, I will maintain the most recent 'recent_N' parameters (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order against declining seasonality. 'L' remains at default as promised lead time is accurate.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13, 2019), we are observing the tail end of the spring blazer season. The carry-over insights correctly identified a demand deceleration starting around Period 11. Recent demands (P9-P13) are 178, 130, 127, 191, and 160, averaging 157.2. Despite a slight bump in P12, the trend is generally lower than the March/April peak which averaged >200. With 390 units on-hand and 265 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13), we are currently overstocked relative to the slowing demand. The order from P10 (156 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P14). Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining the stable lead time estimate of 4 periods. This will steer the OR backend towards smaller or zero orders until the excess inventory is digested.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level (~157 units) from Period 9-13, confirming the post-peak deceleration noted in Period 12.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase. After a high-demand period in early spring, demand stabilized at a lower average of 157 units (Periods 9-13). However, the most recent demand (Period 14) spiked back to 196 units. Despite this spike, historical evidence from the Carry-Over Insights suggests a general downward trend as we approach the end of the spring season. The inventory position is currently quite high: 350 units on-hand and 294 in-transit (orders from P11, P13, and P14), totaling 644 units of pipeline inventory. Given that the promised lead time (L=4) has been consistently met in every single period (P1-P10 arrivals all arrived at L=4), I will maintain L=4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to encompass the stabilized demand period (P9-P14), which yields a mean of ~164 units per period. This balances the recent spike with the overall deceleration trend. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 6 periods to reflect the current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing the 'Mariette Blazer'. Historic demand shows a clear seasonal peak in March/April followed by a stabilization in May. The carry-over insights indicate that since Period 9, the demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the spring peak. Analyzing demand from Period 9 to 15: [178, 130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143], the average is approximately 161 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 220 units. There are significant in-transit quantities: Period 12 (0), Period 13 (96), Period 14 (185), and Period 15 (213), totaling 494 units. These are scheduled to arrive in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19 respectively. Since the lead time has been consistently 4 periods, I will stick with the promised L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=7 to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~161) and ignore the earlier high-growth spring phase. This prevents over-ordering as we enter early June, which likely sees lower demand for structured blazers compared to early spring.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we have 52 units on-hand and 638 units in-transit. The recent demand history (P12-P16: 191, 160, 196, 143, 168) shows a mean of 171.6, confirming the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights after the spring peak. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods, but the order placed in Period 12 (0 units) concluded in Period 16 with 'arrived=0', which is expected. The next expected arrival is the Period 13 order (96 units) in Period 17, followed by the Period 14 order (185 units) in Period 18. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the lead time is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=8 (periods 9-16) to capture the stabilized post-peak demand regime, as this range reflects the current early summer context better than the full history or the spring peak. This results in a mu_hat of ~858 ((1+4)*171.6) and a sigma_hat based on the same period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-spring peak: Mean demand from Period 9-16 is 161.6 units, significantly lower than the P1-P8 peak (avg 211.6).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are firmly in the post-spring peak for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (Periods 9-17) has stabilized at a mean of 156.4 units, down from the early spring peak of ~211 units. The Period 12 order (placed for 0 units) correctly reflected the large build-up of inventory at that time. However, Period 16 showed a 'missed' arrival in the conclude message (0 units arrived), although the Period 12 order was for 0 units anyway. The Period 13 order of 96 units arrived on time in Period 17 (lead time = 4). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With only 30 units on hand and 710 in-transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17), we must ensure we accurately forecast for the current lower-demand regime to avoid overstocking as the summer progresses, while covering the (L+1) window. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering the stable period since the drop at Period 9) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a stabilized post-peak demand regime for the early summer period (June). Recent demand (P9-P18) has averaged approximately 151 units, which is significantly lower than the spring peak (P1-P8 avg ~211). Current on-hand inventory is 76, with 623 units in-transit. The order from Period 12 (0 units) concluded correctly in Period 16, resulting in the 'arrived=0' message. All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Since the current demand is stable but exhibits moderate volatility (standard deviation ~23 over the last 10 periods), I'm using a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for recent accuracy against the volatility seen in the stabilizing phase. L is set to calculated as the lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P9-P18) continues to stabilize with a mean of ~151 units, confirming the end of the spring seasonal surge.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a Mariette Blazer, a spring/summer professional garment. Historical data shows a clear seasonality: an early spring peak (P1-P8, avg ~212) followed by a stabilization at a lower level as summer approaches (P9-P19, avg ~151). The most recent 5 periods (P15-P19) show a demand mean of 138 units, indicating a slight further cooling as we enter late June (Period 20, Date 2019/6/24). In-transit inventory includes Period 16 (144 units), Period 17 (168 units), Period 18 (98 units), and Period 19 (129 units), totaling 539 units, all within the standard 4-period lead time. No shipments are currently lost (Period 12's order of 0 arrived as expected on P16). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the post-peak era since Period 9) to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the stabilized late-season demand pattern while maintaining enough buffer for the moderate volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P15-P19 average demand dropped to 138 units, down from the 161.6 average observed in the P9-P16 window.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer), which has seen a significant demand deceleration as the spring season concludes and summer begins. Demand in Period 20 dropped to 73 units, the lowest observed in the game. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand is 124 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 20 noted a stabilized drop, and P20 data confirms a further sharp decline. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods (P20 arrival was from P16). Given the low demand in P20 and the summer seasonality for a long-sleeved blazer, I am projecting a lower demand mean (mu_hat) by using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent downward trend. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower volatility associated with this lower demand regime. I will maintain the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new low in Period 20 (73 units). The 5-period average (P16-P20) is 124 units, representing a further ~20% decrease from the previously stabilized mean of ~151-161 units, confirming summer seasonality trough.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant demand trough as we enter July, which is consistent with the summer seasonal decline for women's tailoring/blazers. Period 20 recorded the lowest demand of the game (73 units), and the Period 21 demand (116 units) remains well below the spring peaks. The 3-period average (P19-P21) is approximately 104 units, and the 5-period average (P17-P21) is approximately 113.6 units. Given the 'On-hand' inventory of 290 and 'In-transit' of 334 units (total pipeline 624), we are heavily overstocked for the current demand regime. The carry-over insights correctly identified this deceleration. I will setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand environment (avg ~114 per period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility of this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at summer trough: P17-P21 average (113.6 units) is ~46% lower than the P1-P8 peak average (211.6), confirming deep summer seasonality for blazers.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is the heart of the summer season. The product, a 'Mariette Blazer', has exhibited a clear seasonal decline from its spring peak (~211 units) to a summer trough. The demand over the last five periods (P18-P22) has averaged 110 units (139, 122, 73, 116, 120). The demand for Period 20 (73) appears to be a local minimum, with subsequent demands stabilizing around 115-120 units. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at 4 periods. With 268 units on-hand and 236 units in-transit (total pipeline of 504 units), and a current weekly demand mean of ~110 units, the inventory position covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. While the current stock is nearly sufficient, a small replenishment may be triggered by the OR backend depending on the sigma calculation. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized summer trough regime (P18-P22).

Carry-over insight: Summer trough confirmed: Demand from P18-P22 has stabilized around a mean of 110 units, representing the baseline for professional workwear during peak summer months.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its summer trough, characterized by lower demand as professional spring/summer wardrobe purchasing has concluded. Period 23 concluded with a demand of 120, and the last 5 periods (P19-P23) have averaged 110.2 units. Recent performance (P21-P23) shows a stable cluster around 116-120 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods without exceptions. Current on-hand inventory is 277 units with 220 in-transit (orders from P20 and P23). Given the stability of the summer trough and the 4-period lead time, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current demand mean and variance. This strategy prevents over-ordering for a product category that likely won't see another major uptick until the fall collection transition, while maintaining sufficient stock for the existing baseline demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-69.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer continues to sit in its summer trough, with Period 24 demand reaching a low of 63 units. The 5-period average (P20-P24) is approximately 98 units, reflecting the seasonal low for tailored womenswear in mid-to-late July. Current on-hand inventory (321) plus in-transit stock (207) totaling 528 units is sufficient to cover over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (approx 100 units/period). Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the current low demand regime, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs during this trough. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current summer demand levels and narrow volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed through Period 24: 5-period average (P20-P24) has dropped to ~98 units, significantly lower than the P18-P22 average of 110 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a summer demand trough, with the most recent demand (P25) at 94 units and a 5-period average (P21-P25) of approximately 82.6 units. The product's seasonality suggests that demand for professional tailoring like blazers will likely begin to increase again in late August/early September as customers prepare for the fall season. Currently, we have 227 units on-hand and 224 in-transit (orders from P23, P24, and P25). The order from Period 21 (0 units) and Period 22 (0 units) explains the lack of arrival in Period 25. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent throughout the history. To manage the current trough while preparing for a potential late-August uptick, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime, and L to default. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N of 10 to capture both the recent low volatility and the slightly higher volatility seen in July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a summer demand trough, though Period 26 showed a slight uptick to 146 units. We are now in mid-August (2019/08/12), which typically marks the beginning of the 'Back-to-Work' and Fall fashion transition. Historical demand during the recent summer trough (P22-P26) averaged approximately 108 units. Given the transition toward late August, I expect demand to gradually return to the post-peak mean of approximately 140-150 units observed in early summer before the deep trough. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order should arrive in P25, but P21 order was 0; P23 order is expected in P27). Current on-hand inventory is 81 units and in-transit is 344 units. To ensure we have enough stock for the emerging Fall demand while minimizing holding costs (which are 25% of profit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand volatility while acknowledging the seasonal pivot. Method 'calculate' for L is appropriate as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Initial signs of summer trough exit; Period 26 demand (146) is 35% higher than the P22-P25 average (108).

Daily Reward (R_t): $776.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has spiked significantly in Period 27 to 301 units, following a high of 146 in Period 26. This confirms the start of the late-summer/early-fall retail bump as consumers return to office/workwear routines in late August. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) and demand in Period 27 was partially lost (107 units lost). Pipeline inventory includes P24 (94), P25 (17), P26 (120), and P27 (161). The order from Period 23 arrived on time (L=4), but orders from Periods 21 and 22 never arrived (ordered=0), and Period 12 was a no-arrival period as well. I will set L to 'default' as the lead time of 4 is consistent when orders are actually placed. For demand forecasting, I will shift to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the sharp upward momentum (3-period average: 180 units) moving into the autumn peak, which should naturally increase the base stock calculation to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained exit from summer trough confirmed: Period 27 demand (301) and Period 26 (146) show a clear upward trend (3-period avg 180 vs P20-P24 avg 98), marking the start of the Autumn/Fall season surge.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has surged significantly as the season transitions into autumn (August). Period 27 demand was 301 and Period 28 was 251, a sharp increase from the summer trough of ~100. This follows the documented 'Autumn/Fall season surge'. We are currently out of stock (Ending On-hand: 0) and the pipeline needs to be aggressive to capture this peak before it potentially levels off or turns. Lead times are stable at 4 periods. Given the rapid change, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect the new demand level (mean of the last two periods ~276, times (1+L)=5) to 1380 units. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the increased volatility of this new regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a high base stock to refill on-hand inventory while accounting for the seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall demand surge confirmed: Demand in P27 (301) and P28 (251) is 150% higher than the P22-P25 summer trough average (108).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has surged significantly entering the Autumn season. Demand in the last three periods (P27: 301, P28: 251, P29: 231) averages 261 units, which is 2.4x the summer trough average (~108). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand 0 at the end of P27, P28, and P29) due to this rapid shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the surge, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~261). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with the seasonal peak transition. These parameters will raise the base stock level to better meet the Autumn demand and recover from the current stockout position.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall demand surge confirms a high-demand regime starting Period 27: 3-period average (P27-P29) is 261 units (+140% vs summer trough).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of a strong Autumn/Fall demand surge for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (P27-P30) has been 301, 251, 231, and 357, resulting in a 4-period average of ~285 units. This is a massive increase (+164%) from the summer trough average of 108. Inventory is currently critical: we have 0 on-hand and have experienced stockouts for the last four periods, indicating the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend likely limited previous orders. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward shift and the start of September (peak professional wear season), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility associated with high-volume periods. This configuration will signal the backend to raise the base-stock level significantly to satisfy the Autumn surge and recover from the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall high-demand regime confirmed (P27-P30): Average demand has stabilized at ~285 units, a 164% increase over the summer trough (avg 108).

We are in a high-demand Autumn/Fall season surge for the Mariette Blazer (Date: 2019/9/16). The demand has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 27. The most recent demand samples are [301, 251, 231, 357, 328], yielding a 5-period average (N=5) of 293.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P27 order. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant unmet demand (stockouts in the last 5 periods). The OR backend must optimize base stock to cover demand across the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the sharp regime shift and consistent high demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current seasonal peak for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall high-demand regime further confirmed: P27-P31 average demand is 293.6 units, marking a 170% increase over the summer trough baseline (~108 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Autumn/Fall demand surge. Demand from Period 27 to 32 has averaged 301.5 units, which is significantly higher than the initial pre-game and summer trough levels. The most recent demand (P32) was 341. Stockouts have occurred consistently from P27 to P32 due to this rapid surge, leading to 0 ending inventory and missed sales. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P31 and P32). To address the current regime and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) of the Autumn surge to capture the higher mean (~301). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using this N=6 window to account for the increased volatility during this peak. This will set a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) at the current high demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall high-demand regime (P27-P32) mean stabilized at 301.5 units, a nearly 3x increase from the summer trough (avg 108).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1628.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has reached its Autumn peak, with Period 33 seeing a massive spike to 612 units. This is likely due to transition-to-fall shopping or a specific promotion. The average demand across the current high-regime (P27-P33) has jumped to 345 units, up from the ~300 average observed previously. On-hand inventory is completely depleted (0 units) despite a large arrival of 407 units, indicating we are under-stocking for this peak. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. We must adjust mu_hat to capture this recent acceleration. I will use recent_N=7 to cover the growth from the start of the Autumn regime (P27-P33), which provides a more aggressive mean (345.8) compared to the long-term average. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the seasonal surge and the high current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Period 33 demand spiked to 612 units; P27-P33 mean demand is now 345.8 units (+240% vs summer trough).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn/Fall high-demand regime for the Mariette Blazer. Period 33 exhibited a massive spike (612 units), while Period 34 returned to a level (313 units) consistent with the previously established high-demand average (~300 units). The mean demand over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is approximately 341.7 units. However, given the extreme outlier in P33 and the subsequent stabilization back to ~313, a recent_N approach targeting the last 8 periods (N=8) provides a robust estimate of the current high-demand mu, capturing the seasonal surge while dampening the outlier. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 8 units on hand and a high pipeline, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to sustain the high service level required by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall high-demand regime (starting P27) mean demand over P27-P34 has stabilized around 342 units, despite a significant single-period spike in P33.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in a sustained Autumn/Fall high-demand regime that began around Period 27. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P27-P35) is approximately 335 units, which is a significant increase from the summer trough (~108 units). Although Period 33 featured a massive spike to 612 units, recent periods (P34 at 313 and P35 at 283) suggest the demand is stabilizing at a high plateau rather than continuing an exponential climb. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods. With only 12 periods remaining in the game and a current on-hand inventory of only 34 units against a large pipeline (1613 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture the full Autumn regime average (approx 335/period). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 will account for the high volatility introduced by the P33 spike. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal demand while maintaining a buffer for late-season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall high-demand regime (P27-P35) stabilized: Mean demand is approximately 335 units, a 210% increase over the summer trough baseline (~108 units/period).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized in the high-demand Autumn/Fall regime that began around Period 27 (2019/08/12). The mean demand from P27 to P36 is approximately 340 units, significantly higher than previous periods. While there was a large spike in P33 (612 units), subsequent periods (P34-P36) have returned to the 280-315 range, confirming that while volatility is present, the regime is relatively stable. Inventory is currently critical; on-hand inventory is 0, though a large pipeline of 1656 units is in transit. Observed lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. Given the high demand and the stockout in the most recent period (P36), I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (P27-P36) to capture this entire Autumn regime, which provides a mean demand of 340. units per period. I will also use the last 10 periods for sigma_hat to account for the high variance introduced by the P33 spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock. This strategy aims to maximize sales during this peak season while managing the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime (P27-P36) mean remains stable at ~340 units/period, despite high single-period volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 108).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized in the high-demand Autumn/Fall regime that began around Period 27. The mean demand for the last ten completed periods (P28-P37) is 331.1 units, while the most recent 5-period average (P33-P37) is 360.6 units (inclusive of a 612-unit outlier in P33). Excluding the outlier, the demand remains remarkably stable around 300-340 units. Lead times have consistently returned to the promised 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals for P34-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 56, with a significant pipeline of 1481 units. The backlog from previously missed sales (P27-P33) has been partially mitigated by the large orders arriving now. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the start of the Autumn regime at P27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current seasonal volatility and mean while smoothing out the P33 spike. This ensures the OR backend targets the elevated baseline without over-ordering on a single peak, while L is set to calculate to maintain the 4-period observed reliability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' is in its Autumn/Fall holiday peak. Demand has averaged approximately 340 units since Period 27, though we see an increase in recent weeks, with Period 38 demand reaching 385 units. On-hand inventory is 225 units, and in-transit inventory is healthy at 1223 units. Given the seasonality of blazers, we are approaching the November peak (Black Friday/early winter prep). I will continue to use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the elevated Autumn regime (starting P27) while including some late-summer data to temper the volatility of the recent 612-unit spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=12) to reflect the high volatility (\xb1108 units) observed during this peak season. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime remains stable with a slight upward trend as of P38 (demand 385). Average demand since P27 is ~344 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn/Fall high-demand regime, which began around Period 27. The mean demand from Period 27 to Period 39 is approximately 336 units per period. While Period 33 saw a spike (612) and Period 39 saw a dip (231), the overall trend remains elevated compared to the summer trough. The date is Nov 11, nearing the end of the Autumn season but potentially approaching holiday-related professional dressing needs. However, looking at the inventory, 'On-hand' is 487 and 'In-transit' is 1132 units, totaling 1619 units. Assuming the stable mean of ~336 units, our current coverage is approximately 1619 / 336 \u2248 4.8 periods. Given the lead time is 4, we are well-covered for the lead time plus the decision period. For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' as actual lead times have consistently matched the promised 4 periods. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the entire Autumn regime from P27-P39) to capture the current high-demand average of ~336. 3) sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=13 to reflect the high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 104) observed during this regime, ensuring the safety stock maintains a high service level without excessive holding costs given the current inventory surplus.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer remains in a high-demand Autumn/Fall regime (P27-P40), with a mean demand of approximately 334 units. Recent demand (P39-P40) has slightly softened to 231 and 278, but the overall seasonal strength is expected to persist through mid-November. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 449 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 1084 units in-transit. Lead times have remained stable at the promised 4 periods. Given the high demand and the OR backend's service level target (critical ratio ~80% for profit 4 and holding 1), I will use a recent_N approach (N=14, covering the regime since P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the system accounts for the current seasonal elevated demand and volatility while inventory levels are managed against the upcoming end-of-year transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Fall high-demand regime (P27-P40) remains the dominant pattern with a mean demand of ~334 units and high volatility (\u03c3 ~94).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, positioning the product (Mariette Blazer) just before Black Friday and the lead-up to the end-of-year holiday season. Historically, the Autumn/Fall high-demand regime since Period 27 has maintained a mean of approximately 334 units with significant volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 94). However, the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) show a slight cooling from the October peak, with an average demand of 278.4 units. Despite this minor deceleration, the proximity to major retail events like Black Friday and the transition into winter workwear/social attire necessitates maintaining a robust base stock. I will use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire Autumn/Fall regime dynamics since P27 while smoothing out the extreme P33 spike. Recent arrivals confirm the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 398 units, and the pipeline is substantial (1145 units), reflecting orders placed during the high-demand October phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 (Autumn/Fall) has entered a more stable but still high-demand phase; P37-P41 average is ~278 units, slightly lower than the P27-P36 peak average of ~340 units, but remains much higher than the summer baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2776.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (733 units),likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday (Date: 2019/11/25). This exhausted all on-hand inventory. The current date is December 2nd, indicating we are still in the peak holiday shopping season. Historical data shows that while demand is volatile, the Autumn/Fall regime (starting P27) has been sustained. The Period 42 spike is an outlier compared to the P37-P41 average of ~278, but given the seasonal context (December), we must ensure sufficient safety stock. Pipeline inventory is currently 1066 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand (~270-300 units). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 (covering the start of the Autumn regime) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen in the last few periods (including the spike). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (733 units), coinciding with Black Friday week. This marks extreme seasonal volatility within the high-demand Autumn/Winter regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 follows the massive Black Friday demand spike (733 units in P42), which resulted in a stockout. Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 169 units, which is typical post-holiday exhaustion but still within the broader Autumn/Winter high-demand regime. The carry_over_insight confirms we are in a high-volatility, high-demand phase (avg ~334-340 units since P27). However, with the end of the year approaching (P44-P47), we must account for both the remains of holiday shopping and the potential for a clearance or late-winters season. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the backend's target service level (q = 0.8) is high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the demand since the Autumn regime began (P27), which provides a stable mean of approximately 324 units while acknowledging the extreme volatility (holiday spike). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the remaining 4 periods of the game without overstocking drastically as we approach the final period (P47).

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand correction observed in Period 43 (169 units). High-demand regime remains active but highly volatile (P27-P43 avg ~324 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1095.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16). The 'Mariette Blazer' is in its Autumn/Winter high-demand regime, which has been extremely volatile recently due to Black Friday (P42 demand: 733) and the subsequent correction (P43 demand: 169). The most recent demand (P44: 304) is close to the regime average of ~324 units observed since P27. With only 2 periods left in the game after this decision (P46 and P47), we must ensure we cover the remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs on the final periods. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 49\u2014after the game ends. Therefore, my parameters are primarily focused on the OR engine's internal logic for managing the large 'In-transit' pipeline of 1502 units and protecting against any late-season volatility. I will use a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime since P27 (averaging ~323 units), which provides a stable baseline for these final decisions.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), approaching the end of the calendar (Period 47). The demand context is the post-Black Friday stabilization within the high-demand Autumn/Winter regime. Period 45 demand was 258 units, following several periods of high volatility (733 in P42, 169 in P43, 304 in P44). The average demand since the Autumn regime began (P27) is approximately 320 units, but recent weeks (P43-P45) show a slightly lower mean of ~244 units as the holiday peak subsides. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only two periods left in the game and a significant in-transit pipeline (1535 units), the inventory position is extremely high relative to remaining demand. However, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit new ordering. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to capture the high-demand regime while allowing for the recent slight cooling from the extreme Black Friday peak. Sigma_hat is set with recent_N=10 to reflect the current high volatility environment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (late December), following the Christmas/New Year holiday period. Recent demand history shows a typical seasonal pattern: a massive peak during Black Friday (P42: 733 units), a sharp correction (P43: 169 units), and moderate stabilization (P44-P45 avg ~281). However, Period 46 saw a drop to 128 units, likely due to holiday-week slowdowns or stock-out effects if specific sizes were unavailable. Looking ahead, we expect demand to transition from the Autumn/Winter peak toward the start of Spring professional wear in mid-to-late Q1. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (Autumn/Fall/Holiday) is highly volatile (Black Friday spike and subsequent drops), using a recent window (N=5) captures the most relevant volume (averaging 232.4 units) without being overly skewed by the extreme P42 outlier. My inventory position (On-hand: 207, In-transit: 1558) is very high relative to current demand, suggesting we need to decelerate orders to avoid excessive holding costs as the season potentially turns or matures.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand slowdown observed in Period 46 (128 units), marking the end of the high-volatility Autumn/Winter peak. Post-Black Friday (P43-P46) mean demand has settled at 214.8 units compared to the P27-P41 mean of ~334.
