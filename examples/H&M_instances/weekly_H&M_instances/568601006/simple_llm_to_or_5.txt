SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last five periods shows a fluctuating but generally upward movement (161, 145, 179, 196, 186), with an average of 173.4. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is February 11, 2019. This coincides with the transition from winter to spring. The 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) is a professional, dressed item that typically sees increased demand during the 'Spring/Back-to-Work' season as consumers update their professional wardrobes. 3. Trend Analysis: There is a visible upward trend starting from 145 up to nearly 200, though the most recent period saw a slight dip to 186. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the seasonal push for professional attire in mid-February and the recent momentum, I expect demand to remain strong and slightly exceed the recent average.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The training data shows stable demand (161-196) with an average of 173.4. 2. Recent Observation: Period 1 recorded 227 units, a significant jump (~30% increase) from the training average. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: February 18th is post-Valentine's Day but enters the peak spring office-wear shopping season for women's tailoring. The 'Mariette Blazer' is a staple 'Dressed' item likely benefiting from a seasonal transition toward spring wardrobes. 4. Trend Analysis: The shift from the ~170 level to 227 suggests an upward seasonal momentum as we move further into February. 5. Forecast Logic: Given the strong start in Period 1 (227) and the seasonal relevance of the product category, I expect demand to remain elevated but stabilize or slightly increase as the spring shopping season builds. I will forecast a slight increase over the Period 1 actual.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The initial training data showed stable demand between 145-196 (avg ~173). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date (late February) transitions into the spring office-wear season. As a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, demand typically increases as customers refresh their professional wardrobes for spring. 3. Trend Analysis: Recent observed demand shows a sharp upward trajectory (227 in Period 1 to 284 in Period 2), representing a ~25% week-over-week increase. 4. Final Forecast Logic: The demand has clearly broken above the initial training range. Given the momentum and the seasonal relevance of the product in late February, a further moderate increase is expected as the spring shopping season picks up pace.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical Pattern: The training data (Periods -4 to 0) showed an average demand of 173.4 units. In the test phase, demand has significantly increased, with an average of 236.3 units over the last three weeks. 2) Seasonal/Calendar: The date is March 4th. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed), this product enters its peak spring season. March often sees a rise in demand for professional and smart-casual attire for spring transitions and events. 3) Trend Analysis: There was a sharp spike in Period 2 (284) followed by a correction in Period 3 (198). Despite the dip, the level remains well above the initial training average. 4) Logic: I expect demand to stabilize or slightly rebound as the spring season solidifies. Given the volatility (227 -> 284 -> 198), a weighted average favoring the recent shift suggests a forecast in the 210-230 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-Feb 11th demand average increased from ~173 to ~236 (+36%) compared to training data, coinciding with the start of the Spring retail season.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Training data average was 173.4 units. 2. Recent Performance: Test phase demand for periods 1-4 (Feb 11 - Mar 4) averaged 230.75 units, confirming a shift toward higher demand. 3. Seasonal/Calendar: The current date is March 11, which is deep into the Spring retail season for women's tailoring (blazers). Demand in the last two periods (198, 214) has stabilized lower than the initial spike of 284 but remains significantly above the historical baseline. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the stabilization between 200-220 units over the last two weeks and the continued seasonal relevance of a 'Womens Tailoring' item in March, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase as the weather warms. I am forecasting 218 units, reflecting the recent average while accounting for the ongoing spring trend.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged ~173 units. Since entering the 'Spring' season (Feb 11th onwards), the demand shifted to a higher regime. The average of the last five periods (227, 284, 198, 214, 215) is 227.6 units. Specifically, the last three periods (Periods 3, 4, and 5) show a stabilization around a mean of 209 units (198, 214, 215), suggesting the initial surge in Period 2 (284) has settled into a steady seasonal plateau. March 18th is firmly within the spring tailoring season for a 'Mariette Blazer'. Given the stability over the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain consistent with the recent average of approximately 210-215 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 173 units. Since the start of the Spring season in February (Test Period 1), the demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 225 units. Over the last four weeks (Periods 3-6), the demand has demonstrated significant stability, specifically plateauing at 215 units for the most recent two weeks (Periods 5 and 6). Given the current date of March 25th falls within the peak Spring retail window for tailored items like blazers, demand is expected to remain firm. The forecast maintains this current plateau, reflecting the steady state observed over the last three weeks.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (a women's tailoring item) showed an initial training average of ~173. Upon entering the Spring season (Feb/March), the 'Carry-over Insight' noted a regime shift to ~236. However, looking at the recent test data (Periods 1-7), the demand initially spiked (227, 284) but has since stabilized and trended downwards. The average of the last three periods (5, 6, 7) is ~205. Specifically, Period 7 saw a drop to 186 units. As we enter April (Period 8), we are in the peak of the Spring professional wear season, but the immediate trend is cooling from the February peak. I expect demand to stabilize near the 200 mark, accounting for the slight downward momentum from the previous week's 186.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 173 units. Since entering the test phase (Spring season), demand shifted upward to an average of 223.5 units (P1-P8). While the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~236, the actual performance from P3-P7 was slightly lower (average ~206). However, Period 8 saw a significant surge to 249 units. As we enter the second week of April, demand for a women's blazer is expected to remain high due to peak Spring retail activity and upcoming Easter holiday (April 21, 2019) preparations for 'smart' attire. The forecast weights the recent upward momentum of P8 against the established Spring average.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has maintained a higher average in the test phase (avg 218) compared to the training data (avg 173). Recent demand has shown volatility, with a spike in Period 8 (249 units) followed by a dip in Period 9 (178 units). Current period 10 (April 15, 2019) coincides with the week leading up to Easter Sunday (April 21). As a 'Dressed' tailoring item, the blazer is likely to see a moderate seasonal lift for holiday events and Spring professional wear. Based on the overall test mean of ~218 and the expectation of a recovery from the Period 9 dip due to the holiday, the forecast is set near the season-to-date average.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data showed a baseline average of ~173. Following the Period 4 insight, demand shifted higher for the early Spring season (P1-P8 average of ~223). However, the most recent two periods show a sharp downward trajectory: Period 9 (178) and Period 10 (130). Period 10 was the week leading into Easter (April 21, 2019), and Period 11 (April 22) is the post-holiday week. Typically, demand for 'Dressed' tailoring like this blazer peaks for spring events/holidays and tapers off immediately following them. Given the steep decline to 130, I expect demand to remain low as the post-holiday lull continues, likely settling near or slightly below the original training baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (a women's tailoring item) showed a peak in the early spring season (Feb-March), averaging around 215-225 units. However, a significant downward trend has emerged over the last three periods (Period 9: 178, Period 10: 130, Period 11: 127), indicating the end of the peak spring shopping window for formal tailoring. The current date is April 29th, moving into May. While late April/early May can see occasional spikes for spring events, the current momentum is sharply negative. The demand has dropped approximately 40% from the mid-season average. I expect demand to stabilize at this lower level or continue a slight decline as the product moves out of its primary seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Post-April 8th demand has dropped from a seasonal average of ~215 to ~145 (-33%), signaling the end of the primary spring tailoring peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (161-196) and the initial spring peak (Avg ~215 through Period 8) established a high baseline for this blazer. Periods 9-11 saw a significant decline (averaging ~145), which triggered the previous carry-over insight regarding the end of the spring tailoring peak. However, Period 12 (April 29) showed a sharp rebound to 191 units. Given the current date of May 6, we are entering a secondary demand window for late spring/early summer occasions (e.g., graduations, weddings, May bank holidays). The jump from 127 to 191 indicates that the 'end of peak' noted in Period 12 may have been premature or that a new stabilization level is forming higher than the 145 average. I expect demand to remain relatively strong but potentially settle slightly lower than the immediate pre-holiday spike seen in Period 12.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a distinct drop in demand following the early spring peak (Periods 1-8 avg: ~223). Since Period 9 (April 8th), demand has entered a lower regime. While Period 12 saw a brief spike to 191, Period 13 returned to a lower level of 160. For Period 14 (mid-May), as the season transitions further into summer, Blazers (tailoring) typically experience stable or slightly declining demand compared to the spring peak. The average of the most recent four periods (130, 127, 191, 160) is approximately 152. Given the most recent observation of 160 and the general downward seasonal trend from the spring highs, I forecast a similar level, slightly adjusted for the stabilizing trend seen in the last two weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. After an initial Spring peak (Periods 1-8 avg: ~224), demand shifted downward around Period 9. The most recent period (Period 14) saw 196 units, following 160 units in Period 13. The current date (May 20) is late Spring/early Summer, where demand for tailored blazers typically stabilizes before the summer lull. Recent demand (Periods 12-14) shows a volatile but slightly recovering mean of ~182. Given the previous period's 196 and the general stabilization after the post-peak drop, I expect demand to remain within the 170-190 range. Weighting the most recent observation of 196 alongside the post-peak average suggests a forecast near 180.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged ~173. The 'Spring peak' (Periods 1-9) saw an average of ~218. Following the insight from Period 12, a regime shift occurred where demand dropped. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 10-15), the demand has averaged approximately 158 units. Specifically, the last four periods (12-15) show a fluctuating but generally lower pattern (191, 160, 196, 143) with an average of 172.5. However, the very latest data (Period 15) shows a significant drop to 143. Given we are in late May (transitioning out of prime spring tailoring season and towards summer), demand for a 'Mariette Blazer' is expected to remain stable or slightly soften. The forecast weights the recent average of ~158-165 while acknowledging the downward pressure seen in the most recent observation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) showed a high-demand spring phase (avg ~215) followed by a drop starting in mid-April (Period 10) to a lower regime. Since Period 12, where the 'Carry-Over Insight' noted a shift to ~145, the actual demand has fluctuated but stabilized at a higher level than that initial drop. Recent demand (Periods 12-16) shows values of 191, 160, 196, 143, and 168, averaging 171.6. The current date (June 3) is moving into the early summer season where interest in structured tailoring typically experiences a minor lull before summer sales or transitions. However, demand remains relatively resilient compared to the late April lows. Period 16 was 168; given the recent 5-period average (172) and the slight downward volatility in the most recent two weeks, I expect demand to remain within this stabilized lower-seasonal range.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (161-196) and initial test periods (Avg ~230) showed a strong spring peak for this Mariette Blazer. Following Period 12, a regime shift was noted where demand dropped to ~145. Analyzing the most recent five periods (P13-P17: 160, 196, 143, 168, 118), the average is approximately 157. However, the last three periods show a downward trend (143, 168, 118), with Period 17 reaching a new low of 118. As we enter mid-June (June 10), demand for structured 'Womens Tailoring' like blazers typically softens as consumers shift toward summer-specific lightweight apparel. Given the sharp drop in Period 17 and the seasonal entry into summer, a forecast slightly below the recent average is appropriate to account for this cooling trend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:

Historical analysis shows a distinct drop in demand following the Spring peak, which was previously identified in the Period 12 carry-over insight (drop from ~215 to ~145). Since that shift, demand has averaged approximately 154 units (Periods 13-18). Focusing on the most recent month (Periods 15-18), the average is slightly lower at 142 units, with the most recent observation at 139. As the current date is mid-June, demand for a blazer is expected to remain in this lower summer plateau, away from the early spring peaks. The forecast weights the most recent three periods (avg: 141.6) and the established post-peak average (~145) to predict a stable demand of 142.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer has shown a distinct seasonal pattern. After a high-demand Spring peak (averaging ~218 units through Period 9), demand shifted to a lower regime. The Period 12 carry-over insight noted a drop to an average of ~145 units. Recent performance in Periods 17-19 (118, 139, 122) shows a further softening, with a three-week average of 126 units. This decline coincides with the late June transition into the peak summer season, where demand for structured tailoring typically wanes. The forecast of 126 units reflects the recent three-period mean and anticipates demand remaining in this lower summer range.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear decline as we move into the height of summer. The training data averaged ~173, followed by a spring peak (Period 1-9) averaging ~220. A carry-over insight noted a shift to ~145 after April 8th. More recently (Periods 17-20), demand has dropped significantly from the 140-160 range down to a 4-week average of 113. Period 20 recorded the lowest demand yet (73 units). As of July 1st, we are in the warmest part of the summer season for the Northern Hemisphere, where demand for 'Womens Tailoring' and 'Dressed' woven blazers typically hits its annual trough before the late-summer/pre-fall transition. The recent drop from 122 to 73 suggests a final clearance or end-of-season lull. I expect demand to remain at this lower baseline or slightly recover from the sharp drop in Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Post-June demand has dropped to a new baseline of ~100 or lower, marking the summer seasonal trough for tailoring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal progression for the Mariette Blazer. After a strong spring peak (avg ~215), demand entered a transitional phase in May (avg ~161) and has since fallen into a summer trough starting in June (avg ~113). The most recent data points (P20: 73, P21: 116) confirm the Period 21 carry-over insight that demand has shifted to a lower baseline around or below 100 units. As we are now in the second week of July (2019/7/8), a period typically characterized by high temperatures and summer vacations, demand for tailored blazers is expected to remain suppressed. The bounce back from 73 to 116 in the previous period suggests some volatility within this low-demand regime, but no recovery to spring levels is anticipated. I will forecast a value near the recent 5-period average (113.6) and 3-period average (103.6), leaning towards the lower end to account for the sustained summer seasonal trough.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its summer seasonal trough. After a sharp decline in Period 20 (73 units), demand has stabilized over the last two weeks (Period 21: 116, Period 22: 120), averaging 118 units. Mid-July (July 15) remains a period of low demand for structured tailoring as consumers focus on summer-weight clothing. While the last two observations show a slight recovery from the Period 20 low, they remain significantly below the spring average of ~215 and the late spring average of ~145. The forecast assumes demand will remain stable within this established summer baseline of 100-120 units before any pre-fall recovery begins in late August.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in a summer seasonal trough. Historical demand has stabilized significantly over the last three weeks (Period 21: 116, Period 22: 120, Period 23: 120), averaging approximately 119 units. This follows a confirmed downward regime shift noted in June (Period 21 insight). Given the consistency of the last two periods at 120 units and the lack of upcoming major retail events in late July that would typically boost tailoring demand, the forecast maintains the current baseline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its summer seasonal trough, as identified in the Period 21 carry-over insight. Demand for lined blazers typically hits a minimum during the peak summer weeks of July. Recent demand over the last five periods (P20-P24) has averaged 98.4 units, with a noticeable fluctuation between 63 and 120. The most recent observation (P24) showed a sharp drop to 63 units. Given that we are at the end of July (2019/7/29), demand is expected to remain near this established low baseline before any potential 'back-to-office' recovery in late August. I will forecast a value consistent with the recent five-week average, slightly weighted towards the most recent low performance.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal lifecycle for this blazer. Following the Spring peak, demand entered a summer trough around Period 20, as noted in previous insights. Looking at the last five periods (Periods 21-25), demand has averaged approximately 102 units, but with significant volatility (highs of 120, lows of 63). The most recent two periods (63 and 94 units) suggest the product remains in a low-demand regime. August 5th is typically still within the summer clearance/low-demand period for structured tailoring before the 'Back to Work' or Fall transition begins later in the month. Given the recent average and the slight recovery from the Period 24 low, I expect demand to remain stable within the current low-traffic range.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal pattern for this blazer. Following the spring peak (Feb-May), demand entered a summer trough starting in late June (Period 20), as noted in the carry-over insights. Recent demand for Periods 21-25 averaged approximately 102 units. However, Period 26 (Aug 5) shows a significant jump to 146 units. This coincides with the typical retail 'Back to School/Back to Work' transition in mid-August, where demand for tailored items like blazers begins to recover from summer lows. Given the date (Aug 12), I expect this recovery trend to continue or stabilize as the pre-autumn season begins, moving away from the July lows (~60-90) back toward a higher baseline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a new phase. After a summer trough from Period 20 to 25 (averaging ~98 units), demand surged in Period 26 (146 units) and spiked significantly in Period 27 (301 units). This aligns with the 'Back-to-Work' and early Autumn retail season (mid-August), where professional tailoring like blazers experiences peak seasonal relevance. Period 27's 301 units is the highest recorded volume, suggesting a strong regime shift. For Period 28, I expect demand to remain near these elevated levels, though potentially stabilizing slightly after the initial surge, similar to the high-demand peaks observed in the early Spring season (Feb/Mar).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a distinct seasonal pattern for this blazer. After a summer trough in Periods 20-25 (average ~98 units), demand has surged significantly starting in August (Period 26: 146, Period 27: 301, Period 28: 251). This spike aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' and Autumn season launch for women's tailoring. While Period 27 appears to be the initial peak of the transition, Period 28 remains highly elevated. For Period 29 (late August), demand is expected to remain strong as consumers prepare for September, though it may continue to stabilize slightly from the initial seasonal launch spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Post-July demand has surged from a summer baseline of ~98 to a new seasonal average of ~233 (+137%), marking the start of the Autumn/Back-to-Business peak for tailoring.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered the Autumn/Back-to-Business peak season, as evidenced by a sharp increase starting in Period 27. The last three periods (P27: 301, P28: 251, P29: 231) show a high-volume regime with an average of 261 units, significantly higher than the summer trough of ~98. As of September 2nd (Labor Day week), the initial surge is beginning to stabilize. While demand remains high for tailored office wear, there is a slight week-over-week downward trend from the initial peak of 301. I forecast a slight moderation to 225 units, maintaining the high seasonal baseline but acknowledging the cooling trend from the late August peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' is currently in the 'Back-to-Business' autumn peak, as previously identified in the carry-over insights. Recent demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) has averaged approximately 285 units, a significant increase from the summer baseline. The most recent observation (Period 30) shows a sharp spike to 357 units, coinciding with the first week of September, which is typically the height of professional tailoring demand. For Period 31 (Sept 9), while demand remains seasonally high, the extreme spike seen in the previous week may stabilize slightly or remain near that peak. Given the strong momentum and seasonal relevance of a fitted blazer in early September, I expect demand to remain in the 300-340 range. I will forecast a slight moderation from the P30 peak but stay well above the P27-P29 average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a significant Autumn peak. Following the initial surge in August (averaging ~233), the first two weeks of September (Period 30 and 31) have seen demand jump further to an average of 342.5 units (357 and 328 respectively). This aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' retail cycle where tailoring products see maximum seasonal relevance. Although Period 31 showed a slight 8% decrease from Period 30, the demand remains consistently above the 300-unit threshold. For Period 32 (Sept 16), I expect demand to remain in this high-volume regime as the seasonal peak continues, forecasting slightly below the two-week average to account for the minor cooling seen in the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Post-August demand has increased from ~233 to a new peak seasonal average of ~340 (+46%), representing the height of the Autumn tailoring season.

The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-volume seasonal peak corresponding with the Autumn/Back-to-Business period. Following a baseline shift in August (avg ~233), demand surged again starting in Period 30 (Sept 2). The last three observations (357, 328, and 341) show a very stable and sustained demand regime with an average of approximately 342 units. As Period 33 (Sept 23) remains within the core window for Autumn tailoring and there is no evidence of a downward trend yet, the forecast is set at 340, aligning with the current high-demand baseline identified in the Period 32 carry-over insight.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Autumn season. Previous analysis (Period 32) established a seasonal baseline of approximately 340 units. However, Period 33 showed a significant spike to 612 units (+80% above the recent average). While this sharp increase might be influenced by a specific end-of-month event or a promotional period, the magnitude suggests a high-demand regime. Following such a large spike, demand often regresses toward the mean but remains elevated during the peak season. Therefore, the forecast for Period 34 (Sep 30) anticipates a slight cooling from the 612 peak while remaining well above the previous 340 baseline, settling in at 425 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Autumn/Back-to-Business season. Historical data shows a clear progression: a baseline of ~233 in August (P26-P29) followed by a confirmed regime shift to a higher average of ~340 in September (P30-P32). Period 33 exhibited a massive spike (612 units), which likely represents a specific promotional event or a major month-end payday surge. Period 34 (313 units) shows a return to the established seasonal baseline of ~315-340. For Period 35 (Oct 7), I expect demand to remain steady within this peak Autumn range. While the trend is slightly lower than the average of the last three weeks due to the P33 outlier, it aligns with the 'Peak Autumn' baseline established in earlier periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer peaked in September (Periods 30-32 avg ~342) and experienced a massive outlier spike in Period 33 (612 units). Following this spike, demand has shown a clear downward trend: 313 units in Period 34 and 283 units in Period 35. This suggests the peak Autumn tailoring season is beginning to taper off as the calendar moves further into October (Oct 14th). I expect the downward trend to continue as the market transitions toward heavier winter outerwear, projecting a further slight decrease from the most recent observation of 283.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal peak for this blazer during the 'Back-to-Business' window in September, where demand averaged ~340 (excluding the P33 outlier of 612). Since early October, demand has decelerated and stabilized, with the last two periods showing very consistent figures (283 and 282). This suggests the primary autumn peak has passed and the product is entering a more stable mid-season phase. Given the high stability between Period 35 and 36, I expect Period 37 to remain near this new level, with a slight downward bias as the season progresses further into late October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized following the extreme spike in Period 33 (612 units). Over the last four weeks (Periods 34-37), demand has settled into a consistent range between 282 and 313 units, with a four-week average of approximately 298 units. This indicates a slight cooling from the peak September average of ~340 units, which is seasonally expected as the 'Back-to-Business' peak transitions into late autumn. The most recent observation (Period 37) was 313 units. Given the stability of the recent four-period trend and the lack of upcoming major holiday disruptions in the immediate week of Oct 28, the forecast remains anchored to the recent mean of approximately 300 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Post-peak autumn demand has stabilized from ~340 to a new baseline of ~300 (-12%), reflecting the transition from the primary autumn tailoring peak into late-season stability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a transition from the peak Autumn season (~340 units) to a stabilized baseline of ~300 units in October (P34-P37). However, the most recent observation (P38: 385 units) indicates a significant uptick as we enter November. For a 'Dressed' product like the Mariette Blazer, demand typically strengthens in early November as consumers prepare for the holiday event season and 'Back-to-Business' wardrobe updates continue. The forecast weights the recent upward momentum from P38 against the established late-season baseline, anticipating sustained elevated demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: After the Autumn peak (Periods 30-33, avg ~340), the demand stabilized into a 'post-peak' regime around ~300 units (Periods 34-38). 2. Seasonal/Calendar: Period 40 (2019/11/11) marks the move into mid-November. For a tailored blazer, this period often experiences a cooling effect as consumer interest shifts from autumn workwear toward heavy winter outerwear and holiday-specific party wear. 3. Recent Trend: Period 39 saw a significant drop to 231 units from a spike of 385. While Period 38 was likely an outlier, the drop to 231 is the lowest demand seen since late August, suggesting the beginning of a seasonal decline. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the sharp drop in Period 39 and the seasonal timing, the forecast expects demand to remain below the previous 300-unit baseline. I predict a slight stabilization around the 245-255 range as the market transitions out of the primary autumn season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a clear seasonal cycle for the Mariette Blazer, with demand peaking in late September (Period 33: 612 units) before stabilizing around a baseline of ~300 (Periods 34-38 average: 315). The most recent two periods (P39: 231, P40: 278) show a significant drop below that baseline, averaging 254.5 units. This suggests a late-autumn cooling of demand as the primary 'Back-to-Business' season ends. Period 41 (Nov 18) precedes the Black Friday retail peak. While demand often dips slightly as consumers wait for sales, the trend from P39 to P40 is upward (+20%). I expect demand to continue this slight recovery toward the established ~300 baseline as holiday event dressing begins, but remain below the early-autumn peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the Mariette Blazer moved from an Autumn peak (~340 units) into a stabilized late-season phase (~300 units). However, the most recent three periods (39-41) show a further decline to an average of approximately 251 units, indicating a seasonal cooling as winter approaches. Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with Black Friday week. In retail, this period typically sees a significant demand surge across all categories. Given the recent baseline of ~251, and expecting a typical high-impact promotional lift (estimated at 40-50% for a core tailoring item), the forecast anticipates a spike back toward the previous stabilization levels or slightly higher. I am forecasting 375 units to account for the holiday shopping event impact.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 showed a massive spike in Period 42 (733 units), which aligns with the Black Friday 2019 retail event. Historically, this blazer has a baseline of approximately 300 units during the Autumn/Winter season (as noted in Period 38 insights). Period 43 begins on December 2nd, which is Cyber Monday. While demand is expected to drop significantly from the Black Friday peak, the presence of Cyber Monday and the commencement of the December holiday shopping season will likely keep demand slightly above the pre-spike November average of ~251 units. Following the pattern seen after the previous major spike in Period 33 (where demand dropped by roughly 50%), I expect a correction toward the seasonal mean while maintaining some promotional momentum.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a distinct late-autumn baseline of approximately 300 units (Periods 34-38). However, recent weeks have been volatile due to promotional activity: Period 42 saw a massive spike to 733 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), followed by a significant correction in Period 43 to 169 units as demand was pulled forward. Period 44 (starting Dec 9) represents a post-promotion stabilization period. While the long-term autumn average was near 300, December demand for professional tailoring typically softens as the focus shifts toward holiday party wear or winter clearance. Given the 'hangover' effect from the massive Period 42 spike and the late-season date, demand is expected to recover from the Period 43 low but remain below the previous 300-unit baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Extreme volatility detected due to late-November promotional events (733 units), followed by a sharp post-event correction (169 units). The previous baseline of ~300 has been disrupted by seasonality and promotional pull-forward.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized following the extreme volatility of the late-November promotional period. Period 42 saw a spike to 733 (Black Friday), followed by a sharp correction to 169 in Period 43. Period 44 returned to 304, which aligns perfectly with the pre-promotion autumn baseline of ~300 identified in previous insights. As we enter the week of December 16th (Period 45), demand for 'dressed' tailoring typically remains steady due to holiday events, though it may see a marginal softening as the focus shifts toward peak gifting and the upcoming holiday break. Given the recovery to 304 in the most recent period, the forecast assumes a slight seasonal tapering while remaining near the established baseline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23rd, representing Christmas week. Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a peak in autumn (Sept/Oct) and a significant promotional spike during Black Friday (733 units). Post-promotion, demand corrected to 169 units and then stabilized around 304 and 258 units. For 'Dressed' tailoring, the week of Christmas typically experiences a seasonal lull as consumer focus shifts away from professional/tailored attire. Given the 15% drop observed in the previous week (from 304 to 258), I anticipate a further decline during the holiday week, likely settling into a lower range before year-end sales or spring transitions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a post-holiday seasonal transition. Demand patterns show a clear disruption starting with the late-November promotion (Period 42: 733 units), followed by a stabilization in early December (averaging ~280 units). However, Period 46 (2019/12/23) showed a significant drop to 128 units, which is consistent with the Christmas week trough for professional attire. Period 47 (2019/12/30) covers the New Year period. Historically, demand for tailoring begins a modest recovery from the Christmas bottom as consumers transition out of the holiday season and into post-holiday sales, but it remains well below the autumn peak (~300+) or the spring peak (~230+). Given the drop to 128, a recovery towards the 160-180 range is expected, aligning with the early February baseline seen in historical training data.
