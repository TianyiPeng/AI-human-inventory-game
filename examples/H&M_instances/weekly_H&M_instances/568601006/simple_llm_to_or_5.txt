SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', categorized under 'Womens Tailoring / Dressed', tailored for office or formal wear. The current date is February 11, 2019. Historically, the demand sequence [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] shows a generally increasing trend, with the average demand over the last 5 periods being 173.4. February typically marks the transition into the spring retail season where demand for 'fitted jackets' and workwear often increases as customers refresh their professional wardrobes for warmer weather. Given the recent upward trajectory from 161 towards the high 190s and the seasonal timing (mid-February), a forecast that maintains the higher recent level is appropriate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The training data shows stable demand with an average of approximately 173 units (161, 145, 179, 196, 186). (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The date (2019/2/18) falls in late winter/early spring. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this product typically sees increased demand during the transition to spring as consumers update professional and occasion-based wardrobes. (3) Recent trend analysis: Period 1 (2019/2/11) demand was 227 units, which is a significant jump from the historical average (+31%), indicating a seasonal or trend-based shift. (4) Final forecast logic: Given the strong performance in Period 1 and the expectation that the spring tailoring season is ramping up, demand is expected to remain elevated or slightly increase before stabilizing.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: Pre-test training data showed a mean of 173.4 units (Range: 145-196). 2. Observed Demand (Test Phase): Period 1 (227) and Period 2 (284) show a significant jump above the training baseline, indicating a strong upward trend. 3. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The current date (2019/2/25) coincides with the transition into Spring. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this product is highly relevant for Spring workwear transitions and early seasonal shopping. 4. Trend Analysis: There is a clear week-on-week increase of ~25% from Period 1 to Period 2. The shift from a ~170 baseline to the mid-200s suggests entering a high-season regime. 5. Forecast Logic: I expect the upward momentum to continue as Spring approaches, but at a slightly stabilizing rate. Forecasting a moderate increase over Period 2.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training demand averaged 173 units. In the first three test periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25), demand shifted significantly higher, averaging 236 units, which represents a ~36% increase over the baseline. This aligns with the seasonal transition into spring, where demand for tailored items like the Mariette Blazer typically rises as professionals refresh their wardrobes for the new season. While Period 2 saw a peak of 284, Period 3 corrected down to 198. As we enter the first week of March, a slight upward trend from the Period 3 dip is expected as spring retail momentum builds, though it is unlikely to return immediately to the Period 2 peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Feb 2019: Average demand increased from ~173 to ~236 (+36%) coinciding with the spring season transition for women's tailoring.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for this SKU averaged around 173 units. Since the transition to the Spring season (February 2019), demand has shifted to a higher regime with an average of approximately 231 units over the last four periods (227, 284, 198, 214). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is highly relevant for the March 'Spring/Workwear' shopping season in women's tailoring. Recent demand (Periods 3 and 4) has stabilized around 200-215 units following a late February peak. Given the date (March 11) is prime transitional season and the demand regime remains elevated compared to historical levels, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase as the spring season progresses.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the training period averaged 173 units. Since the transition to the spring season in February (Period 1 of test phase), demand has shifted to a higher level. The last three periods (Periods 3, 4, and 5) show relative stability with an average of approximately 209 units, while the peak in Period 2 (284) appears to be an outlier or a temporary surge. As of March 18th, we are in the peak window for Spring 'Womens Tailoring' demand. Given the consistency of the last three observations (198, 214, 215), I expect demand to remain stable around the current 210-220 range, reflecting the sustained higher regime identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (Periods -5 to -1) averaged 173 units. Since the transition to the spring season in February (Period 1), demand has shifted to a higher regime. Over the last 6 periods, demand has averaged approximately 225.5 units (227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215). Specifically, the last three periods (Periods 4, 5, and 6) have shown remarkable stability, holding steady at 214-215 units. Given the date (March 25), we are in the peak of the spring tailoring season, and the current trend indicates a plateau in the low 210s. I expect this stable demand to continue into Period 7.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed category) showed an initial surge in February (Avg: 236), likely driven by the start of the spring professional/event season. Recent demand in the test phase (Periods 4-7) shows a stabilization and slight cooling: demand was consistent at 215 units for two periods but dropped to 186 units in the most recent period (Period 7). The current date is April 1st. While spring demand for blazers usually remains healthy, the immediate trend is slightly downward from the February peaks. I expect demand to hover around the support level established in recent weeks, likely slightly lower than the 215 average as the initial spring shopping surge plateaus before any pre-Easter or mid-spring boosts.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows an initial training average of 173 units, which shifted upward in the test phase (Periods 1-8) to an average of 223.5 units. The Carry-over Insight noted a regime shift to ~236, but more recent data shows some fluctuation (low of 186 in Period 7, bounce back to 249 in Period 8). The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, which is highly relevant for April (Spring office wear and event season). Period 8 (April 1st) showed a significant jump to 249 units. Given the mid-Spring timing (April 8th), demand typically remains strong or increases slightly before settling. I expect demand to remain elevated, balancing the recent peak of 249 with the 8-period mean.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The demand for the Mariette Blazer shows moderate volatility, fluctuating between 178 and 284 units since the spring transition. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The current date is April 15, 2019. This period includes the week leading into Easter (April 21), a time typically associated with increased demand for 'Dressed' and 'Womens Tailoring' categories as consumers shop for holiday events. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand dropped to 178 in Period 9, following a spike of 249 in Period 8. The average over the last 9 periods is approximately 218 units. (4) Forecast logic: Expecting a seasonal uptick due to Easter preparations, I will forecast slightly above the recent average but below the previous peak, centering the prediction around the 225-235 range.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173, while recent test periods (P1-P8) averaged approximately 223 units, confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. However, the last two periods (P9: 178, P10: 130) show a significant sharp decline. Period 10 (April 15-21) falls during the lead-up to Easter 2019 (April 21); the drop to 130 suggests a pre-holiday slump or a cooling of the early spring surge for structured tailoring as the season progresses. April 22 is Easter Monday, a public holiday in many regions, which typically reduces commercial activity at the start of the week. Given the downward trajectory from 249 -> 178 -> 130, I expect demand to remain low or slightly stabilize as the holiday concludes. I am forecasting 138 units, reflecting a slight stabilization after the sharp drop but maintaining the recent downward momentum.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged ~173. The test phase initially showed a higher average (Periods 1-6 avg 237), but demand has significantly cooled recently. Specifically, Periods 10 and 11 show a sharp decline to 130 and 127 units, likely due to a post-Easter lull or a shift away from heavier 'Womens Tailoring' as late spring temperatures rise. Given the current date is April 29th, we are entering the transition to summer. The recent 3-period trend (178, 130, 127) suggests a new lower baseline. I will forecast a slight stabilization near the recent floor, accounting for a minor end-of-month or seasonal variation, but maintaining the downward trajectory from the early spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime confirmed starting Period 9 (April): Demand shifted from a high-spring average of ~230 to a late-spring average of ~128 (-44%), likely due to seasonal product relevance fading.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this women's blazer showed a high-demand regime in February and March (Avg: ~223). A downward trend was identified starting in April (Period 9), with demand dropping to an average of ~128 units between Periods 10 and 11. However, Period 12 (April 29) saw a significant rebound to 191 units. This spike is likely attributed to early May bank holiday shopping or preparations for mid-spring events (e.g., graduations or weddings) common in early May. Given the current date of May 6, we are moving past the holiday peak but remain within a moderately active period for light tailoring before the summer trough. The forecast weights the recent rebound at 191 while acknowledging the broader seasonal decline observed in April, targeting a stabilization point slightly above the recent lows.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this women's blazer showed a peak in early spring (Periods 1-8 average: ~223) followed by a notable decline as the season progressed. Periods 10 and 11 saw a drop to ~$128. However, recent data shows a recovery in late April and early May: Period 12 spiked to 191 (likely due to pre-summer events or promotions) and Period 13 settled at 160. The current date (May 13) is mid-May, where formal/office wear remains relevant but is transitioning into the summer lull. The average of the last four periods (10-13) is ~152. Given the trend of stabilization higher than the April lows but lower than the March peaks, I expect demand to remain moderate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a spring season peak followed by a dip in April (Periods 10-11: avg ~128). However, recent performance in May shows a moderate recovery and stabilization. Periods 12 through 14 recorded demands of 191, 160, and 196, respectively, reflecting a three-period average of approximately 182. This suggests that while the initial high-spring peak has passed, late-May demand for tailored blazers remains resilient, likely driven by vocational or occasion-wear needs. Given the recent upward volatility (196 in Period 14), the forecast weights the most recent three weeks more heavily while projecting a slight normalization towards the recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Following an April dip, demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~182 (+42% vs previous valley) over the last 3 periods (P12-P14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed) has shown significant volatility. After a confirmed dip in April (Periods 10-11), demand stabilized into a 'recovery regime' between Periods 12-14 with an average of ~182. However, the most recent observation (Period 15: 143) shows a sharp decline from the previous week's 196. Looking at the logic: (1) The carry-over insight suggests a stable mean around 182, but the actual data for the last 4 weeks (P12-15) are 191, 160, 196, 143, averaging 172.5. (2) There is a noticeable 'sawtooth' pattern (up and down every other week) that has persisted for the last 5 periods. (3) The current date (May 27) transitions into June; typically, demand for heavy tailored blazers may begin to soften as summer weather arrives, or see a small boost from 'office-wear' or graduation events. Given the recent drop to 143 and the overall fluctuating trend, I expect a slight mean-reversion toward the current 4-week average, but moderated by the recent downward move.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical pattern summary: The product experienced a high-demand phase in early spring (P1-P8 avg ~236) followed by a dip in April (P9-P11 avg ~145). Seasonal/calendar considerations: We are currently in early June (2019/6/3). In the fashion cycle, 'Womens Tailoring' like jackets often sees a secondary stabilization or mild decline as summer heat sets in, though office-wear maintains a baseline. Recent trend analysis: Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has fluctuated between 143 and 196, with an average of approximately 172. The last two periods (143 and 168) show a slight softening compared to the 190+ peaks. Forecast logic: Given the average of the most recent 'stabilized' regime (~172) and the slight downward movement in the most recent two weeks as we enter summer, I expect demand to remain near the recent average but slightly lower than the P16 level.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' (Period 1-17) shows distinct seasonal phases. After a high-spring average (P1-P8: ~223) and a late-April dip, demand stabilized in May (P12-P16) with an average of ~172 units. However, Period 17 (June 3) shows a sharp drop to 118 units. This decline matches expected seasonal behavior for women's tailored blazers as summer temperatures peak and professional wardrobes transition away from heavier lined garments. Given the date is June 10, the immediate trend is downward. Weighting the last 3 periods (143, 168, 118) gives a moving average of 143, but the most recent drop suggests a shift into a lower summer regime. The forecast accounts for this downward momentum while respecting the previous stabilization floor.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a high-demand period in early spring (avg ~223) followed by a seasonal dip in April. Demand recovered in May to an average of ~182. However, with the onset of June (P17-P18), demand has entered a new downward phase, averaging ~128.5. This aligns with seasonal expectations for a heavier 'woven fabric' blazer as summer temperatures rise, reducing the need for tailored outerwear. The most recent data points (118 and 139) suggest a stabilization at a lower level compared to the May recovery phase. Forecast for P19 anticipates demand to remain in this lower summer range, slightly higher than the P17 valley but lower than the May average.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand shift confirmed in June: Demand has decreased from a May average of ~182 to a June average (P15-P18) of ~142 (-22%), reflecting seasonal decline for Blazers in the summer months.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer showed a peak in early spring (P1-P8 avg ~224) followed by a seasonal decline as summer approached. May saw a brief stabilization (~178), but June has displayed a consistent downward shift. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) have averaged approximately 126 units (118, 139, and 122 respectively), which is a step down from the early-June average of 155. Given the product's character as a fitted, lined blazer, demand typically remains suppressed during the peak summer weeks of late June and July. I expect Period 20 to continue this lower-demand trend, settling near the recent three-week average.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal decline as temperatures rise into the summer months. The Carry-over insight from Period 19 identified a downward shift to a June average of ~142. Recent data shows a further degradation: Period 19 (122) and Period 20 (73). The drop to 73 units in Period 20 represents a significant departure from the previous June average, suggesting a transition into a 'Low Summer' regime. Given the date is July 1st, demand for a fitted woven blazer is at its seasonal nadir. I expect demand to remain low, potentially stabilizing near the recent low point as the product enters its clearance or off-season phase.

Carry-over insight: Low-summer demand regime shift confirmed: Starting late June (P20), demand dropped to 73 units, significantly below the previous June average of 142 (-48%), marking the end of peak seasonal relevance.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' (a dressed, fitted jacket) shows strong seasonal sensitivity. A significant decline was noted in the second half of June (Period 20: 73 units), which is typical for heavy tailoring as summer temperatures peak. However, Period 21 (July 1st) showed a recovery to 116 units, likely driven by mid-summer sales or early 'back-to-work' interest. While demand is lower than the spring peak (avg ~180-230), it appears to be stabilizing in a new summer range. Given the transition further into July, demand is expected to remain relatively stable but at this lower summer baseline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted woven blazer showed a peak in early spring (P1-P8 avg ~225) followed by a gradual seasonal decline. After a significant drop in late June (P20: 73 units), demand has stabilized over the last two weeks in early July (P21: 116, P22: 120), averaging 118 units. This indicates that while the product is in a low-summer demand phase compared to spring, the extreme low seen in P20 was a temporary trough rather than a sustained plateau. Given the stability between P21 and P22 and the mid-July timing, I predict demand will remain consistent with this recent baseline as pre-autumn interest has not yet begun.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern: high demand in early spring (Feb-April avg ~220), a step down in late spring/early summer (May-mid June avg ~140), and a significant low-summer drop in late June (P20: 73 units). However, the last three periods (P21-P23) show a stabilization and slight recovery, with demand holding steady at [116, 120, 120], averaging 118.7. This indicates that the extreme low of period 20 was a brief trough, and the current demand regime has flattened out for the mid-to-late July period. Given the consistency of the last two weeks at 120 units and the lack of major upcoming retail events in late July to drive a surge, I forecast a continuation of this stable baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed in July: Following the late-June dip to 73, demand has stabilized at a new mean of ~119 (+63% vs trough) over periods 21-23.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a low-demand summer phase. Following a period of relative stability between Period 21 and Period 23 where demand averaged 119 units, Period 24 saw a significant drop to 63 units. This mirrors the volatility seen in Period 20 (73 units), which was then followed by a partial recovery. Given the current date (late July), we are at the trough of seasonal relevance for woven blazers before the 'back-to-work' transition in late August. The forecast anticipates that demand will remain at this lower threshold or see only a marginal recovery as the summer clearance period concludes, weighting the most recent observation of 63 heavily while acknowledging the floor established by previous dips.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer shows multiple regime shifts. A peak in spring (Feb-Apr) was followed by a stabilization in May and a significant decline as summer progressed. Carry-over insights previously identified a stabilization at ~119 units in July (P21-P23), but recent data shows a new downward shift. Period 24 saw a drop to 63, and Period 25 slightly recovered to 94. The average of the last two periods is 78.5. Given we are in early August (2019/8/5), demand for professional tailoring typically remains low during the peak summer vacation period before the 'Back to Office' uptick in late August/September. The recent trend (avg 78.5) suggests demand is lower than the previous July stabilization. I expect demand to remain in this lower range (approx 75-95) for the current period.

Carry-over insight: New downward shift confirmed late July: Demand dropped from a July average of ~119 to a late-summer average of ~79 (-33%) over periods 24-25, indicating a secondary summer low.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a seasonal low in July (Periods 20-25 average ~97 units). However, Period 26 (August 5) shows a significant spike to 146 units (+55% vs. previous July stable mean). This shift aligns with the typical 'Back to Business/School' retail cycle where demand for women's tailoring (blazers) begins to recover for the autumn season. While previous insights noted a downward shift at Period 26 based on Period 24-25, the actual demand in P26 contradicts a sustained low. Given the date (August 12) and the product type (Fitted jacket/Blazer), we expect the recovery trend to continue as consumers prepare for fall. The forecast weights the recent upward bounce (146) while remaining conservative against the high volatility seen in early August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer experienced several seasonal shifts, recently hitting a low in late July (P24-P25 avg: 79). However, a significant reversal has occurred in August: P26 (146) and P27 (301) show a sharp upward trend. This spike aligns with the 'Back to School' and 'Autumn/Pre-Fall' retail transition where womens tailoring and dressed blazers regain high relevance for professional and academic wardrobes. Given the momentum from 146 to 301 (+106% jump), demand is likely to remain elevated as we reach the peak of the late-August shopping period, though it may stabilize slightly after such a dramatic week-over-week doubling.

Carry-over insight: Early-Fall demand regime shift confirmed: Starting August (P26), demand surged from a summer low avg of ~79 to an avg of ~224 (+183%) over P26-P27, signaling the onset of the Autumn seasonal peak for tailoring.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-demand regime coinciding with the late-August transition into the Autumn season (Back-to-Office/Fall fashion). Historical demand surged from a late-summer average of 79 to a recent average of approximately 233 over periods 26-28 (146, 301, 251). While period 27 saw a peak of 301, period 28 showed a slight stabilization to 251. Given that August 26 represents a peak period for autumn tailoring purchases, the forecast anticipates demand will remain high but continue to stabilize around the current 2-week average of 276. I will forecast a value slightly below the P28 observation to account for the post-surge settling while remaining significantly above summer levels.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in August (Period 26), moving from a summer low of ~79 to a much higher average. Over the most recent three periods (P27-P29), the average demand has settled at 261 units, representing the Autumn peak for women's tailoring (Blazer). Period 27 saw a spike (301), followed by a gradual normalization (251, 231). The current date, September 2nd, marks the beginning of the academic and business season, which typically sustains high demand for tailored garments. Given the slight downward slope in the last three weeks from the peak (301 -> 251 -> 231), I expect demand to stabilize around the current mean of this active period while accounting for a minor continued softening from the initial August surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak stabilization: After an initial surge to 301 units (P27), demand has stabilized at a high-level mean of ~261 over the last three periods (P27-P29) as the season transitions into September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong seasonal recovery starting in August (Period 26), where demand for the Mariette Blazer surged from a summer low average of ~79 up to an Autumn peak. Specifically, the last four periods (P27-P30) show a high-level regime with demand values of 301, 251, 231, and 357. The current date (Sept 9) aligns with the peak 'Back to Office' and Autumn fashion season for women's tailoring. Period 30 saw a significant jump to 357, indicating growing momentum or a temporary peak. Given the stabilization mentioned in Carry-over insights (avg ~261) and the recent spike, I expect demand to remain elevated in the high 200s to low 300s range. Weighting the most recent spike appropriately while accounting for the established Autumn peak mean, a forecast near the upper end of the recent average is logical.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for September: Avg demand for P27-P30 has increased to ~285, representing a clearly defined Autumn seasonal peak for tailored jackets.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a strong seasonal peak in autumn. Carry-over insights and recent data confirm a significant regime shift starting in mid-August (P26), where demand surged from sub-100 levels to an average of ~285 (P27-P30). Most recently, the first two periods of September (P30 and P31) have recorded the highest levels yet at 357 and 328 respectively. This indicates that we are currently in the peak of the autumn tailoring season. While P31 showed a slight cooling from the P30 spike, demand remains very high. Given the consistency of the 'Autumn peak stabilization' and the fact that mid-September is a prime window for workwear and seasonal transitions, I expect demand to remain in the 300-340 range. Weighting the average of the last two peak periods (342.5) against the slightly lower P31, a forecast of 334 is selected to reflect sustained high demand.

The demand significantly transitioned from a summer average of ~79 (P24-P25) to a high-demand September regime. Over the most recent three periods (P30-P32), demand has stabilized at an average of 342 units (357, 328, 341). As we are currently in late September, a key period for women's tailoring and workwear, demand is expected to remain high and consistent with this established peak. Given the stability of the last three observations around the 330-350 range, the forecast maintains this level.

Carry-over insight: September peak stability confirmed: Demand has maintained a high-level mean of ~342 units over periods 30-32 (+20% vs the early-August surge mean of ~285), representing the full maturity of the Autumn retail season for tailoring.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a strong seasonal peak for the Mariette Blazer during the transition into autumn. Following an initial surge in August (avg ~230-300), demand reached a high-level stability in early-to-mid September averaging ~342 units. However, Period 33 (Sept 23) saw a massive spike to 612 units. This represents an 80% jump from the previous weeks' average. While September is a peak month for tailoring, such a sharp increase often indicates a specific event (e.g., a major promotion, paycheck cycle, or pre-October seasonal shift). Given the end of the month (Sept 30) often reflects a slight cooldown after a spike or remains elevated due to sustained interest, but 612 is an outlier compared to the 300-level baseline. I forecast a correction back toward the high-level mean while acknowledging the increased momentum.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand spike in late September: Period 33 demand (612 units) increased by 80% over the previous 3-week average (~342), indicating a high-level volatility or promotion-driven peak at the end of the Autumn retail cycle.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows that the Autumn season for the Mariette Blazer peaked in September, maintaining a high-level mean of approximately 342 units (Periods 30-32). Period 33 experienced a significant promotion-driven spike to 612 units, followed by a correction in Period 34 to 313 units. Period 34's value of 313 is slightly below the pre-spike average of 342 but aligns with the established high-demand regime for tailoring in early October. As the season transitions further into Autumn, demand is expected to remain relatively stable or begin a very gradual descent from its peak levels. Therefore, the forecast for Period 35 anticipates demand consistent with the post-spike stabilization observed in Period 34.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant Autumn seasonal peak for the Mariette Blazer, starting in August (P26) and reaching a high-level maturity in September (P30-P32 average: ~342). Period 33 exhibited an outlier spike to 612 units, likely driven by a late-September promotion or event. Following this spike, demand in the last two weeks (P34: 313, P35: 283) has returned to the pre-spike baseline but shows a slight downward trajectory (9.5% week-over-week decline). For Period 36 (mid-October), tailored jackets typically begin a gradual seasonal decline as weather cools further and the market shifts toward heavier outerwear. The forecast predicts a continued gentle regression toward a mid-to-late Autumn baseline, slightly below the early-October average.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak Autumn decline confirmed: Following the September high (avg ~342, excluding spike), demand has entered a downward trajectory in October (P34-P35 avg ~298), marking the transition away from peak blazer season toward heavier winter apparel.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal cycle for the Mariette Blazer, with an Autumn peak in September (mean ~342 units, discounting the P33 outlier of 612) followed by a cooling trend in October. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has averaged 292 units, with the most recent two weeks showing stabilization at 283 and 282 units respectively. This represents a -15% shift from the September peak. As of October 21st, the demand is expected to continue this slight downward trajectory or maintain stability at this lower plateau as consumer interest transitions toward heavier winter layers. Therefore, I forecast a slight decrease to 275 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal cycle. After a significant Autumn peak in September (averaging ~342 units, with a spike to 612), demand has transitioned into a late-autumn stabilization phase in October. The average demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) is approximately 298 units (313, 283, 282, 313), showing a consistent level of interest as consumers continue to purchase dressed tailoring for the office and mid-season layering. The current date (Oct 28) precedes the typical November transition where demand often shifts again toward winter apparel or holiday promotions. Recent demand remains resilient, indicating that the 'post-peak' decline noted in Period 36 has leveled off into a high-plateau around 300 units.

Carry-over insight: Mid-Autumn stabilization confirmed: Following the September peak, demand has stabilized at a mean of ~298 units over the last four periods (P34-P37), a -13% shift from the September non-spike average of ~342.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailored blazer shows a distinct seasonal pattern, peaking in September (averaging ~342, with a spike to 612) and then stabilizing at a slightly lower level in October (~298 units). However, the most recent observation (P38: 385 units) shows a significant 23% increase above the October average. This uptick aligns with the start of November (2019/11/04), which typically sees increased retail activity due to pre-holiday shopping and seasonal transitions. Given the baseline stability around 300 and the recent upward momentum, the forecast anticipates demand will remain elevated compared to the October average, though likely slightly lower than the P38 peak as the initial November surge settles.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear transition from the Autumn peak (September/October average ~300-340) into a late-Autumn decline as the weather cools. Demand in Period 39 (231 units) dropped 40% from the previous period (385 units) and is significantly lower than the October stabilization mean of ~298. Moving into mid-November, the 'Mariette Blazer' (a woven, fitted jacket) typically sees reduced relevance compared to heavier winter outerwear. Recent data suggests a downward regime shift is underway. I expect demand to continue this downward trajectory or stabilize at this lower November level, likely hovering around the 200-220 range before the holiday shopping season influences patterns.

Carry-over insight: Late-Autumn downward shift confirmed: Demand has dropped from a mid-Autumn stabilization mean of ~298 (P34-P37) to an early November average of 231 (P39), a decline of ~22% as seasonal relevance for lightweight tailoring fades.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern shows an Autumn peak in September followed by a stabilization/slight decline in October (avg ~298), transitioning into a lower-demand late-Autumn regime in November. (2) Seasonal context: Current date is November 18; interest in lightweight blazers traditionally declines further as winter approaches. Period 38 saw a terminal spike (385), but P39-P40 have averaged ~254. (3) Recent trend analysis: Demand dropped significantly in P39 (231) and recovered slightly in P40 (278), indicating high variance but a downward shift in the mean compared to October. (4) Final forecast logic: Weighting the recent two-week average (~254) while accounting for the seasonal slowdown into late November, I expect demand to moderate slightly below the P40 level.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear transition from its September Autumn peak (avg ~342) into a lower late-Autumn demand regime. In November, demand has transitioned to a lower level: Period 39 (231), Period 40 (278), and Period 41 (245). This averages out to approximately 251 units for the November period. The current date is November 25, 2019, which falls during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail week. While this product is a 'Dressed' tailoring item (usually less influenced by extreme doorbuster events than basics), a significant seasonal lift is historically expected in the fashion retail sector during this week. Given the recent baseline of ~251 units, I anticipate a modest holiday pulse, forecasting a demand increase to approximately 275 units as shoppers capitalize on seasonal discounts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has recently entered the peak holiday shopping season. In Period 42 (Nov 25th), we observed a massive spike to 733 units, which coincides with Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events. Historically, this product saw a stabilization mean of ~298 in mid-Autumn and a drop to ~250 in early November. However, the move from 245 (P41) to 733 (P42) represents a nearly 200% increase driven by the peak promotional week. As the date moves to December 2nd (Period 43), we expect demand to retreat significantly from the Black Friday extreme but remain elevated above the pre-promotion baseline of ~250 due to Christmas shopping and potential extension of Cyber Week. A correction toward the 300-400 range is likely as the 'artificial' promotional peak subsides while general seasonal interest remains for a 'dressed' tailoring item.

Carry-over insight: Holiday promotional spike: Demand increased from a baseline of ~250 to 733 (+193%) during the Black Friday week of Period 42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a massive spike in Period 42 (733 units), which corresponds to Black Friday week, as noted in the Carry-Over Insights. Period 43 (169 units) represents the subsequent post-promotion 'hangover'\u2014a significant drop-off that is common as demand is pulled forward and consumers wait for the next gift-giving peak. Historically, before this spike, the late-Autumn regime (P39-P41) averaged approximately 251 units. Given that we are now in the second week of December (P44), demand typically remains at a lower baseline but begins to stabilize as part of the lead-up to the winter holidays. I expect demand to recover partially from the P43 trough toward the pre-promotion average, but remain below it due to the blazer's reduced seasonal relevance in mid-winter. A forecast near 185 accounts for this stabilization and gradual recovery toward the seasonal baseline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer peaked in September (~342 units) and established a late-autumn baseline of approximately 250 units in November. Period 42 showed a massive promotional spike (733 units) for Black Friday, followed by an expected post-promotion dip in Period 43 (169 units). Period 44 saw a recovery to 304 units, which aligns with the pre-holiday shopping window in early December. For Period 45 (week of Dec 16), demand is expected to remain relatively stable as shoppers finalize holiday outfits, though it may begin a slight seasonal tapering compared to the initial December bounce. I am forecasting a demand of 280, consistent with the pre-Black Friday mean and recent recovery levels.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the Mariette Blazer underwent several seasonal shifts: an Autumn peak in September (avg ~342), followed by a decline to a late-autumn baseline of ~251 units (P39-P41). Period 42 saw a massive Black Friday spike (733), followed by a typical post-promotion dip (169) and a pre-Christmas recovery (P44-P45 avg ~281). Period 46 (2019/12/23) covers the Christmas week. Typically, retail demand for dressed tailoring softens during the actual holiday week as shopping shifts from apparel to gifting/leisure and stores face holiday closures. Given the trend from P44 (304) to P45 (258), I anticipate a further seasonal reduction for P46 back toward the late-autumn baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a year-end trough following the holiday peak. After the Black Friday spike (P42: 733) and mid-December holiday shopping (avg P44-P45: ~281), demand dropped significantly in Period 46 (128 units), representing the Christmas week lull. Period 47 (2019/12/30) covers the New Year transition. Retail demand typically remains depressed immediately following Christmas, though it often experiences a slight lift from New Year's Eve activity or post-holiday clearance compared to the Christmas week floor. Based on the jump from the P46 low but staying well below the late-autumn baseline of ~231, I forecast a slight recovery as the market transitions toward the January clearance period.
