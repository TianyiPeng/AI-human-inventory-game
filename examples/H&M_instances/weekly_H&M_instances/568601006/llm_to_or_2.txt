Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for the Mariette Blazer, a women's tailored jacket. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no historical lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (which defaults to the promised 4 periods). Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging 173.4. Given the item is a blazer (often part of spring/autumn transitions) and the date is February 11th, we might anticipate a seasonal uptick as spring collections arrive, but since we are just starting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level. This will set mu_hat to (1+4) * 173.4 = 867. The OR backend will compute the base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1), effectively managing the replenishment risk over the 4-period lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/02/18). Looking at the product history, '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) has an initial stockout situation. Demand in Period 1 was 227 units, while on-hand inventory was 0. A shipment of 207 units was ordered in Period 1 and is currently in-transit with a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Given the product category (Womens Tailoring/Blazers) and the February date, we are heading into the Spring season where demand for blazers typically remains steady or increases. Historical demand samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227] show an upward trend, with the most recent sample (227) significantly higher than the previous mean (~173). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this recent acceleration in demand while maintaining some stability. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). The target base stock should be around 1000-1100 units to avoid further stockouts. By setting L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N (N=5), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5), the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the recent elevated demand levels.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demand (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) showed an average of ~173. Recent observed demand in Period 1 (227) and Period 2 (284) indicates a significant upward trend, likely due to the arrival of the spring fashion season in late February. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because orders are still in transit (Promised L=4). Period 1 order (207 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Demand has increased by roughly 50% compared to historical averages. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture this shift while still maintaining a reasonable sample size. Promised lead time remains at 4, and no arrival data is yet available to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: demand increased from historical avg ~173 to ~255 (+47%) coincident with late February/Spring season.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Mariette Blazer' is a women's tailoring item, highly relevant for the spring season starting in mid-February. Historical demand reflects a baseline of ~173, but recent demand (P1: 227, P2: 284, P3: 198) confirms a higher demand regime (avg ~236). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 729 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, the first order placed in Period 1 (207 units) should arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Currently, we are experiencing lost sales due to zero stock. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture the current spring demand levels, and L will stay at default as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a drift in lead time. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the volatility of the new regime.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, entering the peak spring season. Looking at history, we have zero inventory on-hand and have sold 0 units because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. An order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Thus, seeing 'arrived=0' in Periods 1-4 is expected behavior. The demand since Period 1 has averaged 230.75 (227, 284, 198, 214), which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical average (~173). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will maintain the default promised lead time L=4 as we have no evidence yet of a deviation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's blazer, which is in high demand during the spring season. Historical demand (recent 5 periods) since the season start is [227, 284, 198, 214, 215], giving a mean of ~227.6. The carry-over insight correctly identified this regime shift from the pre-game average of ~173. The promised lead time is 4. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4), as confirmed by the Period 5 conclude message. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand (215) exceeded supply (207) in Period 5. Pipeline inventory is high (1018 units), consisting of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. With a lead time of 4, the order from Period 2 (236 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 6 and be visible at the start of Period 7. To stabilize the OR backend, I will use recently observed demand (N=5) to reflect the spring season regime and stick with the promised lead time (L=4) as it was confirmed by the first arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Seasonal demand regime (Spring) stabilized at mean ~228 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (March 25th). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which is entering its peak Spring season. Historical demand for the last 6 periods averages 225.5 units, significantly higher than the initial pre-game average of 173. The last three periods show high consistency: 214, 215, 215. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). Currently, on-hand is low (21 units) while in-transit is high (965 units). The orders from P3 (286), P4 (309), P5 (187), and P6 (183) are still in the pipeline. We expect the P3 order to arrive during Period 7 resolution. To handle the sustained demand shift while accounting for the high transit volume, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current seasonal demand mean (~226) and variance. Lead time is set to default (4). The backend will calculate base stock for 5 periods (L+1) and subtract the large pipeline, preventing excessive over-ordering while maintaining our position for the Spring trend.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring item. Demand since Period 1 has shifted from a historical average of 173 to a current 'Spring' regime average of approximately 219 units per period (Avg of P1-P7: (227+284+198+214+215+215+186)/7 = 219.8). The demand is stabilizing as the peak early-season rush (Feb/March) transitions into April. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7. Currently, we have 121 units on-hand and 878 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The order from P4 (309 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of the current Period 8. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized Spring demand (mean ~205 for the last 5 periods) rather than including the initial Feb spikes. With L=4, the base stock will target coverage for 5 periods of demand (Period 8 through 12).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (April 8th). The product is a Women's Blazer, which is seasonally relevant for Spring. History confirms the lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). The demand regime changed significantly at the start of the simulation (Period 1), jumping from a pre-game average of ~173 to a live game average of ~224 (calculated over Periods 1-8). Over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), the mean demand is 212.4 with a standard deviation of 23.4. Given the seasonal nature of a 'Mariette Blazer' in April, demand is likely to remain stable or slightly increase before the summer drop-off. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the full live-game demand profile, which provides a more robust estimate of the spring regime than the pre-game samples. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, L='default' is appropriate. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 ensures the OR backend uses only the demand observed during this active spring season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) continues in its Spring season regime. Demand across the last 9 periods (post-history) has averaged ~218 units, compared to the initial historical mean of ~173. Recent demand (P1-P9) includes: 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186, 249, 178. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). Inventory is now well-stocked with 190 on-hand and 711 in-transit. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this stabilized 'Spring' demand regime while smoothing out the volatility seen in the early February spikes. Sigma_hat will also use N=9 to reflect the current variance. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's fitted blazer (Mariette Blazer), typical for Spring office/formal wear. Current period is Late April. Looking at demand history since Period 1 (excluding initial low historical samples), the mean is approximately 209.6 units (calculated across P1-P10). However, there is a visible downward trend over the last three weeks: P8=249, P9=178, P10=130. This suggests the peak Spring demand for blazers may be cooling off as we enter late April/May. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P5 arrived P9, P6 arrived P10). On-hand inventory is healthy at 243, with a significant pipeline of 781 units (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10 totaling 199+54+275+253 = 781). I will set L to 'default' (4). For demand (mu_hat), moving from the higher historical average toward the recent lower readings, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the recent deceleration while maintaining enough coverage for the 5-period cycle (L+1). Sigma_hat will use recent_N=10 to integrate the higher volatility seen in earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak Spring deceleration: Demand slowed from ~228 (P1-P8) to ~154 (P9-P10). Pipeline is nearly full (~781 units).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April). The product is a women's blazer, which shows clear seasonality. Demand peaked between Period 1 and 8 (avg ~224) and has decelerated significantly in the last three periods (P9: 178, P10: 130, P11: 127), averaging ~145. This matches the post-Easter/late spring cooling for tailoring items. Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently heavy with 595 units in transit plus 315 on-hand, while demand is dropping. I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this lower demand regime (~145/period). This will help prevent over-ordering as we enter the warmer months when blazer demand typically softens further.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: Period 9-11 demand dropped to avg 145/period (-35% from spring peak).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6) shows the Mariette Blazer experiencing a post-Spring demand deceleration. While the seasonal peak (Feb-Mar) averaged ~228 units, demand over the last four periods (P9-P12) has cooled to an average of 156.5 units (178, 130, 127, 191). The most recent demand (191) was higher than the previous two periods, but remains well below the peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 178 and in-transit at 541 (Total = 719), we have approximately 4.6 periods of cover based on the current regime average (~155). Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0, the OR engine needs to avoid over-ordering during this deceleration. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift to a lower, more volatile post-peak demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower post-Spring average: Periods 9-12 average demand is ~157 units, compared to ~228 units in early Spring peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', which typically sees peak demand in early spring (Feb-April) for the work/occasion season. Recent demand data (Periods 9-13: 178, 130, 127, 191, 160) confirms an average of ~157 units, a significant deceleration from the earlier spring peak of ~228 units. We are now in mid-May, past the primary spring shopping peak. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 293 and 392 units in-transit (total pipeline 685), and an expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1=5) of approximately 785 units (157 * 5), we are adequately stocked. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering as the season winds down.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', which typically sees peak demand in early spring (office/smart-casual attire) and tapers off as summer approaches. We are currently in late May (Period 15). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following the March/April peak. Across the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand averaged 163.7 units. The most recent demand (P14) was 196, but the overall trend since P9 supports a lower baseline than the early spring peak of ~228. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the remaining spring/summer tail. Pipeline (294) and On-hand (350) totals 644, which is roughly 4 periods of the current average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring piece. Current date is May 27, 2019. Historically, demand peaked in February-March (approx. 228 units/period) and decelerated starting in April. The recent demand (Periods 9-15) has averaged 160.7 units/period, showing some stabilization after the initial drop. Last period's demand (P15) was 143. Pipeline reconciliation: Periods 9-12 arrivals were consistent with lead time L=4. In-transit units (494) consist of orders from P12 (0), P13 (126), P14 (155), and P15 (213). Since P11 arrived on P15, P12 is due on P16 (0 units), and P13 is due on P17. On-hand is healthy at 220 units. I will set the demand regime to look at the recent 7 periods (P9-P15) to capture the post-peak average demand (~161) while accounting for the lower volatility compared to the high-growth spring phase. Setting L to default (4) as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Post-Spring demand regime (Period 9-15) stabilized at an average of 161 units per period, down from the 228 peak in early Spring.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3rd), the Mariette Blazer is in a post-Spring demand regime. Historical demand from Period 9 to 16 has averaged approximately 163 units per period (178, 130, 127, 191, 160, 196, 143, 168), significantly lower than the early Spring peak of ~228. Period 16 concluded with 0 arrivals because the Period 12 order quantity was 0, confirming the expected delivery timeline based on the L=4 lead time. On-hand inventory is low (52), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial at 638 units (Orders from P13-P16: 126+155+213+144). These arrivals will sufficiently cover the next 4 periods of demand (~163 * 4 = 652). I will set mu_hat to reflect this stabilized post-Spring demand regime using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture the trend since early April, and keep lead time at the default promised value of 4, which has been consistently observed. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10. The product is a Mariette Blazer, which saw a peak in demand during the spring (Periods 1-8 avg: ~224) and has since decelerated into a summer regime. In the last 9 periods (P9-P17), the average demand has been 156.7 units. The most recent demand (P17) was 118, the lowest in several weeks, confirming a cooling trend as we move further into June. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Note: Period 16 conclude shows arrived=0, but this likely corresponds to the order from Period 12 which was for 0 units; thus, no shipment loss is suspected. The pipeline (in-transit) is 680 units, which is quite high relative to current demand. I will set L to 'calculate' (which returns 4) and use the recent 9-period window (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spring deceleration while ignoring the very early spring peak. This provides a mu_hat based on an average demand of ~157 per period, preventing further over-ordering while the high pipeline resolves.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Period 9-17): average demand stabilized at ~157 units, a significantly lower level than the Spring peak of ~224.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a fitted jacket, which has seen a demand deceleration following the Spring peak. Demand has stabilized at a lower Summer regime. Analyzing periods 9 through 18, the average demand is approximately 149 units per period, with recent volatility showing a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P17, and P18). Note that the order from Period 12 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival message in Period 16, which is consistent with the lead time. I will set the lead time to its promised value of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (covering the stabilized regime desde P9 to P18) to provide the OR backend with the most relevant demand statistics for the current lower-demand environment, preventing over-ordering based on the high Spring peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 9-18 average demand is ~149 units per period, reflecting a sustained Summer level (~33% lower than Spring peak).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a stable Summer demand regime. Looking at the history from Period 9 (Late April) to Period 19 (late June), the demand has consistently stayed below the Spring peak (~225), averaging approximately 149 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P9 to P18). The most recent demand in Period 19 was 122 units, maintaining this lower trend. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate (confirmed by arrivals in P17, P18, and P19). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-spring regime, setting L to default (4). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover 5 periods (L+1) of this lower-intensity demand while maintaining the required service level (80% based on profit=4/holding=1).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P9-P19) confirmed stable: mean demand ~147 units per period, consistently ~35% lower than the Spring peak (~225). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the 'Mariette Blazer' is in a stable Summer demand regime. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 20 is approximately 144 units per period, with the most recent sample (P20) showing a dip to 73. This lower volatility and volume compared to the Spring peak (avg ~225) suggests maintaining a tighter inventory profile to minimize holding costs. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand (238) plus in-transit (489) totals 727 units\u2014covering approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand (144 * 5 = 720)\u2014I will set mu_hat based on the stable Summer regime (N=12, covering P9-P20) to ensure the backend OR logic maintains this baseline. Sigma_hat will also use N=12 to reflect current demand variability and avoid over-ordering based on older Spring volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained Summer demand regime confirmed (P9-P20): mean demand stabilized at ~144 units per period (approx. 36% decrease from Spring peak). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, well into the Summer season. Demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' (a professional/dressed fitted jacket) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the Spring peak. The demand regime from Period 9 to Period 21 shows an average of approximately 142 units per period, with recent weeks (P18-P21) being even lower (Avg: 112.5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. Currently, there is 290 units on-hand and 388 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 678), which covers nearly 5-6 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the post-Spring regime at Period 9) to accurately reflect the lower Summer demand and prevent over-stocking during this slow period.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P9-P21) remains stable but noticeably lower than Spring, averaging ~142 units/period. The most recent 4-week average (P18-P21) has dipped further to ~113 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a sustained Summer demand decline as of mid-July (Period 23). Historical demand for the late spring/early summer period (P9-P22) has averaged ~143 units, but a more recent 5-period window (P18-P22) shows a further drop to an average of ~114 units (139, 122, 73, 116, 120). This likely signifies the tapering off of blazer demand during peak summer months. Current on-hand inventory is 268 units and in-transit is 393 units (from P19-P22 orders). Total pipeline inventory (661) is quite high relative to recent demand. Demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) is expected to be lower. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this recent deceleration and prevent overstocking of a seasonal item. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer tapering: demand has further decelerated to an average of ~114 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P18-P22), down from the early-summer average of ~150.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is in a late Summer/pre-Autumn phase. Analysis of recent demand shows a stabilized but lower seasonal level. The last 6 periods (P18-P23) had demand values: 139, 122, 73, 116, 120, 120, averaging approximately 115 units per period. This is a significant drop from the early Summer average (~150) and the Spring peak (~225). I will use N=6 to capture this current demand regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 277 units on hand and 264 in transit (total 541), and an estimated (L+1) demand of 575 units (115 * 5), the system is well-stocked. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 will allow the OR backend to right-size the inventory for this lower-demand period while maintaining a safe service level for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime confirmed (P18-P23): mean demand stabilized at ~115 units per period, reflecting a final seasonal tapering before potential Autumn shifts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a Late Summer demand regime. Looking at the history, demand has significantly tapered from a Spring peak of ~228 units to a Late Summer average (Periods 18-24) of approximately 107 units per period. The last two recorded demand values (120, 63) show significant downward variance, with the most recent Period 24 demand (63) being the lowest observed since the game began. On-hand inventory is currently high (308 units) due to this deceleration, representing nearly 3 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the Late Summer shift from P18 onwards) to capture this lower mean (avg ~107) and its volatility. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime (P18-P24) confirmed: mean demand has decreased significantly to ~107 units per period, with a recent low of 63 in Period 24.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a sustained late-summer demand regime. Analysis of the history from Period 18 to Period 25 shows a significant deceleration compared to the early Spring peak. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P18-P25) is approximately 105.6 units, closely matching the 'recent_N' trend observed. The most recent demand was 94 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P21 order arriving in P25). With on-hand inventory at 281 and in-transit at 216, the total pipeline is 497 units, which is ample for the current demand level. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time stability and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this lower late-summer demand regime while maintaining some buffer against volatility. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime (P18-P25) stabilized at ~106 units/period, a ~30% decrease from the early Summer average (~150) and >50% decrease from the Spring peak (~225).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a late summer/pre-autumn transition phase. Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the Spring peak. Analyzing the most recent demand window (Period 18 to 26), the average demand is approximately 110 units per period. The last observed demand (Period 26) was 146, which is higher than the previous few weeks but still fits within the late summer volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the recent 9-period regime (P18-P26) where demand has averaged ~110. This results in a mu_hat of (1+4) * 110 = 550. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=9 period to reflect current volatility. With on-hand at 238 and in-transit at 196 (total 434), and considering the lead time, this setting will maintain a lean but safe inventory level as we approach the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime (P18-P26) stable at ~110 units/period, down from Spring peak (>200) and early Summer (~150). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we observed a massive demand spike to 301 units, which is nearly 3x the recent late-summer average of ~110. This is likely the start of a 'Back-to-School' or 'Pre-Autumn' demand surge for blazers (Womens Tailoring). My inventory was completely depleted (ending on-hand: 0). The in-transit pipeline is 353 units, consisting of orders from P24 (76), P25 (37), P26 (83), and P27 (157). Note that the P23 order was zero. Looking at lead times, P22 order arrived in P26 (L=4), but P23 (if any) and P24 orders are still in transit. P23 was 0, so the 'arrived=0' in P27 is expected. To respond to this regime shift, I will shift mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to the most recent 5 periods (P23-P27) to capture both the low trailing summer and the high P27 spike, preparing for a higher sustained demand level. I will maintain L=4 as the lead time remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Autumn regime shift detected: Demand spiked 170% in Period 27 (301 units) relative to late-summer average (~110). Strategy shifted to capture recent volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (mid-August), demand spiked sharply to 301 units, followed by 251 units in Period 28. This represents a significant shift from the late-summer average of ~110 units, likely driven by 'Back-to-School' or Autumn seasonal transitions for a blazer product. We are currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 for two periods), leading to lost sales. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P24 order arriving in P28). To capture this new higher-demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 samples (Periods 27 and 28) to reflect the new mean of ~276. This aggressive stance is necessary to rebuild inventory rapidly despite high holding costs, given the high demand signal.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School regime shift confirmed: demand increased from ~110 to ~276 (+150%) starting Period 27.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 27 (mid-August), coinciding with the typical 'Back-to-School' and early Autumn retail season. Demand spiked from a Late Summer average of ~110 units to an Autumn average of 261 units (P27: 301, P28: 251, P29: 231). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold out for 3 consecutive periods) despite arrivals, indicating that the OR backend's previous parameters were under-forecasting this new regime. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that reflect this higher sustained demand level to rebuild inventory. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand Autumn regime (P27-P29) and use the calculated lead time which remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime (P27-P29) stabilized at ~261 units/period, a 137% increase from the late Summer average (~110). Stockouts occurring due to rapid demand escalation.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is in a significant Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime shift that began in Period 27 (mid-August). Demand in the last four periods (P27-P30) has been 301, 251, 231, and 357, averaging ~285 units per period. This is an approximately 160% increase over the late-summer average (~110). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has experienced stockouts for the last four periods. Pipeline inventory is 1111 units, but recent arrivals have been small (37, 83 units) because they were ordered during the late-summer low-demand period. Large orders (157, 298, 335, 321) placed since P27 are still in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting L to 4 and mu_hat to 1425 (mean of 285 * (1+4)) using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility (std dev) observed during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand peak (P27-P30) confirmed: average demand increased to ~285 units/period (up 160% from late Summer). Significant stockouts occurring as pipeline catches up to new regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Autumn/Back-to-School season. Since Period 27, demand has shifted significantly upward, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging ~294 units per period (301, 251, 231, 357, 328). This is a 167% increase over the late Summer average (~110). We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) because the pipeline, although substantial (1332 units), is still catching up to this regime shift. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead plus review period (1+L = 5 periods) at this new high-demand level, mu_hat will be set using recent_N with N=5 to capture the full Autumn shift. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime (P27-P31) confirmed: mean demand increased further to ~294 units/period, a ~167% increase from late Summer (~110).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime for the 'Mariette Blazer' is firmly established, with demand consistently exceeding 300 units in recent periods (P30: 357, P31: 328, P32: 341). The current mean for this regime (P27-P32) is approximately 301.5 units per period. Despite significant arrivals (e.g., 298 units in P32), the system is still stock-out prone because demand is outpacing previous base stock calculations based on the transition phase. I will continue using recent_N (N=6) to capture this specific Autumn regime, centering the forecast on ~300 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 order arriving in P32). Pipeline inventory is significant (1269 units), but with demand at ~300/period and L=4, the requirement for (L+1) periods is approximately 1500 units, justifying the continued high order volume to eliminate stockouts and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P32) stabilized at ~300 units per period, a ~170% increase from late Summer levels. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1340.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing a severe Autumn demand surge, likely a combination of back-to-work seasonality and perhaps promotional activity. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 612 units, significantly above the previous Autumn average of ~300 (P27-P32). This indicates the 'Autumn regime' may have transitioned into a 'Peak Autumn' or 'Promotion' phase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 1268 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80%, but because we are currently stocking out and demand is accelerating, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the start of the Autumn shift in Period 27) to capture the higher mean and variance. This will help the base-stock calculation reach a level that supports both the current mean (~344 units since P27) and the high volatility observed in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand transitioned into a 'Peak' phase in Period 33: demand reached 612 units, doubling the already elevated Autumn average (~300). Cumulative average since the Autumn shift (P27-P33) is ~344 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1244.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' is currently in an Autumn peak phase. After a significant spike to 612 units in Period 33 (likely a specific promotion or the heart of the seasonal transition), demand in Period 34 returned to 313, which is consistent with the established Autumn regime average of ~300 (P27-P32 average was ~294). This confirms the demand shift from the late-summer low (~110) to a sustained higher level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is full (1501 units in-transit), and on-hand inventory is essentially depleted (8 units). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the sustained high demand while smoothing the recent outlier of 612, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat covering the Autumn shift (starting P27). N=8 covers Period 27-34. This provides a robust estimate for the current regime and ensures we don't over-order based on a single outlier while maintaining high service levels for the blazer's seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand regime (P27-P34) remains strong with a mean of ~340 units/period (including peak spike), representing a new baseline vs. early-summer (~150) or late-summer (~110).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-October/Autumn phase. Historical demand since the 'Autumn shift' (Period 27-35) shows a mean of approximately 346 units, though this includes a significant peak of 612 in Period 33. The most recent demand (Periods 34-35) has stabilized at around 298 units, suggesting the initial 'Back-to-School' surge has leveled off into a consistent Autumn baseline. On-hand inventory is 103, and the pipeline is very full (1544 units), including large orders from Period 32 (235), 33 (334), 34 (554), and 35 (421). Since L=4, the pipeline covers the next 5 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 9-period Autumn regime (N=9) to capture the overall higher demand volume while allowing the OR backend's cap mechanism to prevent over-ordering as the massive pipeline begins to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-School demand plateau: Following the Period 33 peak (612), demand for P34-P35 has stabilized at ~298 units, confirming a high-volume Autumn baseline (approx. 3x late-summer levels).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand Autumn/Back-to-School regime. Since the demand spike at Period 27, mean demand has stabilized at ~340 units per period (P27-P36). A major peak of 612 units occurred at Period 33, but the most recent 3 periods (P34-P36) show a more consistent average of ~293 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the entire Autumn regime (starting P27). Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to account for the heightened volatility (including the P33 spike) to ensure better service levels in the face of potential stockouts. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P27-P36) stabilized with a mean of ~340 units, though the most recent three periods (P34-P36) suggest a lower plateau of ~293 units. Pipeline is high (~1549 units) in response to carlier stockouts.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand Autumn regime (P27 onwards) following a significant season shift from summer. Demand reached a peak of 612 in P33 but has since stabilized into a plateau. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has been consistently between 282 and 313, with an average of approximately 298. The 'Autumn Regime' average including the peak is 340, but the recent stabilization suggests a forecast closer to 300 is more appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs as the pipeline catches up. In-transit inventory is high (1460 units) which covers nearly 5 periods of stabilized demand (L=4). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat (N=max(min(regime_length, 20), 3)) focuses on this current plateau (~298/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P37 conclusion message.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau confirmed (P34-P37): demand has stabilized at ~298 units/period following the P33 peak. This represents a high-volume baseline significantly above previous seasons.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume Autumn/Peak regime. Following the massive spike in Period 33 (612 units), demand has stabilized over the last five periods (P34-P38) with an average of approximately 315 units per period. The pipeline is currently very healthy (906 units in-transit + 246 on-hand), and the large arrival of 554 units in Period 38 successfully met demand and rebuilt safety stock. Given the current date (Nov 4), the high Autumn demand for a 'fitted jacket/blazer' is expected to remain firm or potentially taper slightly as we move toward winter, but it is unlikely to return to the low summer levels (~110) immediately. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) captures this stable post-peak plateau (avg ~315), ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) without over-ordering into a potential year-end slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume plateau (P34-P38) stabilized at ~315 units/period, down from the P33 peak of 612 but nearly 3x summer levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an Autumn high-volume plateau phase. Demand for the most recent 6 periods (P34-P39) has averaged 301 units per period [313, 283, 282, 313, 385, 231]. This is a stable baseline following the Period 33 peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 436 and In-transit at 870, the pipeline (1306) is currently sufficient to cover approximately 4.3 periods of demand at the 301-unit rate. Since the required stock level (Base Stock) should cover L+1 = 5 periods, and the current pipeline is slightly below that target against a volatile Autumn backdrop, I am maintaining parameters to reflect this 301-unit average. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-peak stability while excluding the extreme P33 outlier (612).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateau (P34-P39) stabilized at ~301 units/period, following the P33 peak. This represents the current high-season baseline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has stabilized into an Autumn high-season plateau. Since the peak in Period 33 (612 units), demand has leveled off. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the average demand is approximately 298 units, which is consistent with the 'Autumn demand plateau' noted in previous insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this specific plateau while excluding the massive P33 outlier. On-hand inventory is healthy (398), and a large pipeline (926) is in transit to cover the lead time. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a service level that supports this ~300 unit/period demand while being mindful of the 4:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio, which naturally targets an 80% service level.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the late Autumn/early Winter period for the Mariette Blazer. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: Period 27-32 saw a high Autumn plateau (~300 units), with a massive peak in Period 33 (612 units). Since Period 34, demand has decelerated slightly and stabilized into a new plateau. For the last 8 periods (P34-P41), the average demand is approximately 291 units. Comparing the most recent 4 periods (P38-P41), the average is slightly lower at 285 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (ending at P47), we must be careful not to over-order and incur high holding costs, especially as we approach the likely end of the high-season for a fitted jetted-pocket blazer. On-hand + In-transit (398 + 936 = 1334) currently covers 4.6 periods of demand at the 290-unit rate. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the post-peak plateau (avg ~291) while acknowledging the slight downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak Autumn plateau (P34-P41) stabilized at ~291 units/period, down from the P33 peak (612) but maintaining high volume through November.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a massive demand spike of 733 units, more than double the Autumn plateau (~291). This likely represents a Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak. However, the order from Period 38 (which would be 0 units based on historical high inventory) results in an arrival of 0 in Period 42 conclude, meaning we entered Period 42 with zero on-hand after satisfying only 398 of the 733 demand units. The current date is December 2nd, entering the Christmas/Holiday season. Given the recent stockout and the massive demand shift, I need to adjust mu_hat to account for this higher volatility and scale. The pipeline is at 1148 units, but we need to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to capture the late-year demand without excessive holding costs once the peak passes. I am using recent_N=9 (back to Period 34) to capture the high-volume Autumn/Winter regime while acknowledging the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Cyber Week demand spike detected in Period 42: demand jumped to 733 units from a plateau of ~291 (+150%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 is unfolding in early December, following the major demand spike observed in Period 42 (733 units), which corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Week. Demand in Period 43 dropped significantly to 169 units, which is expected post-cyber week but notably lower than the Autumn plateau of ~291 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P39 arrival in P43). Current pipeline is high (1357 units) due to aggressive ordering in response to stockouts during the peak. The objective now is to set parameters that recognize the likely end of the peak season while maintaining a sufficient buffer for potential holiday gift shopping in mid-December. I will use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat, which captures the Autumn plateau and the recent extreme volatility (avg ~300). This provides a conservative but robust demand estimate. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to account for the massive variance introduced by the 733-unit spike. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Cyber Week peak passed (P42 demand 733); demand in P43 (169) suggests a sharp deceleration or post-sale lull. High pipeline (1357) must be managed to avoid excessive holding costs in late December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (Dec 16) is approaching the end of the game (Period 47). We have just passed the Cyber Week peak (P42: 733) and a post-peak lull (P43: 169). Period 44 demand (304) has returned to the established autumn/winter plateau (approx. 300 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (P40 order arrived P44). With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), we must be extremely cautious with fresh orders to avoid high ending inventory and holding costs, as orders placed now will likely arrive in the very last period or after game end. Currently, on-hand (208) plus in-transit (1396) totals 1604 units, which is ample to cover the remaining periods at a mean of ~300. I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 (P34-P44) for mu_hat, which captures the stable high-volume plateau excluding the extreme P33/P42 spikes, providing a baseline of ~291 units. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-react to the Cyber Week spike while maintaining enough stock for the final stretch.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday stabilization: Following the Cyber Week spike (P42) and subsequent lull (P43), demand in P44 (304) has returned to the high-season plateau of ~300 units observed since October.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is in the post-holiday stabilization phase in late December (Period 46). Recent demand has returned to the high-volume Autumn/Winter plateau of approximately 290-300 units (Period 44: 304, Period 45: 258) after the Cyber Week spike in Period 42. Since the Autumn shift in Period 27, demand has averaged ~330 units, but the last 12 periods excluding the Cyber Week outlier average ~295 units. The pipeline is currently very high (1421 units in-transit + 205 on-hand) due to large orders placed during the stockout periods and around the holiday peak (orders in Periods 43-45 alone total 1209 units). With only 2 periods remaining (including the current decision period) and a lead time of 4, orders placed now will not arrive before the game ends. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage current status. I'll use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-season baseline (~295 units) while filtering out the singular Cyber Week spike to avoid over-ordering during the late-December deceleration. L is set to default (4), which remains consistent in historical arrivals.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on 2019/12/30, marking the end of the calendar year and the transition into the post-holiday January lull. Historical demand observations show that after the high-volume Autumn/Holiday plateau (approx. 300 units/period) and the Cyber Week spike (733 units in P42), demand has entered a deceleration phase typical of the post-holiday season. Specifically, demand in P43 was 169 and P46 was 128. The pipeline is currently very high (1430 units), mostly stemming from orders placed during the high-demand periods in November/December (P43-P46). Given lead time is stable at 4 periods, these units will arrive throughout January. To prevent excessive holding costs during the expected seasonal slowdown, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent 4 periods (avg ~214, influenced by the low P46) and setting lead time to default. This will allow the OR backend to naturally taper down orders as the pipeline is already more than sufficient to cover multiple weeks of current demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday/Winter deceleration confirmed: Demand in P46 dropped to 128 units, and the 4-period average (P43-P46) has fallen to ~214 units/period, down from the Autumn plateau of ~300 (-28%).
