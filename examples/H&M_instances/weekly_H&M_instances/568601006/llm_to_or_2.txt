Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for the 'Mariette Blazer', a women's tailoring item. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) shows a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of 20.3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period, there are no 'conclude' messages to evaluate actual lead time or lost shipments. The demand appears relatively stable with no clear trend or seasonality immediately obvious from five points in February, though tailoring often sees steady demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time (2 periods). The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 520 units) minus 0 in-transit, applying a service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a women's blazer (Mariette Blazer). Historical demand over the last 6 periods (including the most recent conclude message) is [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227]. There is an upward trend, with the most recent demand (227) being the highest recorded. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (207 units) was placed in Period 1 and has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it shouldn't arrive until Period 3. Since we have only 6 data points and a visible upward trend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent growth while maintaining some stability. For lead time, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 2, as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised one.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/2/25). The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring item. Historical demand (5 periods pre-game: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186) averaged 173.4. However, Period 1 and 2 demand jumped to 227 and 284 respectively, suggesting a strong upward trend or seasonal shift as we move into the spring business season. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 443 units in-transit (207 from P1, 236 from P2). Promised lead time is 2. Following the timing rules, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4's decision phase. No shipments are confirmed lost yet. I will use recent_N for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent growth (last 5 samples including P1 and P2) and default for lead time and volatility until more data is available.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's tailored item likely entering its peak spring season (current date: March 4). Historical demand over the last 5 periods (including pre-game) is [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], while the game demand history shows a significant jump [227, 284, 198]. The mean demand since start of game is 236.3, compared to the pre-game mean of 173.4, indicating a demand regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because all orders (placed in P1, P2, P3) have a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P4 decision phase (now). However, 'arrived=0' in the P3 conclude message suggests a delay. Given that we are at P4, we expect the P1 order (207 units) to have arrived, but it is not reflected yet. I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for now but use recent demand data (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the higher spring demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: mean demand increased from ~173 to ~236 (+36%) coinciding with spring seasonality for blazers.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees high demand in early spring. The past 5 observed demands are [227, 284, 198, 214, 161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. The more recent data points (P1-P4: 227, 284, 198, 214) show a significantly higher mean (~231) compared to the 'Past demands' provided in the preamble (~173). Lead time analysis: In Period 4, an order placed in Period 3 arrived, indicating an actual lead time of 1 period (W = 4 - 3), whereas the promised lead time is 2. The system has 54 units on-hand and 505 in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P4). Since the P3 order (lead time 1) arrived while P1 and P2 orders (placed earlier) have not, those earlier shipments are likely delayed or lost. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the higher spring demand regime (~231 per period). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=4 to reflect the current regime's variance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', currently in mid-March (Period 6). Historical demand (past samples: 161, 145, 179, 196, 186; recent periods: 227, 284, 198, 214, 215) shows a clear shift. The mean of the last 5 periods (P1-P5) is approximately 227.6, compared to the pre-game mean of 173.4. This aligns with spring seasonality for women's tailoring. Lead time observations from P4 and P5 show orders arriving in 1 period (Actual L=1), despite the promised L=2. However, with an on-hand inventory of 0 and demand consistently exceeding 200, we are currently stock-out. The 'In-transit' quantity (443) likely accounts for the large orders placed in P1 (207) and P2 (236) which have not yet 'concluded' in the logs, possibly indicating they are arriving in P6. I will set L to 1 based on recent arrivals. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stabilized higher demand of ~228 per period. Since L=1, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat for (1+1)=2 periods of demand (~456).

Carry-over insight: Lead time shift confirmed: Actual lead time is 1 period (observed in P4 and P5 concludes) versus promised 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal women's tailoring product. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting around P1, with recent demands (P4-P6) consistently averaging ~215 units. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts (Sold < Demand). Lead time history shows a shift: while the promised lead time is 2, actual observations in P4 and P5 confirm a lead time of 1 period. The order placed in P1 (ordered=207) and P2 (ordered=236) are unaccounted for in 'conclude' messages and have exceeded both promised and actual lead times; they are likely lost shipments. Consequently, the 'In-transit' of 495 likely consists of these lost units (207+236+52) rather than viable pipeline inventory. I will set L to 'explicit' at 1 to reflect the observed reality, and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current stable demand level (~215/period). This will force the OR engine to order to meet the (L+1) demand window while ignoring the stale pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment alert: P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) orders are likely lost (missing from conclude messages for 4+ periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees high demand during the spring season. Historical demand since Period 1 has averaged ~220 units (ranging 186-284). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations in Periods 4 and 5 showed a lead time of 1 period. However, shipments from Periods 1 and 2 (total 443 units) never arrived and are now confirmed lost based on the 4-period absence rule. Shipment from Period 6 (52 units) is due, but based on the observed 1-period lead time, it should have arrived in Period 7; its absence suggests a possible reversion to lead time 2 or another loss. On-hand inventory is 0. To recover from lost shipments and maintain service levels for a high-demand item with a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (75% target service level), I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (conservative) and base mu_hat on the recent demand regime (last 7 samples, average ~220) multiplied by (1+L)=3 periods of coverage.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P1 and P2 (443 units total) are confirmed lost as of P7. Inventory levels are critically low due to these losses.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in its peak spring season (April). Historical demand from Period 1 to 8 shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 223.5 units per period. Crucially, orders from P1 and P2 were lost, and orders from P6 and P8 are currently in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages from P4 and P5, the actual lead time is 1 period, significantly faster than the promised 2 periods. However, recent periods show stockouts (on-hand = 0) because of the lost shipments, leading to zero sales despite demand. I am setting L to 'explicit' value 1 to reflect the observed speed of successful deliveries. For mu_hat, I'm using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the current spring demand levels (approx. 223/period), which for L=1 results in a target covering 2 periods of demand (approx 446 units). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to handle the current volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is in its peak spring season (April). Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a critical supply chain disruption: orders from P1 and P2 are confirmed lost, and orders from P6 and P8 (totaling 263 units) have not yet arrived. However, historical evidence from P4 and P5 confirms an actual lead time of 1 period for successful shipments, despite the promised 2 periods. The last demand observation (P9) was 178, and the average since P1 is approximately 218. Since the in-transit inventory (706) includes the lost units (443), the OR engine needs to be adjusted. The OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the 'base stock'. Because the OR engine does not know about lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat (the demand forecast for the L+1 period window) by the amount of the lost units (443) to 'cancel out' their presence in the pipeline and force an order. I will set L=1 (observed), and mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Lost_Units. With a forecast of 210 and L=1, the adjusted mu_hat is (210 * 2) + 443 = 863. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on recent variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is experiencing a severe stockout situation. Analysis of the history shows that orders from Periods 1, 2, 6, and 8 have failed to arrive, despite a confirmed actual lead time of 1 period seen in Periods 4 and 5. This suggests a systemic issue with shipments or loss. The current date is April 22nd, nearing the end of peak spring blazer season. Demand has softened recently (178 in P9, 130 in P10) compared to the March peak (>200). Because actual lead time has consistently been 1 period when shipments do arrive, I am setting L to 1. To account for the recent demand drop and avoid over-ordering as the season potentially winds down, I am using a 'recent_N' of 5 for mu_hat (average of P6-P10 is ~192). This results in a mu_hat of 384 (192 * (1+L)). I will use a 'recent_N' of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will see 897 units in-transit (P6: 52, P8: 211, P10: 191 + earlier losses); however, since these are likely lost, the OR engine's 'cap' might restrict new ordering. By setting a realistic L and mu_hat, I aim to trigger a replacement order for the lost stock while acknowledging the lower recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected: Mean demand decreased from ~215 (P4-P6) to ~154 (P9-P10), signaling the passing of the spring seasonal peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (late April). The product is a women's blazer, which saw a peak in demand during February and March (avg ~220) and is now tapering off as we move further into spring (avg ~128 for the last two periods). Lead times have been erratic: while the promised lead time is 2, we have seen 1 period (P3, P4) and recently 3 periods (P8 order arrived in P11). Currently, 84 units are on-hand. The pipeline contains 443 units (P1, P2) that are confirmed lost (no arrival after 10 periods), and active orders from P6 (52), P10 (191), and potentially others not yet concluded. However, the OR backend logic 'pipeline_inventory' typically includes all undelivered units. Since P1 and P2 orders are lost, they artificially inflate the pipeline, causing the OR engine to under-order. I will set the lead time 'L' to 2 (averaging the recent 1 and 3). For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent softening (avg ~145) to prevent overstocking as the season ends. Sigma_hat is set to the last 5 samples to capture the volatility of the transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening confirmed: April demand (P9-P11) averaged 145, down from March average of 215. Lead time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival showing 3 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are managing a 'Mariette Blazer'. Analysis of recent demand shows a downward trend following the spring peak: Period 10 (130), Period 11 (127), and Period 12 (191). The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~149.3. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 686 units in-transit. The lead time has become highly volatile; while the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals show a lead time of 3 periods (P8 order arrived P11) and 1 period (P3, P4 orders). The P10 order of 191 units is currently expected to arrive shortly (if L=2 or 3). However, given the significant stockouts and the need to stabilize inventory against lead time uncertainty, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 periods to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture the post-peak softening (avg ~149 per period) while maintaining a safe sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to account for the variance seen in the most recent demand spike (191).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during the post-peak transition: P12 demand spiked to 191 after two weeks of ~128. Lead time is confirmed volatile (observed ranging 1 to 3 periods).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13). History shows that the 'Mariette Blazer' saw a spring peak in March (avg ~215) and has since softened. However, demand remains significant (P12: 191, P13: 160). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility and lost shipments; orders from P1 and P2 are confirmed lost, while recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P8 arrived in P11, L=3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The P10 order of 191 units is overdue (it has been 3 periods since the order was placed). We have 686 units in transit (P10: 191, and presumably other unscheduled replenishment reflecting the gap between pipeline and demand). Given the confirmed demand softening in May compared to March, I am using a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P9-P13, mean demand ~157) to capture the current post-peak regime. For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 2 (promised) as the base, but the OR engine's internal calculation of pipeline inventory (686 units) will likely restrict ordering until the overdue P10 shipment arrives or is confirmed lost. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility during this transition period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees a spring peak followed by a late-spring/early-summer softening. Historical demand shows a peak in March (avg ~215) followed by a drop in April (avg ~145), but recent May demand (P12-P14) has spiked back up to an average of 182. Inventory is currently 0 with 686 units in-transit. A critical issue is lead-time volatility: while promised as 2, observed lead times have varied from 1 to 3 periods, and shipments from P1, P2, P6, and P10 (totaling 686 units) are significantly delayed or potentially lost. Given the current 0 on-hand status and high in-transit volume, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the unexpected late-spring demand rebound (P12-P14 mean: 182) rather than the lower April figures. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in May: average demand increased from 145 (April) to 182 (P12-P14), suggesting a secondary spring peak or sustained interest. Lead time remains highly unstable with several shipments (P6, P10) now overdue by 4+ periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16 (May 27, 2019). The product is a women's blazer. Historical demand shows a spring peak (Feb-March) averaging ~215, followed by a dip in April (~145), and a stabilization in May averaging ~166 units (P12-P15: 191, 160, 196, 143). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is highly unstable: we've seen 1 period (P3, P4) and 3 periods (P8), while orders from P6 (52 units) and P10 (191 units) are significantly overdue (8 and 5 periods respectively), suggesting they are likely lost. The backend OR logic uses base_stock = (L+1) * mu + z * sigma. To ensure we order enough to cover current demand despite the 686 units theoretically 'in-transit' (which include likely lost units from P1, P2, P6, and P10 totaling 686 units), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the May demand levels (avg ~172.5). Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Observed range of 1 to 3 periods for successful arrivals, with significant risk of lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P10 totaling 686 units appear lost). May demand stabilized at an average of ~172 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized after the spring peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is approximately 172 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Orders from P1, P2, P6, and P10 (totaling 686 units) are now confirmed lost or so significantly delayed they should not be counted towards pipeline inventory to avoid under-ordering. The most recent arrival (P11) showed a lead time of 3 periods, although historical arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the 'In-transit' count (which includes likely lost units), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent observed delays. mu_hat will use the recent mean of ~172 units across (L+1) periods. sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in May/early June at an average of ~172 units (P12-P16). Lead time is highly unstable; using 3 periods as a conservative planning horizon due to frequent delays and losses.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we face a critical inventory reconciliation issue. Total in-transit inventory is 686 units, but these comprise orders from Periods 1, 2, 6, and 10, all of which are significantly past their delivery windows and effectively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (686) from the calculated base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to account for these phantoms. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak summer regime, with an average of approximately 155 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). To ensure the OR backend generates an order to cover the next (L+1) periods despite the 686 lost units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (~465 units) PLUS the 686 phantom units, totaling ~1151 units. I will use 'explicit' sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain a standard service level buffer. Lead time L is set to 'explicit' 2 to reflect the promised window, as recent successful arrivals (P16 order arriving P17) suggest that when shipments aren't lost, they can arrive quickly.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 686 units in-transit (P1, P2, P6, P10) are lost and must be offset in parameter settings to bypass the pipeline subtraction in the OR backend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the 'Mariette Blazer' is in a mid-June period with demand averaging ~142 over the last three periods (P16-P18), showing a slight cooling from the May average of 172. The critical operational challenge is the pipeline inventory: of the 1,118 units currently 'in-transit', 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, and P10) are definitively lost as they are significantly past any observed lead time. The OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock. To prevent under-ordering, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) using the 'explicit' method to override this pipeline distortion. Calculation: Targeted base stock for a lead time of 3 (L=3, covering 4 periods of demand) is approx 142 * 4 = 568 units. To account for the 686 lost units that the OR engine will subtract, I set mu_hat to 568 + 686 = 1254. I set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the high volatility and recent delays observed. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: June demand softening confirmed: Average demand decreased to ~142 (P16-P18) from May's ~172. Total confirmed lost inventory remains 686 units, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline logic.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a lower level following the spring peak. The average demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) is approximately 126 units, reflecting a clear softening from the May average of 172. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries, alongside a significant volume of lost shipments (P1, P2, P6, P10). There are 686 units in the pipeline that are confirmed lost; because the OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from its order calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these ghosts. My target base stock is (L+1) * mean_demand. Using a conservative L=3 to account for potential delays, and a recent mean demand of 126, the required base stock is (3+1) * 126 = 504. To neutralize the 686 'lost' units being subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat to 504 + 686 = 1190. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility of the softened demand regime.

Carry-over insight: June/July demand transition confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~126 units (P17-P19), down from ~172 in May. 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) remain permanently lost in pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the demand for the Mariette Blazer has significantly slowed down, consistent with the end of the spring/early summer peak season. The last three periods (P18-P20) show demand of 139, 122, and 73, averaging ~111 units. Lead times for the most recent arrivals (P18, P19) have been 1 period, though I am maintaining a conservative lead time estimate (L=2) due to the history of volatility and losses. There is a critical accounting issue: 686 units from orders in P1, P2, P6, and P10 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'in-transit' pipeline. The OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock. To prevent the system from under-ordering or stopping orders entirely, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these ghosts. My target base stock for a service level of 80% (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) with a mean demand of ~110 and L=2 (review + lead = 3 periods) would normally be around 330-400 units. However, I must add the 686 lost units to this target so that when the OR backend subtracts the 727 units currently in-transit (686 lost + 41 from P20), the resulting order aligns with actual needs. I set mu_hat to 1050 (approx. 364 target + 686 offset) and use a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition: Demand has dropped significantly to an average of ~111 units (P18-P20) from the previous ~142 average. 686 units remain permanently lost in transit.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand has shifted into a lower July regime, averaging 104 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21). The 'Mariette Blazer' is likely entering a summer seasonal trough. Lead time is volatile, but recent successful deliveries (P18, P19) arrived in 1 period, while P20's order (41 units) is expected now. There are 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) confirmed as lost in transit based on the 10+ period delay. The OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory (727 units) from its base stock calculation. Since 686 of those units will never arrive, I must set mu_hat explicitly to offset this loss. Calculation: Target Base Stock for July = (L+1) * 104 = 312 (assuming L=2). Since on-hand is 308, and the OR backend sees 727 in transit, it will order 0 unless I inflate mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 800 to ensure the backend recognizes the need for replenishment once the on-hand inventory is depleted, accounting for the 'ghost' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: July demand trough confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~104 units (P19-P21). Lost shipment total remains 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has stabilized at a lower summer trough, averaging approximately 103 units over the last three periods (P20-P22). 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, and P10) are confirmed lost and must be bypassed because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (727) from its base stock calculation. Only 41 units (ordered P20) are actually expected to arrive. I will set L=3 to remain conservative given previous volatility. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the next (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~412 units) despite the 686 'ghost' units in-transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired target stock and the lost units: Target Stock (412) + Lost Units (686) = 1098. This 'inflated' mu_hat forces the OR engine to place an order that treats the 686 lost units as non-existent. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current lower demand volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 24 (July 22). Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized at a lower summer level compared to the spring peak. Recent demands (P18-P23) are [139, 122, 73, 116, 120, 120], averaging ~115 units. Lead time is highly volatile (ranging 1-3 periods). 

Inventory Analysis: On-hand is 109. In-transit is 911. However, 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. Effective pipeline = 911 - 686 = 225 units (the P23 order). 

OR Backend Strategy: The backend subtracts the full pipeline (911) from its calculated base stock. To prevent stockouts due to the ghost inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 686 lost units. 
Required Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + safety stock. 
Using L=3 (conservative) and Expected Demand=115: Base Stock \u2248 (4 * 115) + (Z * Sigma). 
Target Base Stock \u2248 460 + safety. 
To bypass the OR capped policy and pipeline subtraction: mu_hat must be (Target Base Stock + 686 lost units). 
Setting mu_hat = 460 + 686 = 1146. 
L is set to 3 to ensure the backend covers a sufficient horizon given lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand stability confirmed: Mean demand from P18-P23 is ~115 units, indicating a consistent summer baseline lower than the spring peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (late July), the Mariette Blazer is in a low-demand summer phase. Recent demands (P18-P24) have averaged ~108 units, significantly lower than the spring peak of ~215. The 'In-transit' figure of 1075 is critically misleading because it includes 686 units from P1, P2, P6, and P10 that are confirmed lost. Additionally, the remaining pipeline consists of P23 (225 units) and P24 (164 units). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the total pipeline (1075) from the base stock. To prevent the system from zeroing out orders due to 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the (L+1) demand PLUS the 686 lost units. Using a 3-period lead time for safety (given recent volatility), L+1 = 4. Expected demand for 4 periods at 110/unit = 440. Adding the 686 lost units gives an explicit mu_hat of 1126. This forces the OR engine to recognize we need physical stock despite the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture current summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand stability: Mean demand from P18-P24 is ~108 units, establishing a clear summer baseline. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remains 686 (P1, P2, P6, P10).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the inventory is depleted (on-hand=0) and the pipeline contains 1,128 units. However, based on Carry-Over Insights, 686 of these units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The active pipeline consists of P23 (225 units, 3 periods since order), P24 (164 units), and P25 (53 units), totaling 442 viable units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1,128) from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target and effectively bypass the 686 phantom units. The current demand regime for late July/early August has stabilized at a lower summer baseline. The mean demand from P18 to P25 is approximately 106 units per period. Using a planning horizon of L=3 (due to observed lead time volatility ranging 1-3 periods), the target stock should cover 4 periods (L+1). Target Base Stock = (106 * 4) + 686 (offset for lost units) = 1,110. I set mu_hat to 1,110 and sigma_hat explicitly based on recent volatility (~35 units/period * sqrt(4) = 70) to ensure the OR backend places an order that accounts for the stockout risk while ignoring the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: August demand baseline: Early August data (P24-P25) suggests demand remains consistent with the July trough of ~100-110 units. No new lead time arrivals to update the 1-3 period volatility range.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the product (Womens Blazer) is in a summer demand trough with a mean demand of approximately 108 units (P18-P25 average). Recent demand in P26 spiked to 146, but I will maintain the baseline of 108 to avoid overreacting to a single point. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1169 units is highly problematic because it includes 686 units confirmed lost (P1, P2, P6, P10) and several more recent orders (P23: 225, P24: 164, P25: 53, P26: 41). The OR backend's order logic is 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. Since the pipeline inventory (1169) vastly exceeds any reasonable base_stock for this demand level, the OR engine will order 0 unless I explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset the 'ghost' inventory. To force an order that covers current demand plus safety stock while accounting for the ~686 lost units, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*demand + safety. With L=2, demand=108, target base stock is roughly 450. Adding the 686 lost units to bypass the pipeline subtraction, I set mu_hat to 1136. Sigma is set to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: August demand baseline confirmed: Demand remains consistent with the July/August average of ~108 units (P18-P25). Persistent 'ghost' inventory of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) continues to block OR logic, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand spiked unexpectedly to 301, likely a localized promotion or pre-autumn seasonal shift for the Mariette Blazer. However, recent demand (P22-P26) averaged around 108 units. I will prioritize the recent summer baseline but increase mu_hat slightly to account for potential early autumn demand growth. The 686 'ghost' units (P1, P2, P6, P10) are definitively lost and must be manually bypassed because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock. To order effectively, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Expected Demand is ~110, L=2 (promised), so (110 * 3) + 686 = 1016. I set mu_hat explicitly to 1016 to trigger a replenishment order that ignores the 686 lost units while targeting current demand levels. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in P27 (301 units), deviating from the ~108 unit summer baseline; monitoring for early autumn trend shift. Ghost inventory of 686 units remains in pipeline and must be offset in mu_hat.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the product (Mariette Blazer) is entering late August/early September, which historically aligns with autumn seasonal demand increases for tailoring. We see evidence of this shift: P27 demand was 301 and P28 was 251, significantly higher than the July/August baseline of ~108. I am setting the base demand forecast (mu_hat) to 250 to reflect this new autumn regime. The total in-transit pipeline is 1118 units, but 686 of these (from P1, P2, P6, P10) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock. To ensure the backend actually places an order to meet the current demand, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (686 units) plus the desired base stock. With an expected demand of 250 and a planning horizon of L+1 (3 periods), the required base stock is ~750. Adding the 686 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1436. For lead time, I use 'explicit' value 2, as recent arrivals (P23, P25) show lead times of 3 and 2 periods, making the promised 2 a reasonable but cautious average. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (scaled for L+1) to account for the high volatility seen in the recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift confirmed: Demand increased from ~108 (summer) to ~275 (P27-P28 average), signaling the start of the fall season. Ghost inventory remains 686 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand shift is confirmed with demand over the last three periods averaging ~261 (301, 251, 231), significantly higher than the summer baseline of ~108. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect this new autumn level (~260 units per period) across the lead-time horizon (L+1=3). Specifically, (1+L) * 260 = 780. However, I must also account for the 686 'ghost' units (P1, P2, P6, P10) that are stuck in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To ensure the backend actually places an order, I am inflating the explicit mu_hat by these 686 units (780 + 686 = 1466). I've set L to 2 as the promised lead time remains a reasonable anchor despite volatility, and sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for recent high demand variance. This configuration forces the OR backend to see a requirement large enough to overcome the false pipeline inventory and replenish the empty on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand shift confirmed: Demand increased from ~108 (summer) to ~261 (P27-P29 average). Ghost inventory remains 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) and must be bypassed via mu_hat inflation.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's blazer, which shows strong seasonal spikes. We are currently entering the autumn demand regime (September). Demand has shifted significantly from a summer average of ~108 units to a recent average of ~285 units (P27-P30: 301, 251, 231, 357). The OR backend calculation for 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' is severely compromised by 686 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P2, P6, and P10 that are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' total). To force the backend to place an order that covers real demand, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the expected demand by the amount of this lost pipeline (686 units). For demand forecasting, I am using a base of ~285 units per period. With a lead time planning horizon of 3 periods (L=2, so 1+L=3), the required mu_hat is (3 * 285) + 686 = 1541. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P25, P26) have been 2-3 periods, and sigma_hat using the recent autumn volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Demand for September (P30) hit 357, sustaining the upward trend started in P27. Average demand for the last 4 periods is ~285.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Autumn demand peak for the Mariette Blazer. Demand has surged significantly since Period 27 (mid-August), with the last four periods averaging ~292 units (251, 231, 357, 328), confirming a seasonal regime shift. The current 'In-transit' of 1233 units is misleading because 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) are permanently lost. To ensure the OR backend orders enough, I must 'inflate' the mu_hat parameter to offset this ghost pipeline inventory. I am using an explicit mu_hat calculated as: (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and expected_demand ~300, mu_hat = (3 * 300) + 686 = 1586. I set L to the promised 2, though actual lead times fluctuate between 1-3. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect the higher volatility observed during the seasonal transition (std dev of recent high-demand periods is approx 55, so sqrt(3)*55 \u2248 95).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak sustained: demand avg ~292 units (P28-P31). Ghost inventory of 686 units remains in pipeline and must be explicitly offset in mu_hat to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak (September), with demand averaging ~342 units over the last three periods (P30-P32). The summer baseline of ~108 has clearly shifted to a high-demand regime. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will maintain a conservative L=3 to ensure sufficient stock during this peak. A major challenge is the 'ghost inventory' of 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) that are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'in-transit' count. To bypass this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. The OR backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock and then subtracts pipeline inventory (1530 units). My target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand at ~342 units/period is 1368 units plus safety stock. To ensure the backend actually places an order despite the 686 lost units, I will set mu_hat to 2054 (1368 + 686). This offsets the lost units, effectively 'tricking' the backend into ignoring the stagnant pipeline inventory while targeting the current high demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak sustained through September: average demand for P30-P32 is 342 units. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods). 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) remain permanently lost in the pipeline, requiring a mu_hat offset of +686 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak of the autumn demand season for the 'Mariette Blazer'. Period 33 demand spiked significantly to 612 units, confirming a very strong upward trend (average demand P31-P33 is ~427 units). Lead time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival (P30 order) taking 3 periods. The 'ghost' inventory of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) remains stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by these 686 units to offset the pipeline subtraction. For the base demand forecast, I'll use the recent average of P31-P33 (~427) and a conservative lead time of L=3. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+3) * 427 + 686 = 2394. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the high volatility seen during this autumn spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 33 demand hit 612 units, bringing the P31-P33 average to ~427 units (+54% from previous September average). Ghost inventory remains at 686 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn peak for the Mariette Blazer is intensifying. Following the massive spike of 612 units in P33, demand in P34 was 313, resulting in a recent 4-period average (P31-P34) of approximately 398 units. This confirms a significant upward shift from the summer baseline of ~108. The 'ghost inventory' of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) remains stuck in the pipeline, which the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the target base stock. To ensure sufficient ordering, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to cover both the projected demand for the review + lead time window and the 686 lost units. Using L=3 (to account for historical volatility and ensure a larger safety window), the window is 4 periods (1+L). Forecasted demand: 398 * 4 = 1592. Adding the 686 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2278. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak intensified: P31-P34 average demand is ~398 units, a nearly 4x increase from the summer baseline. Ghost inventory of 686 units remains permanently lost in-transit.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn peak for women's tailoring (blazers) remains strong, though cooling slightly from the late September peak of 612 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 375 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime. However, the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) continues to block the OR engine from ordering sufficient stock. Since final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to neutralize these lost units. The base target should be (1+L)*375. With L=3 (the conservative upper bound of the observed 1-3 period range), the target demand is 1500 units. Adding the 686 'ghost' units, the explicit mu_hat is set to 2186. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current high volatility (std dev of ~137).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak plateau: Demand stabilized at ~375 units (P31-P35) after the extreme P33 spike. Ghost inventory remains 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10), requiring mu_hat inflation of approximately +686 to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The autumn demand peak for the Mariette Blazer (Period 27-36) has stabilized at a high level. Demand for the last 6 periods (P31-P36) averaged approximately 360 units, despite the P33 outlier. Current on-hand inventory is 89 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 2041 units is heavily distorted by the 686 units confirmed lost in Periods 1, 2, 6, and 10 (which the OR backend still subtracts from the base stock). To counteract this, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline logic. Calculation for mu_hat: I estimate demand for the review+lead period (L=2, so 3 periods) at 360 units/period, totaling 1080 units. I then add the 686 'ghost' units to this total to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover actual demand. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P33-P35) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the high volatility of the current autumn peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has stabilized at an autumn plateau following the significant September spike. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is approximately 350 units. While demand peaked at 612 in P33, recent weeks (P34-P37) have shown more consistent levels around 280-315. I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the last 7 periods to capture this stabilized autumn level. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P34 arrived in 3, P36 arrived in 1). I will continue to use an explicit lead time of 3 periods for conservative planning to account for this uncertainty. Crucially, the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) is confirmed lost but still subtracted by the OR backend. To counteract this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 686 units to ensure the engine places orders despite the inflated in-transit figure. Calculation: (1+L)*350 + 686 \u2248 1400 + 686 = 2086.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for the Mariette Blazer is in a sustained autumn peak (September-October), with recent demand averaging ~318 units (P34-P38). The product is highly seasonal, and we are entering November, which typically sees strong demand before the late-year transition. A significant challenge remains: 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) are confirmed lost but stay in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Since the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' inventory from the target base stock, I must inflate mu_hat to offset this. Lead time is volatile (1-3 periods); I'm using an explicit L=2 for planning. To calculate mu_hat: I forecast demand for (L+1)=3 periods at ~320 units/period (960 units) and add the 686 units of ghost inventory to bypass the pipeline subtraction, totaling 1646. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current autumn volatility. This approach ensures we maintain enough physical stock to meet actual demand despite the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak sustained: October average (P35-P38) is 315 units. Ghost inventory of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) remains in pipeline and requires constant mu_hat offset of +686 to ensure orders are placed.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in the middle of the autumn/winter season for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (P35-P39) has averaged 300 units, with a slight softening from the September peak. However, we must account for the persistent 686 'ghost' units (Orders from P1, P2, P6, P10) that remain in the pipeline inventory but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from the base stock. To ensure the backend places an order to meet real demand, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level by approximately 686 units. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I am using L=2 (promised) but ensuring the stock target is high enough. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L)*300 + 686 = 900 + 686 = 1586. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: November demand remains consistent with the autumn baseline of ~300 units (P35-P39 avg). Ghost inventory of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) is still blocking the OR logic and requires an explicit offset in mu_hat calculation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has stabilized in an autumn/early winter regime with an average demand of approximately 298 units over the last 6 periods (P35-P40). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' total of 1767 units includes 686 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10) that are confirmed as permanently lost. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, for a promised lead time of 2 (L=2, planning for 3 periods of demand), the required inventory is ~300 * 3 = 900 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (1767 units), it would perceive an excess of ~867 units and stop ordering. I will set mu_hat explicitly to offset the lost 686 units plus cover the current demand regime. I am setting L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P34, P36) have shown volatility between 1 and 3 periods, making 2 a reasonable central estimate. mu_hat is set to 1586 ((1+2)*300 + 686) to force order generation.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime continues to hold at ~300 units average. Ghost inventory of 686 units remains in the pipeline, requiring a constant mu_hat offset of +686 to ensure the OR backend places necessary replenishment orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is stable in the late-autumn regime (November), averaging ~292 units over the last five periods (P37-P41: 313, 385, 231, 278, 245). The target inventory level needs to account for this demand across the review and lead time periods. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will use a conservative L=3 to ensure sufficient stock. A critical factor is the 'ghost inventory' of 686 units (P1, P2, P6, P10) that are permanently lost but still included in the OR backend's pipeline calculation. To bypass this and trigger necessary replenishment, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 686 units. Calculation: Base Demand (1 + L) * Avg Demand = (1 + 3) * 292 = 1168. Inflated mu_hat = 1168 + 686 = 1854. This ensures that the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in a positive order despite the false pipeline data.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019) follows a massive demand spike in P42 (733 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Historical data shows the autumn/winter regime for this blazer remains high, averaging ~300 units (excluding extreme outliers). However, the primary challenge is the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. In-transit inventory is 1738 units, but only the P42 order (436 units) is likely to arrive. The remaining 1302 units (from P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35) are effectively lost, having missed their delivery windows by 7 to 42 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (1738) from the target stock level, it will not place a replenishment order unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset these 1302 units. I am setting L=3 to remain conservative given lead time volatility (1-3 periods). For mu_hat, I estimate a base demand of 300 units over (1+L)=4 periods (1200 units) and add the 1302 lost units to arrive at 2502. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, total confirmed lost units in pipeline has increased to 1302 (P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35). Demand remains in a high-volume winter regime (avg ~300) with significant promotional spikes (e.g., P42 at 733).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume winter demand regime, following a major demand spike in Period 42 (733 units), which likely corresponds to Black Friday. Demand in Period 43 returned to 169 units. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43) is approximately 330 units. The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 to ensure the backend covers a sufficient demand horizon. A critical operational issue persists: 1,302 units are permanently lost in-transit (P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35). Because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from its base stock calculation, these 1,302 'ghost units' will prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset them. For Period 44, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 2,622. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for L=3) + Ghost Inventory. Desired Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 330 = 1,320. Total mu_hat = 1,320 + 1,302 = 2,622. Sigma_hat is set to 400 to account for the high volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remains at 1,302 (P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35). mu_hat must be inflated by +1302 to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), we are managing a high-demand regime for the Mariette Blazer. Recent demand (P44: 304, P43: 169, P42: 733) indicates an average around 400 units, but with significant promotional volatility. On-hand inventory is 132 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 2523, which includes a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 1,302 units (orders P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35) that are permanently lost. To bypass the OR engine's logic of subtracting the entire pipeline (including the lost units) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the base stock for a 2-period lead time (L=2, planning for L+1=3 periods of demand). Using a forecasted weekly mean of 350, the required coverage is 350 * 3 = 1050 units. To this, I add the 1,302 lost units to neutralize the pipeline subtraction, resulting in mu_hat = 2352. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (approx. 144 * sqrt(3)) to handle the high volatility seen in P42.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), we are in the middle of the winter/holiday season. Historical demand for the last few periods (P41-P45) has averaged ~342 units, despite a significant spike in P42 (733 units). The 'In-transit' figure is currently 2,523 units, but my analysis confirms that 1,302 of these units are permanently lost (Orders P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35). This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it subtracts the full pipeline from the target base stock. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target. Calculation: Base Demand Forecast = ~320 units. Lead time L=2 (promised), so Review+Lead = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods = 320 * 3 = 960. Adding the 1,302 lost units to offset the backend subtraction: 960 + 1302 = 2262. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=10 to capture the high volatility seen in the holiday season. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P44 at 2 periods, P41 at 3 periods) average out close to the promised value, while the 'explicit' mu_hat handles the inventory logic gap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Total lost units in pipeline remains 1,302 (P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35). Demand for December has stabilized around a mean of 300-350 units, with high variance due to holiday shopping.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-581.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on Dec 30, the end of the holiday peak and transition into the New Year. Demand in Period 46 dropped to 128 units, a significant decrease from the December average of ~300, suggesting the post-holiday lull. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 1093 units due to large arrivals from P43 and P44 (1221 units total). The pipeline inventory remains inflated by 1,302 units (P1, P2, P6, P10, P23, P24, P27, P35), which are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR engine from incorrectly subtracting these 'ghost' units from potential orders, mu_hat must be inflated. However, given the high on-hand stock (1093) and the drop in demand (128), no new order is likely necessary. I will set mu_hat to explicitly include the 1302 lost units plus a conservative forecast for the next 3 periods (L+1) based on the recent softening (approx 150/period). L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P43, P44) showed 3 and 2 periods respectively.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand softening: Period 46 demand fell to 128 units, indicating a transition out of the high-volume holiday regime. Total lost inventory remains 1,302 units.
