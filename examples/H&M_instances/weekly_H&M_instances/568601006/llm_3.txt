Blazers are versatile but often see steady demand as people update their professional wardrobes for spring. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] yield an average demand of 173.4 units per period. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is Period 1, there is no arrival history. Orders placed now arrive in Period 3. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: To avoid stockouts in Periods 1, 2, and 3, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~174 * 3 = 522 units. Given there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 522 units to establish a baseline inventory that covers the lead time plus the current period.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed P1) has not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the timeline: Order P1 (522 units) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P3's conclude message (read at P4 start). Order P2 (138 units) should arrive during P4. Total pipeline (In-transit) is 660. Given the rising demand (P2 was 284), I estimate P3-P5 demand will average ~300.

Per the rules, an order placed in P1 with LT=2 arrives in P(1+2)=3 and is visible in 'Period 3 conclude' at the start of Period 4.

This confirms an actual lead time of 1 period, despite the promised 2. Orders from P1 (522) and P2 (138) have not arrived by P7 and are over 4 periods late; they are considered lost. Currently, we have 40 units on-hand and 300 units in-transit (ordered in P6, expected to arrive during P7). Our target inventory should cover (L+1) periods of demand to account for P7 and P8.

Following a peak in early spring (P1-P6 avg ~225), demand has cooled as we enter mid-May (P10-P13 avg ~152), which is consistent with seasonal transitions in women's tailoring. Analysis of arrivals shows P1 (522), P2 (138), and P6 (300) are likely lost, as they are significantly beyond the observed lead times (which have varied between 1 and 3 periods). The current In-transit total is 1340 units, but after subtracting the 960 units likely lost (P1, P2, P6, P7), the 'live' pipeline consists of P10 (200) and P11 (180), totaling 380 units. P10 was ordered in Period 10 and, given the current 3-period lead time trend, is expected to arrive during Period 14 (visible in P15). With 42 units on hand and 380 reliable units in transit against a forecasted demand of ~150 units/period, the current pipeline covers approximately 2.8 periods of demand. No new order is placed this period to avoid overstocking as the season winds down and to allow the current pipeline to clear.",

(a) World Knowledge: Blazers are typically spring/autumn items; demand often cools as summer heat arrives in late May/June. (b) Demand Analysis: Recent periods (P10-P14) show an average demand of 160.8. (c) Lead Time: Historical arrivals show inconsistency. P7/P8/P9 arrived with 2-3 period lead times, but P1, P2, and P6 (660 units) are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 1340 includes P10 (200), P11 (180), and the likely lost units (660). Excluding the lost units, the reliable pipeline is 380 units (P10 and P11). (d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. Demand for P14 was 196, causing a stockout of 154 units. (e) Decision: We need to cover (L+1) periods. Assuming L=3 based on P7/P8 data, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (~640 units). On-hand + Reliable In-transit (380) = 380. Deficit = 260 units.

Subtracting this from the total In-transit of 2,880 leaves an effective pipeline of 1,220 units. These effective units are from P35 (400), P38 (300), P39 (300), and the current P40 order. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. On-hand inventory is 271. To maintain a safety stock for the late-November holiday demand (expected ~250-300 units/period) across a 3-period lead-time window, the target inventory position is ~900-1000 units. Current position (On-hand 271 + Effective In-Transit 600 from P38/P39) is 871. I will order 300 units to maintain the pipeline and prepare for holiday sales.",

We are currently in mid-November, approaching the holiday season where demand for 'Dressed' tailoring often remains strong. Regarding logistics, the 'In-transit' figure of 3180 is highly inflated by historically lost/indefinitely delayed shipments (1660 units confirmed lost: P1, P2, P6, P10, P11, P17, P27). Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is 1520 units. Orders from P35 (400 units), P38 (300 units), P39 (300 units), and P40 (300 units) are currently in transit, along with a possible late arrival from P36 or P34. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, I need to ensure the effective pipeline covers at least 3 periods of demand (~900 units). The current effective pipeline (1520 units) is robust, but given the stockout in P40 and the high demand regime, I will order 300 units to maintain a steady flow and mitigate further stockouts during the late November period.",
