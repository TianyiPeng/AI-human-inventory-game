Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a piece of women's tailoring. The date is February 11, 2019. Historically, demand for the last five weeks has been [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], showing a mean of 173.4 and a slight upward trend. Since it is mid-February, we are approaching the spring season when demand for blazers and business casual wear typically remains steady or increases. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. The promised lead time is 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent activity levels while smoothing out noise. For lead time (L), I will use the default promised lead time of 4 until actual delivery data is observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and faced a demand of 227 units (which were all lost sales). An order of 207 units was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 4 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive in Period 5. The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'), and the dates (Feb 11, Feb 18) suggest we are in the early spring fashion season. Historical demand data shows five samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] with a mean of 173.4. Period 1 demand of 227 is significantly higher than the training mean, suggesting a possible upward shift or seasonal trend. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am setting L to default (4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (incorporating the latest high demand point) to allow the OR engine to adapt to the higher volume. Since we have zero on-hand and high demand, the primary goal is to build up stock to capture sales while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. This product (Mariette Blazer) is a women's tailored garment, likely seeing increased demand as we approach spring-ready retail seasons. The historical demand (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) and recent observations (227 in P1, 284 in P2) show a significant and sustained upward trend. The average demand over the last 5 historical samples was ~173, but the last 2 periods averaged ~255 (+47%). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, despite 443 units being in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Given L=4, orders from P1-P2 are still in the pipeline (scheduled for P5 and P6). I am using \u2018recent_N\u2019 with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the upward momentum. L is set to 'default' as we have no evidence yet of lead-time deviation beyond the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from historical avg ~173 to ~255 (+47%) starting Period 1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's professional tailoring product. Historical demand (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) averaged ~173. Recent realization in periods 1-3 shows demands of 227, 284, and 198, averaging ~236. This confirms a demand regime shift likely related to spring seasonal retail demand for professional attire. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Given L=4, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 757 in-transit (P1-P3 orders). With an expected demand of ~236 per period, and L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (P4-P8). 5 * 236 = 1180. Cumulative in-transit is 757, suggesting the OR engine will order approximately 423 units this period. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift in both volume and volatility compared to the initial 5 samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which likely sees increased demand during the early spring season (February-March). Historical demand before the game was ~173, but demand over the first 4 periods has averaged ~230 (227, 284, 198, 214). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (207 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have a pipeline of 1,066 units (orders from P1-P4). Since the first order hasn't concluded yet, we maintain the default lead time. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the recent regime length is 4 periods (P1-P4), so we use N=4. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to capture the volatility of this higher-demand regime. This approach ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level that accounts for the current demand spike while we wait for the pipeline to start arriving.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product is a women's blazer, which is seasonally relevant for spring. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 5, we saw the first arrival (207 units ordered in Period 1), confirming the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods as promised. Demand remains consistent with the shift detected in Period 3; the last five periods of demand are [227, 284, 198, 214, 215], which averages 227.6. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 5 (215) exceeded the arrival (207). There are 1,018 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 captures the current regime's mean (227.6) and volatility. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock and place a stabilizing order to maintain the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime (P1-P5) average is ~228 units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Based on history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Orders from P1 and P2 arrived in P5 and P6 respectively). Starting from P1, the demand regime has shifted upward compared to historical pre-game data. The average demand across P1-P6 is approximately 225.5 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 21 units with 965 units in transit (expected arrivals in P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the lead time L=4 is stable and the demand regime since P1 is relatively consistent, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this updated demand profile for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand while utilizing the most relevant recent evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $595.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The product is a women's blazer (Womens Tailoring). Looking at the demand history since Period 1, we observe values: 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186. The average demand for these 7 periods is approximately 220 units per week. This is significantly higher than the initial historical average (~171 across 5 samples). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on deliveries from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. On-hand is 149 and In-transit is 850 (comprising orders from P4: 309, P5: 159, P6: 183, P7: 199). The next arrival should be P4's order (309 units) in Period 8's resolution phase. The current demand trend is stable around 220 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime while excluding the older, lower demand pre-game samples. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4-period lead time matches observations.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P1-P7) average stabilized at ~220 units/period, roughly 28% higher than pre-game historical mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its spring selling season (April). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as observed in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8), aligning with the promised lead time. The demand regime started in Period 1 and has consistently averaged 223.5 units per period (N=8: [227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215, 186, 249]). This is significantly higher than the initial history of ~173. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this sustained higher demand level while ignoring the pre-game history. The on-hand inventory (209) plus in-transit stock (701) totals 910 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand, ensuring the OR backend maintains a steady pipeline without excessive holding costs given the $4/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost ratio.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-April 2019. The product is a women's blazer, a staple piece for spring professional and social wardrobes. Demand since Period 1 has averaged 218.4 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical average (~170). The most recent demand (Period 9) was 178, but volatility remains present (range 178-284). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P5). With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead). I will use recent_N=9 to capture the higher demand regime established since the start of the simulation, ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are tuned to the active spring season. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover expected demand over the next 5 periods while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in Period 11 (late April). Historically, demand since Period 1 has averaged ~210 units, significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 173. However, the last two periods (P9: 178, P10: 130) show a cooling trend compared to the earlier March peaks (avg ~220). This seasonality aligns with the tail end of the Spring tailoring season. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand is 243, with 781 in-transit (orders from P7-P10). Since demand is softening, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 6-10) to capture the recent decline in volume while maintaining a buffer. L is set to default as the promised 4-period lead time is performing as expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand for P1-P8 was ~220; P9-P10 average decreased to 154 units (-30%). Spring seasonality for tailoring may be peaking/declining.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a piece of women's tailoring. Current date is April 29, 2019. We are observing a sustained downward trend in demand as the spring tailoring season concludes. Demand for the last three periods (P9-P11) was 178, 130, and 127 units respectively, compared to the P1-P8 average of ~220. This indicates a regime shift to a lower demand level. On-hand inventory is currently high (315 units) and we have 600 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and declining demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods to reflect this lower regime (approx 145 units/period) and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture the current volatility of this lower demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Period 9-11 average is ~145 units, a 34% decrease from the previous regime (P1-P8 avg ~220).

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'Mariette Blazer' is entering early May (2019/05/06). Historical demand from Period 9-12 (April) has shown a clear downward shift compared to the early spring peak: [178, 130, 127, 191], yielding an average of ~156 units/period. The previous regime (P1-P8) averaged ~220 units. This decline matches a post-Easter/mid-spring tapering for heavier tailored jackets as temperatures rise. Currently, on-hand inventory is 284 units and in-transit is 440 units, totaling a pipeline inventory of 724. With L=4, the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate of 156, we need ~780 units to cover the cycle; we are currently near that level. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the softening demand trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the lower demand mean and volatility, ensuring we don't over-order into a seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed (Period 9 onwards): average demand dropped to ~156 units/period (-29% from P1-P8 avg of 220), likely due to seasonal transition out of early-spring tailoring.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14 (May 13). The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees peak demand in early spring (Feb-Apr) and softens as summer approaches. Demand history: P1-P8 averaged ~220 units/period. Starting P9, we observed a downshift: P9=178, P10=130, P11=127, P12=191, P13=160. The average of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 157.2 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 390 units on-hand and 295 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13 arriving in P14-P17), our pipeline is quite healthy compared to the forecasted demand of ~157/period. Setting L=4 (promised), mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a women's blazer. Analyzing the 'Period 9' onwards regime (6 data points), the average demand is approximately 163.7 units/period (178, 130, 127, 191, 160, 196). This is a clear downshift from the previous peak-spring average of ~220. Currently, on-hand inventory is 350 and in-transit is 294, totaling 644 units. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 5 periods * 163.7 = 818.5 units. The current pipeline (644) is slightly below this target. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the game (confirmed by arrivals in P13 and P14). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the current post-peak demand level and keep lead time at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 9-14) stabilized at avg ~164 units/period, down from peak-season avg of ~220.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27th, 2019. The product is a women's blazer, which typically sees a demand peak in early spring (Feb-Apr) and cools down as summer approaches. Carry-over insights and historical data confirm a regime downshift starting Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 15 is 156.4 units, significantly lower than the P1-P8 average of ~220 units. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods. Current inventory on-hand is 225, with a pipeline of 489 units. The pipeline consists of orders from P12 (0 units), P13 (121 units), P14 (155 units), and P15 (213 units). I will set L to 'default' (4) as lead times are stable. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand regime starting at Period 9 (156.4 units/period), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock of 782 units (5 * 156.4). This avoids over-ordering during the seasonal decline while protecting against the moderate volatility (std dev ~26) observed in this lower-demand phase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation reveals that the order from Period 12 (ordered 0 units) concluded as expected, with zero arrivals in Period 16. Period 17 (June 3) demand continues the post-peak trend for a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer. Demand has been relatively stable since Period 9 (8 periods). The average demand from Period 9 to Period 16 is 161.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (57), but in-transit (633) is very high relative to current demand needs due to higher orders placed in Periods 13-16 arriving soon. To prevent overstocking as we move into summer, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime while accommodating the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (Period 9-16) stabilized at avg ~162 units/period, consistent with seasonal decline in demand for structured blazers entering June.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a lower-demand regime as we move into June (avg ~160 units/period since Period 9). In Period 17, we received the shipment from Period 13, but the shipment from Period 12 (ordered 0 units) correctly resulted in arrived=0 in Period 16. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units with 680 units in-transit. The in-transit units consist of orders from P14 (155), P15 (213), P16 (144), and P17 (168). The P14 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 18 based on L=4. Since the demand has stabilized at a lower level (~162 avg for the last 9 periods), I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this seasonal 'post-peak' behavior while keeping L at the promised 4 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in a post-peak seasonal phase as we move into mid-June (P19, June 17). Demand from Period 9 to Period 18 has averaged ~155 units, compared to the early-spring peak (P1-P8) of ~220 units. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a further softening with an average of 141 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this post-spring regime (P9-P18 average) for mu_hat, as it reflects the current trend better than the full history. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P13 arrived P17, P14 arrived P18), so L=default. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of the current regime. Note: The P12 order (0 units) was a correct adjustment to high on-hand at the time, and the P15 order is due to arrive in P19 (current period), which will replenish the 76 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9-18 has averaged ~155 units/period, confirming a sustained 30% reduction from the early-spring peak (P1-P8 avg ~220). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a sustained lower-demand regime as we move further into June. Demand from Period 9 to Period 19 has averaged approximately 152 units per period, a 30% reduction from the earlier spring peak (avg ~220). This period (June 24) is likely entering a slower summer phase for women's tailored blazers. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, with only Period 12 showing a missing shipment (Period 12 ordered 0, so Period 16 correctly had 0 arrivals). Current on-hand (167) plus in-transit (539) is 706 units, which covers about 4.6 periods of current demand. I will set the mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 11 periods since the shift) and set L to calculate to stay aligned with the consistent 4-period lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9-19 stabilized at avg ~152 units/period, down from peak-season avg of ~220. This trend is consistent with summer seasonality for heavy tailoring.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a low-demand summer period (Date: 2019/7/1). Demand in Period 20 dropped to 73 units, the lowest recorded. The average demand for the current post-peak regime (starting Period 9) has been approximately 144 units, but the last 3 periods (18-20) averaged only 111 units, signaling a further seasonal slowdown as we enter July. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand (238) and in-transit (502) inventory, the total pipeline is 740 units, which covers over 5 periods of even the previous regime's demand (152). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this recent deceleration and prevent over-ordering during the summer lull. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. L remains at the promised default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softening in July: Periods 18-20 averaged ~111 units/period, down from the P9-P17 average of ~156 units/period (~29% decrease).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a clear seasonal decline as we move into July (summer). Demand has notably softened, with the last three periods (P19-P21) averaging approximately 104 units, compared to the spring peak of ~220 units and the early-post-peak average of ~160 units. Period 21 demand was 116 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high (290 units) relative to this newer, lower demand regime. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and in-transit inventory of 334 units (ordered in Periods 18-20), the pipeline is already substantial. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat, capturing the last month of decreasing demand (P18-P21: 139, 122, 73, 116; avg \u2248 112.5). This will result in a base stock level that prevents excessive overstocking during the summer trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime step-down in July: Period 19-21 average dropped to ~104 units/period, a ~35% decrease from the P9-P17 average of ~156 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as we move into mid-July. Since Period 19, the average demand has dropped to approximately 108 units per period (P19: 122, P20: 73, P21: 116, P22: 120), a further downshift from the late-spring average of ~155. With 268 units currently on-hand and 236 in-transit (a total of 504 units), our coverage is extremely high relative to current demand (L+1=5 periods). With a projected 5-period demand of ~540 units (108 * 5), our total inventory of 504 is nearly sufficient even without a new order this period. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the declining trend, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to capture the current July trough for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained July demand trough: Period 19-22 average demand is ~108 units/period, a 30% reduction from the Period 9-18 average (~155 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a sustained seasonal trough typical of mid-to-late July. Current period is July 22, 2019. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has averaged 110.2 units/period (values: 122, 73, 116, 120, 120), confirming the transition into a lower-demand summer regime compared to the early-spring peak (avg ~220) and the post-peak stability (avg ~162). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 277 units, and in-transit inventory is 186 units (total inventory 463). Given the current demand average (~110), the total inventory covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand. Since L=4, the pipeline is nearly full for the target base stock. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this summer trough and set sigma_hat using the same window to account for the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime. This conservative approach balances the risk of high holding costs ($1.0) against the moderate profit margin ($4.0).

Carry-over insight: July demand trough confirmed: Periods 19-23 average demand is ~110 units/period, a significant reduction from the Period 9-18 average (~155 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-69.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer continues to show a significant downward trend as we progress through July, which is seasonally consistent with lower demand for structured 'Dressed' tailoring. The most recent demand (Period 24) was 63 units, following a string of low values (116, 120, 120, 63). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 102 units, compared to the previous regime (P9-P18) of ~155 units. I will set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current July trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P20 order arriving in P24). With 321 units on hand and 207 in transit (P23: 79 units, P24: 128 units), the pipeline is likely sufficient given the current softening demand, but using recent_N will allow the OR backend to adjust our base stock targets down to protect against holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further decreased in July (P19-P24): avg ~102 units/period, a ~34% reduction from the P9-P18 average (~155 units).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing a sustained seasonal trough in mid-summer (July/August). For the period 19-25, demand has averaged approximately 101 units per period, a 35% decrease from the late-spring average of ~155 units. Current date is August 5th; demand remains low as we are between the spring/summer peak and the potential 'Back to School' or autumn tailoring ramp-up. The order from Period 21 (0 units) would have arrived this period (Period 26), and Period 22 (0 units) arrives in Period 27. On-hand inventory is 227 units with 242 units in transit (expected arrivals from Period 23, 24, and 25 orders). Total coverage is currently high relative to the low July demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this lower demand regime (avg ~101), maintaining L at the stabilized lead time of 4. This ensures we don't over-order before a clear autumn demand signals a shift.

Carry-over insight: July/August demand trough confirmed: Period 19-25 average demand is 101 units/period, down 35% from the Period 9-18 average (155 units).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (August 12). Demand for the Mariette Blazer has been in a documented trough since Period 19 (~July), with recent demand averaging around 101-110 units. However, Period 26 saw a jump to 146 units, potentially signaling the start of the 'Back to School' or 'Early Autumn' tailoring season. Historically, the 'July/August trough' (P19-P25) averaged ~101 units. Including P26, the recent 8-period average (P19-P26) is 106.75. Given the product is a fitted jacket, we anticipate a recovery from summer lows as we head into late August. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as seen in recent concludes, though P25 and P26 arrivals from P21/P22 were 0 units because those periods had orders of 0). Pipeline inventory is 326 and on-hand is 81. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the low summer baseline while allowing for the recent uptick, and use recent_N for sigma to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential end of July/August trough detected; Period 26 demand (146) is ~40% higher than the P19-P25 average (101).

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer surged to 301 units in Period 27 (up from the P19-P25 average of ~102), confirming that the July/August trough has ended and the late-summer/pre-fall tailoring season has begun. This spike led to a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). We are currently in Wait-and-See mode regarding Period 21 and Period 22 orders, which were 'ordered=0' and effectively represent gaps in the supply chain (confirmed by Period 25 and 26 arrivals being 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp demand increase, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect an expected baseline of 220 units per period (returning to the spring-peak level) to prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Pre-fall demand recovery confirmed: Period 27 demand (301) signifies the end of the July trough (~100 units/period) and a return to high-season baseline (~220 units/period).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has surged as of Period 27 (301 units) and Period 28 (251 units), aligning with the late-August transition into fall tailoring and back-to-work shopping. This confirms a recovery from the July/August trough (~100 units/period) back to or above the previous peak-regime levels (~220 units/period). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to back-to-back stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward shift and the need to aggressive restock to capture the fall season, I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the OR engine's forecast toward this new high-demand regime immediately. This will increase the base stock level to satisfy the anticipated ~250+ units per period demand while the pipeline replenishes.

Carry-over insight: Fall tailoring recovery confirmed: Period 27-28 demand averaged 276 units/period, surpassing the spring-peak average (~220) and signaling a strong seasonal shift upward from the summer trough (~100).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has fully transitioned into a high-season 'Fall recovery' regime. Recent demands for Periods 27-29 are 301, 251, and 231 (average ~261), which is a significant increase from the summer trough (~100) and even exceeds the spring peak (~220). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to this sudden spike, meaning the system is relying entirely on the pipeline. To capture this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the current high-demand state (~261 per period). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P25 arrived in P29), so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: High-season Fall demand confirmed: Periods 27-29 average 261 units/period, surpassing the spring peak (~220) and signaling a robust recovery from the summer trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a significant high-season fall recovery. Demand for the last four periods (P27-P30) was 301, 251, 231, and 357, averaging ~285 units/period. This is a sharp increase from the summer trough (~100 units/period) and even exceeds the spring peak (~220 units/period). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for the last 4 periods) because arrivals from the low-demand period (P23-P26 orders) are insufficient for this new regime. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods of the fall recovery (N=4) to capture the high average demand (~285 * (1+4) = 1425). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods as seen in the recent P30 conclusion (P26 order arrived in 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Fall tailoring high-season confirmed: Period 27-30 average demand intensified to ~285 units/period, surpassing the spring-peak average (~220) and triggering stockouts due to low summer-ordered influx.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a high-demand Fall peak. Demand since Period 27 has averaged ~294 units/period (301, 251, 231, 357, 328). This represents a massive recovery from the Summer trough (~100 units) and even exceeds the Spring peak (~220 units). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and is experiencing significant stockouts. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 31 concluding message). To address the current stockout and high demand, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the Fall recovery regime from Period 27-31). This will set mu_hat based on the average of ~294 units. Since we are in a stockout situation with high volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to ensure a high base stock level. The backend's base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) combined with the persistent stockout means the order will likely be constrained by the backend cap, but the goal is to pipeline enough units to meet this sustained Fall demand.

Carry-over insight: Fall tailoring high-season confirmed (Period 27+): Average demand increased to ~294 units/period, surpassing both summer trough (~100) and spring peak (~220). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-season Fall regime, with the most recent six periods (P27-P32) averaging approximately 301.5 units per period. This is a significant increase from both the summer trough (~100 units) and the spring peak (~220 units). Current demand is consistently exceeding 300 units, with Period 32 demand at 341. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With only 32 units on-hand and high demand expected, mu_hat and sigma_hat must be set based on this current Fall high-demand regime (N=6) to ensure the base stock levels (covering L+1 periods) are sufficient to meet the ~300+ units/period demand and prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock around (1+4)*300 = 1500 units, which correctly accounts for the pipeline of ~1194 units and the current inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand (P27-P32) confirmed: Average demand is ~302 units/period, a ~37% increase over the spring peak (~220) and a ~200% increase over the summer trough (~100).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Womens Tailoring Blazer) is currently in a massive Fall high-season peak. Period 33 demand reached 612 units, significantly higher than the previous P27-P32 average of ~302. While 612 might be an outlier or a specific fashion event peak, the overall trend since P27 is clearly elevated. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is 346 units. However, given the most recent data point (612) and the 'Fitted jacket' description during late September/early October (Autumn peak), I must account for high volatility and potential further acceleration. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent_N method with N=7 to capture the Fall regime average (346), but I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the extreme variance observed in Period 33 (where demand was nearly double the previous average), ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand has intensified significantly: P27-P33 average is 346 units/period, with a peak of 612 in Period 33. This represents a 57% increase over the Spring peak (~220).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1244.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Mariette Blazer' is in its peak Fall retail season (October). Current demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 27. The most recent demand (P27-P34) averages ~341 units/period, with a notable spike to 612 in Period 33. Period 34 demand returned to 313, suggesting the extreme peak may have passed, but demand remains high. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this Fall high-season average (~341/period), which provides a base_stock target covering (1+4) periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 8 units on-hand and 1458 in-transit (including large orders from P31-P34), the inventory position is heavily reliant on the upcoming pipeline. mu_hat will be (1+4)*341 = 1705. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to account for the high volatility (612 spike) during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand (P27-P34) average is ~341 units/period, a significant increase from previous spring peaks. High volatility is present (max demand 612 in P33). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak Fall/Winter season. Since Period 27 (early August), demand has significantly shifted upwards from a summer trough of ~100 to a high-season average of ~332 units/period (Periods 27-35). Recent demand shows high volatility, including a peak of 612 in Period 33. Current on-hand inventory is low (74 units), though a large pipeline (1573 units) is expected to arrive starting next period (Period 36 resolution). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) and the observed volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the high-season regime since Period 27) and matching sigma_hat to the same window to capture the recent spikes and ensure sufficient base stock to prevent stockouts during the remainder of the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand (P27-P35) average is ~332 units/period, representing a significant 50% increase over the Spring peak (~220) and a 230% increase over the summer trough. High demand volatility persists in this regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a high-demand fall peak. The regime starting from Period 27 has shown an average demand of ~330 units, significantly higher than the spring peak (~220) and summer trough (~100). Period 36 demand was 282, which is consistent with this high-season regime, though slightly below the P27-P35 average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P32 arrived in P36). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is high (1624 units), covering the next few periods. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current high-season mean (P27-P36 avg is ~327), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the high volatility (peak 612 in P33). This ensures base stock levels are high enough to capture the tapering end of the fall peak while avoiding excessive holding costs as we head into late October.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand (P27-P36) persists with an average of ~327 units/period. High volatility remains a factor (Max 612, SD ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1188.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The fall high-season for the Mariette Blazer (568601006) is well-established, starting specifically at Period 27 (mid-August). The average demand for this regime (P27-P37) is approximately 329 units per period. While early fall (late September) saw extreme peaks (612 units in P33), the most recent demand samples (P34-P37: 313, 283, 282, 313) suggest a slight stabilization around the 300-unit mark as we approach November. Given the high volatility in this regime (\u03c3 \u2248 93 on a per-period basis), I will continue using a recent_N window (N=11) to capture the full Fall regime's behavior. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand (64) and high in-transit (1473) reflects the aggressive ordering done to catch up with the earlier stockouts; the parameters are set to maintain coverage for this high-demand period while accounting for the significant pipeline already in place.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season (P27-P37) average demand is 329 units/period, with high volatility (regime SD ~93). Recent 4 periods (P34-P37) show demand stabilizing near ~300 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak Fall/Winter season. Demand has remained high since Period 27, though it has stabilized somewhat from the extreme peak seen in Period 33 (612 units). The recent demand history for this Fall regime (P27-P38) shows an average of ~332 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) have averaged 315 units, with the most recent observation being 385 units, indicating sustained high demand as we move into November. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P30-P34. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 12 (covering the entire Fall regime from P27-P38) to capture the seasonal average while smoothing out the Period 33 spike. Sigma_hat will also use the last 12 periods to account for the heightened volatility observed during this high season. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to prevent stockouts during the final quarter of the year.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand (P27-P38) average has stabilized at ~332 units/period with significant volatility (SD ~95). Current on-hand and in-transit inventory are well-positioned for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $469.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40, approaching the final stages of the game (total periods 47). The current fall high-season demand (Period 27 onwards) has stabilized at an average of ~332 units per period with significant volatility (SD ~95). Recent demand (Period 39) was lower at 231, but the overall fall trend remains robust. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 40) will arrive in Period 44, leaving only 3 periods of sales potential (45, 46, 47) before the game ends. My current inventory position is strong: 455 units on-hand and 1,164 units in-transit (total 1,619). This inventory covers nearly 5 periods of average high-season demand (1,619 / 332 \u2248 4.87 periods). Given that we have 7 periods remaining and 1,164 units are already in the pipeline (arriving in P40, P41, P42, P43), the system is well-stocked. I will maintain lead-time (L) as 'calculate' based on the stable 4-period observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the entire fall regime (P27-P39) which provides a representative mean of ~332 and reflects the high volatility seen in this period (specifically the peak in P33). This ensures the base stock calculation remains elevated enough to protect against spikes while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering as we near the horizon.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 is in a high-demand fall regime (Period 27 onwards) with an average demand of approximately 329 units per period. The last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a slightly lower but volatile average of ~298 units. With the date approaching mid-November (Period 41), demand for this blazer is expected to remain firm but may begin to stabilize or slightly soften as the peak fall season transitions. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory position is strong: On-hand is 417 units, and in-transit is 1116 units (total 1533). Given the lead time L=4, the safety stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. At the current regime average of ~330 units/period, required stock is ~1650. The current pipeline (1533) is slightly below this, and the OR engine will determine the optimal order based on the parameters. I will use recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full fall regime (P27-P40) while discounting the summer trough, and use the calculate method for L as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Fall high-season demand (P27-P40) average has stabilized at ~329 units/period; however, the most recent 5 periods show a slightly lower average of ~298 units with continued high volatility (SD ~58).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is in its Fall/Early Winter high-season (late November). Demand has been consistently strong since Period 27 (avg ~327), though the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) show a slight cooling to an average of ~271 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 398 and pipeline at 1145, total coverage is 1543 units. Given there are only 6 periods remaining in the game (P42-P47) and lead time is 4, any order placed now will arrive in Period 46 and only be available for the final two periods. To avoid excess holding costs at the end of the simulation while maintaining service levels for the remaining peak weeks, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 15 periods (covering the entire Fall regime) and sigma_hat with the same N to capture the observed volatility (SD ~95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Fall (P27-P41) has averaged ~327 units/period with significant volatility; however, the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) show a slight cooling to ~271 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2776.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a massive demand spike (733 units), potentially indicating a Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak (Date: 2019/11/25). This exhausted all on-hand inventory. Looking ahead, we are at Period 43 of 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now (P43) will arrive in Period 47, which is the final period of the game. Orders placed in P44 or later will not arrive in time to satisfy demand. Therefore, this is the final opportunity to adjust the pipeline for the game's conclusion. The Fall/Winter average (P27-P42) is approximately 352 units, but volatility is extremely high. Given the stockout in P42 and the proximity to the end of the game, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 16 (covering the entire high-season regime from Period 27-42) to capture the elevated demand baseline and the recent spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=16 to account for the high volatility observed in this period. L remains at the stable confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike in Period 42 (733 units), likely tied to late November promotional events (Black Friday). Period 42 ended with 0 on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike (733 units), which significantly depleted inventory. This was likely a Black Friday event. Period 43 demand dropped back to 169 units, suggesting a post-promotion lull. As we are now in Period 44 (Dec 9), we are approaching the final periods of the game (ending at P47). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 48, which is after the game ends. Therefore, my goal is to manage the current on-hand (233) and the massive in-transit pipeline (1234 units) to cover the remaining 4 periods (P44, P45, P46, P47). The pipeline contains orders from P40-P43: P40 (192), P41 (255), P42 (217), and P43 (570). These will arrive in P44, P45, P46, and P47 respectively. Total supply available for the rest of the game is 233 (on-hand) + 1234 (in-transit) = 1467 units. Over 4 periods, this allows for ~366 units/period. Historically, fall high-season demand has averaged ~330. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering the Fall regime since P27) will keep the base stock aligned with high-season expectations while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive terminal overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday spike confirmed in Period 42 (733 units); subsequent Period 43 demand (169 units) indicates a return to baseline or a post-event lull.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1095.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 out of 47. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49 (45 + 4), which is outside the game's duration. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. My objective is to satisfy remaining demand using the existing on-hand inventory (121 units) and the significant pipeline (1502 units) already scheduled to arrive in Periods 45, 46, and 47. Specifically, Period 45 will receive 255 units (from P41), Period 46 will receive 217 units (from P42), and Period 47 will receive 570 units (from P43). Current demand has returned to a baseline of approximately 250-300 units following the Black Friday spike. With over 1000 units arriving before the game ends and only 3 periods of demand left, we are heavily overstocked. I will set the base stock level to a minimal value to prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, thus maximizing profit by avoiding additional holding costs for inventory that cannot be sold.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47. In this terminal phase, any order placed now (Period 46) would arrive at the start of Period 51 (L=4), which is beyond the game's horizon. The system will conclude after Period 47. We currently have 118 units on-hand and 1,247 units in-transit. Given that demand for the last holiday-affected periods (P44-P45) has averaged ~281, and we have only 2 periods remaining (P46, P47), our existing pipeline of 1,247 units and current stock is more than sufficient to cover all possible demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs or go unsold. I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are generated by the OR backend. I'll use the 'explicit' method to reflect the recent high-season volatility and volume while effectively capping the base stock level below current inventory to prevent replenishment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final decision period (Period 47). The product is the Mariette Blazer, which is now in a post-holiday/end-of-year phase (Dec 30). Historical demand recently cooled significantly in Period 46 (128 units) following a volatile fall. In-transit inventory is extremely high (1558 units), which is more than enough to cover any remaining demand for the game's final resolution phase. Given the high in-transit volume and the inventory already on hand (207), our primary goal is to avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for any last-period demand spikes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-Black-Friday stabilization (averaging ~215 units/period), although the capped policy and extremely high pipeline will likely result in a zero order regardless of the parameters chosen. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
