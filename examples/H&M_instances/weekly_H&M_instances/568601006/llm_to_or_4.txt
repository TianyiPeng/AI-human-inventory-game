Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the 'Mariette Blazer' (SKU 568601006). Based on the product description (Women's tailoring, blazer) and the date (Feb 11), we are approaching the spring season when demand for professional/dressed-up attire typically increases as people refresh wardrobes for warmer weather. The provided historical demands for the last 5 periods are [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], which show a slight upward trend (mean: 173.4). Since the promised lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period it is placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the recent upward momentum while ignoring older, potentially lower demand data. Using L=0 (default) ensures the OR system sees the immediate arrival capability. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve the optimal service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 227 units for the 'Mariette Blazer', which significantly exceeded the initial base stock order of 191 units, resulting in a stockout (191 sold, 0 ending inventory). The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed as actual lead time (ordered and arrived in Period 1). Given only one period of live data and the provided historical demands ([161, 145, 179, 196, 186]), the recent demand of 227 represents a potential upward shift as we enter spring (mid-February). I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to account for this higher demand level, while keeping L at the confirmed default of 0. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N to capture the volatility of the recent history including the spike.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is a 'Mariette Blazer', a professional women's tailoring piece. We are currently in late February (Period 3), which typically sees a seasonal rise in demand for spring office wear. Historical data showed steady demand ([161, 145, 179, 196, 186]), but Period 1 and Period 2 experienced a significant jump to 227 and 284 respectively. Because both periods ended with zero stock, the realized demand was constrained by supply; actual demand is likely even higher. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture this sharp upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I will use an explicit forecast. I estimate base weekly demand at ~300 units. With L=0, the OR backend targets (1+L) periods, so mu_hat is set to 300 and sigma_hat is increased to 40 to account for the high volatility and stockout risk during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: demand increased from ~175 avg to 250+ units, coinciding with spring season launch for professional tailoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', showing a clear demand increase coinciding with the mid-February spring tailoring season. Historical demand was ~173 across five pre-game samples, but periods 1 and 2 showed 227 and 284 respectively. While Period 3 demand dipped to 198, the early spring context suggests this is a temporary variance rather than a reversal of the upward trend. The inventory is currently 136 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (order arrives and is available for sale same-period). Given the high demand in P1-P2 (avg 255) and the recent P3 (198), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current spring regime (avg 236 per period). With L=0, mu_hat should target this seasonal average (1+0)*236. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility to ensure sufficient service levels for this high-margin season.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its spring retail season (early March). Previous demand since Period 1 has averaged 230.75 units (227, 284, 198, 214), significantly higher than the pre-history average of 173.4. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and stock replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is 60 units. While the carry-over insight noted a shift to 250+, the last two periods averaged 206, suggesting a slight stabilization or variance in the higher regime. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-demand Spring regime for both mean and volatility, while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of a high-demand spring season for women's professional tailoring. Historical demand since Period 1 has averaged 227.6 units (227, 284, 198, 214, 215), confirming the regime shift noted in Period 3. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as seen in all concluded periods (1 through 5). Current on-hand inventory is 48 units. To maintain the target service level given the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost (75% service level requirement), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stable demand mean of approximately 228 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this seasonal period. Since the lead time is stable at 0, I will use the 'default' method for L.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has moved into a stable demand regime following the initial spring season launch. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P3-P6) has stabilized at approximately 210 units (198, 214, 215, 215), significantly lower than the P2 peak of 284 but consistent with the 'Womens Tailoring' category as we enter late March. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, ensuring immediate fulfillment. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this stable post-peak demand level. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility (standard deviation dropped from ~50 to ~8 in this period). This approach ensures we maintain a lean inventory to minimize holding costs while adequately covering the (1+L) requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~210 units/period (P3-P6) following the initial P1-P2 spring launch spike; volatility has decreased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $712.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8 (April 1st). Reviewing the history for the 'Mariette Blazer', the initial spring launch peak (P1-P2, avg ~255) has settled into a stable demand regime from P3-P7 with a mean of 205.6 units and a lower standard deviation of approximately 14.1. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 7 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low at 32 units, and there is no stock in-transit. Given the stability over the last 5 periods (P3-P7), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this stabilized demand while filtering out the initial launch noise. This will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient for the current pace without over-ordering based on the high-volume start.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring) is in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Historically, we saw a spring launch spike in P1-P2, followed by a stabilization phase. However, P8 demand jumped to 249 units (stocking out), likely signaling a mid-spring demand resurgence or seasonal peak. Analyzing recent demand: P3-P8 demands are [198, 214, 215, 215, 186, 249]. The mean of the last 6 periods is ~213, but the stockout in P8 suggests current demand is exceeding this. To avoid lost sales, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the stable regime while acknowledging the recent spike. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use the mean of the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) which is 212.8, plus a small buffer for the stockout; however, since I must use a method, I will use recent_6. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen in P8.

Carry-over insight: Mid-spring demand resurgence detected in Period 8: demand spiked to 249 units after a period of stability (~210 units).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is the 'Mariette Blazer', a spring/professional garment. Recent demand history shows high volatility: a spike in Period 8 (249) followed by a sharp drop in Period 9 (178). Historical averages have fluctuated significantly (Period 1-2: ~255, Period 3-7: ~205, Period 8-9: ~213). Given the mid-April date (2019/4/15), the demand is likely transitioning from early spring peak to a fluctuating stabilization phase. To capture the current behavior and account for the recent volatility observed in the last two periods, I will use a recent_N of 5 (covering Periods 5-9). This window balances the stability seen in March with the volatile uptick in early April. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, which is confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in the mid-to-late spring season. Historical data shows significant demand variability: early seasonal spikes (P1-P2: 227-284 units), a relative stabilization (P3-P7: ~210 units), a mid-spring resurgence (P8: 249 units), and a recent sharp decline in the last two periods (P9-P10: 178 and 130 units). The current period is late April (2019/4/22); for professional women's tailoring, we often see a deceleration in demand as the peak spring buying season concludes. Given the most recent two observations (178, 130), using a longer window like the default or the last 5-7 periods would significantly overestimate demand and lead to excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent cooling trend (avg ~186 units) while still acknowledging the P8 spike. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed shipments reported, so 'default' (promised L=0) is appropriate. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent increase in volatility compared to the P3-P7 period.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration detected in late April (P9-P10): demand dropped from 249 (P8) to 130 (P10), signaling the end of the peak spring tailoring season.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29, 2019), the 'Mariette Blazer' is entering the late spring/early summer transition. Historical data shows a clear downward trend in demand, decreasing from a peak of 249 in Period 8 to 130 and 127 in Periods 10 and 11 respectively. This confirms the earlier insight that the peak spring tailoring season has concluded. Given the promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently met every period thus far), I am setting L to default. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent regime of lower demand (Periods 9, 10, 11: 178, 130, 127). This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock downward to prevent excess inventory as the product likely phases out of peak season. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to reflect the current lower volatility level.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early May (2019/5/6). Historically, demand for this 'Womens Tailoring' blazer spiked in February/March (spring launch) and again in early April. However, late April (P10-P11) saw a significant drop to 127-130 units. Period 12 showed a bounce back to 191 units, though we stock-outed because the order was too low. Given the volatility and the end of the primary spring season, I suspect a lower, post-peak regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently at 0, I need to replenish. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (P10: 130, P11: 127, P12: 191) to capture the recent deceleration while accounting for the P12 bounce. This averages ~149 units per period. Setting L=0 explicitly as it has been stable.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak regime shift: Demand in late April/early May (P10-P12) has averaged ~149 units, a significant decrease from the early spring average of ~210 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the Mariette Blazer is in a post-peak demand regime. Since late April (Period 10), demand has averaged 152 units (130, 127, 191, 160). The spike in Period 12 (191) appears to be a minor fluctuation within a general downward trend as the peak spring tailoring season concludes. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a sufficient service level (profit/cost ratio suggests a target service level of ~80%), I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand average (approx. 152 units) and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen in the last month. This approach sets a base stock that covers the expected 152 units plus a safety buffer while preventing the overstocking that would occur if using the full historical mean (~195).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th, 2019. The 'Mariette Blazer' is in a post-peak spring demand phase. Historical demand for the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) has been [130, 127, 191, 160, 196] with an average of 160.8. We have observed a recurring pattern of slight demand surges (P12: 191, P14: 196) after periods of lower demand, suggesting late-season demand volatility rather than a clean trend. Period 14 ended with 0 inventory after selling all available stock (178 units) against a demand of 196, showing lost sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To adapt to this higher recent demand while acknowledging the seasonal decline noted in carry-over insights, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the average of the recent volatility (161 units per period). I will use a larger window for sigma_hat (N=10) to account for the swings between 127 and 196, helping the OR model protect against stockouts during these intermittent spikes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27) finds the Mariette Blazer in a post-peak spring regime. Recent demand has fluctuated but appears to have settled into a lower-velocity range compared to the early spring peak. Following the carry-over insight from Period 13, demand from P13-P15 averaged 166 units (160, 196, 143). This is significantly lower than the ~210 units seen in March. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods. We are currently holding 50 units. To balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent post-peak trend (P11-P15), which averages 163.4 units per period. This acknowledges the slow-down while maintaining enough stock to cover moderate upside volatility as we approach the end of May.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a post-peak spring demand phase. Analysis of the recent history (P10-P16) shows demand fluctuating between 127 and 196 units, with a 7-period average of approximately 159 units. The most recent three periods (P14-P16) show demand of 196, 143, and 168 (avg 169). In contrast, the mid-spring 'busy' season (P1-P9) had much higher volatility and higher peaks. Given the current date (June 3), we are entering the summer season where demand for 'woven fabric' blazers typically stabilizes at a lower base or continues a slow deceleration before early autumn transitions. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current stable-but-lower demand regime post-April peak, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current moderate volatility. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that factors in the 4:1 Profit/Holding ratio (80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May/early June (P13-P16): average demand approximately 167 units, showing a return to stability after April's decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (item 568601006) is currently in a stabilized regime following the peak spring season. Observation of Period 17 shows a significant demand drop to 118 units, the lowest since Period 11, potentially indicating the start of a summer slowdown. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 157 units, with a noticeable decline in the most recent period. Given the product is women's tailoring (blazers), demand often softens in mid-June as the weather warms and the professional spring hiring/event season concludes. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this recent stabilization and slight downward trend. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and responsive inventory management. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the service level requirement is moderately high (80%), but current on-hand inventory (65) covers over 50% of recent average demand, reducing the immediate order requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in Period 17 (118 units): highest drop since mid-April, suggests transition from late spring stability (~167 units) to summer seasonal lows.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a women's blazer (Womens Tailoring), which traditionally sees a demand decline heading into the peak summer months. Historical data supports this: demand in Period 17 was 118 units and Period 18 was 139 units, both notably lower than the late-May average of ~167 units. This confirms the seasonal transition toward a summer low first noted in Period 18's insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Based on the last two periods (P17-P18), the mean demand has shifted to approximately 128.5 units with moderate volatility. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward momentum while including the last stable period (P16=168) as a safety buffer against stockouts, as on-hand inventory is low (43 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift to summer seasonal lows confirmed (P17-P18): average demand decreased to ~128.5 units, down from late-spring average of ~167 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in a summer seasonal low period (late June). In Period 19, the demand was 122 units, following 139 in P18 and 118 in P17. The average for this most recent regime (P17-P19) is 126.33 units, which is a significant drop from the May average (~167 units) and much lower than the early spring peak. Given the start of summer, I expect demand to remain stable at these lower levels or potentially decrease slightly further. Leading time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a high holding cost environment ($1/unit vs $4 profit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this localized summer baseline. This allows the OR engine to respond to the most recent demand deceleration while maintaining sufficient buffer for typical mid-summer volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Tailored Blazer) is currently in a summer seasonal low. Demand has significantly decelerated from the spring peak (~210 units) and the late-spring stability (~167 units). In Period 20, demand dropped to 73 units, the lowest observed in the entire history. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is approximately 113 units, but the most recent figure suggests a deeper local dip. Given the date (July 1st), we are entering the heart of summer where heavyweight tailoring typically sees minimal interest. I will set the demand regime to the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this downward trend while maintaining a buffer for typical summer variance. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages in history.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal demand floor reached in Period 20: demand dropped to 73 units, marking a ~56% decrease from the late-spring average of 167 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is clearly in a summer seasonal low. Demand in the most recent periods (P20-P21) has averaged ~94.5 units (73 and 116), significantly lower than the late-spring average of ~167 units. The current date (July 8) typically represents the peak of summer vacation and the lowest demand period for formal professional tailoring before autumn preparations begin. Observed lead time consistently remains 0. With an on-hand inventory of 21 units, I need to stock for the current period's demand (P22) which is expected to stay near these summer lows. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering Periods 17-21) to capture the transition and stabilization into this lower demand regime (avg ~113.6 in that window). This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough while maintaining a sufficient buffer for moderate demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal floor confirmed for July: P20-P21 average demand is ~94.5, a ~43% reduction from the P13-P16 late-spring average of 167 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently in a summer seasonal trough for the Mariette Blazer (Womens Tailoring). Since mid-June (Period 19), demand has shifted significantly lower compared to the spring peak. The last three periods (P20-P22) have seen demands of 73, 116, and 120, averaging approximately 103 units. This period (P23, July 15) remains firmly in the summer seasonal floor before any potential late-summer or 'back-to-office' autumn uptick. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals (P1-P22). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this stabilized summer floor (~103 units) and sigma_hat with N=6 to provide a buffer for the volatility observed during this transition (demands ranging from 73 to 122).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal floor for blazer demand identified (P20-P22) at approximately 103 units per period, down from late-spring average of 167.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a summer seasonal demand floor. Analysis of the most recent periods shows demand has stabilized since late June: Period 21 (116), Period 22 (120), and Period 23 (120). This represents a consistent 'floor' averaging approximately 118.7 units over the last 3 periods, slightly higher than the 103 units identified in Period 23's carry-over but significantly lower than the spring peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this lower-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this stabilized July floor. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the most current, relevant data point for this seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal floor for blazer demand stabilized in July (P21-P23) at an average of ~119 units, showing high consistency (0% variance in the last two weeks).

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently at its summer seasonal floor. In Period 24, demand dropped significantly to 63 units, following a period of relative stability around 119-120 units (P21-P23). This drop likely reflects the late-summer retail lull before late-August 'back-to-work' or autumn resets. The Lead Time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. I am reducing mu_hat to reflect this current drop, using a recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend of the last month which averages 98.4 units, while allowing for the possibility that the 63-unit demand is an outlier or the beginning of a final summer dip. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to reflect the increased volatility introduced by this recent drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late July (P24): demand dropped to 63 units after three weeks of stability at ~118 units, suggesting a potential final summer clearance or season-end lull.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a summer seasonal low. Following a significant drop in P24 (demand=63), P25 saw a moderate recovery to 94 units. The average demand over the last two periods is 78.5, and the average over the last five periods (P21-P25) is 102.6. Given the date (August 5th), we are likely at the transition point between summer clearance and the early onset of autumn tailoring demand (which often begins in mid-to-late August). However, current evidence still supports a lower-than-spring regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer floor and high volatility (standard deviation is roughly 25.6 in this 5-period window), which allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for recent demand levels while maintaining a safety buffer for potential early autumn upticks. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 26 (146 units) signals a significant break from the summer seasonal floor established in July, which averaged around 103-119 units. This uptick coincides with mid-August, a period typically associated with the 'Back-to-Business' or early Autumn fashion transition, where demand for professional attire like blazers begins to recover from summer lows. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 26. To capture this emerging upward trend while maintaining safety against volatility, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand statistics (Periods 24-26 coverage). This focuses on the most recent shift (63, 94, 146) to project a more responsive mean and higher volatility estimate. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand began recovering from summer lows in early August (Period 26: 146 units), signaling the start of the 'Back-to-Business' autumn transition for blazers.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered a rapid demand recovery phase following the summer seasonal floor, which aligns with 'Back-to-Business' autumn trends. Period 27 saw a massive demand spike to 301 units, which is effectively double the previous demand (146 units in P26). This confirms a significant regime shift. Given the product is a professional blazer, August traditionally signals the start of peak autumn sales. To capture this shift while protecting against stockouts, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent demand spike (301 units). Although the previous average was much lower, servicing this new peak is critical. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I've set mu_hat at 310 to ensure we meet this new demand level, and increased sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to account for the heightened volatility during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand transition to Autumn peak confirmed: Period 27 demand surged to 301 units, a 100%+ increase from Period 26. This marks a definitive end to summer lows and the start of a High-Demand autumn regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the 'Back-to-Business' autumn peak. Period 27 saw a massive spike to 301 units, followed by 251 units in Period 28. This confirms a new high-demand regime significantly above the summer floor (~100-115 units). The avg demand for the last two periods (P27-P28) is 276 units. Although the summer was low, current demand behavior mimics the early spring launch (P1-P2 saw 227 and 284 units). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this immediate autumn surge (276 units/period). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=2 to account for the high volatility seen during these regime transitions. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn 'Back-to-Business' peak confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~118 (July) to ~276 (late August), a ~134% increase. This matches the scale of the initial Spring launch in February.

Daily Reward (R_t): $849.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has firmly transitioned into the Autumn 'Back-to-Business' high-demand regime as of August (Period 27). Over the last three periods (P27-P29), demand has averaged 261 units (301, 251, 231), which is a significant increase from the summer low and consistent with the early spring peak observed in February (P1-P2 saw ~255 avg). Given this sharp shift, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the irrelevant summer data. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 75 units, and a stocking level reflecting this 260+ unit demand is necessary to avoid stockouts during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime confirmed (P27-P29): Average demand is ~261 units, marking a return to peak seasonal levels similar to the February launch phase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a high-demand Autumn 'Back-to-Business' regime. Period 30 demand was 357 units, confirming a sustained peak after the August transition. Since Period 27, demand has averaged approximately 285 units (301, 251, 231, 357), justifying a shift to recent_N sampling to reflect this new seasonal level. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 30, so the OR backend needs to replenish fully for the high demand. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific behavior of the current autumn peak (Periods 27-30).

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand peak intensity confirmed: Average demand for the 4rd week of the transition (Period 30) reached 357, exceeding the initial August surge and matching the highest spring launch volumes. Transition average (P27-P30) is ~285 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September is peak 'Back-to-Business' season for women's tailoring. The demand for product 568601006 has shifted into a high-demand autumn regime starting in August. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P27-P31) shows a significant move from summer lows to an average demand of approximately 293.6 units (301, 251, 231, 357, 328). The most recent two periods (357 and 328) suggest a sustained peak above 300 units. Given that lead time remains consistently 0, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 320 to satisfy this established peak demand and avoid stockouts as seen in Period 30. sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for the current volatility (range ~230 to 350) and ensure a high service level during this profitable window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn 'Back-to-Business' peak sustained through mid-September: P30-P31 average demand is ~342 units, confirming a stronger peak than the initial August surge.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in its peak 'Back-to-Business' autumn regime. Demand has been extremely strong and consistent over the last three periods (P30-P32), with demand values of 357, 328, and 341 respectively. This results in a recent average of approximately 342 units. Despite high order quantities (333 and 358), on-hand inventory remains low (22 units) due to the intensity of the peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts during this high-demand window, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (N=3) to focus precisely on the current peak level. Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to capture the current volatility of this specific regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn 'Back-to-Business' peak intensity confirmed: Average demand for the last 3 weeks (P30-P32) has stabilized at ~342 units, significantly higher than the initial August transition average (~261).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) has entered an extreme peak demand phase in late September. In Period 33, demand surged to 612 units, nearly double the previous high-demand average of ~342 units. This aligns with the 'Back-to-Business' autumn peak reaching its maximum intensity as the weather cools and corporate calendars accelerate. Because the previous period resulted in a complete stockout (0 on-hand) despite a high order volume (333 units), I must aggressively increase parameters to capture this peak while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh the recent transition to higher volume (P30-P33 average demand is ~410 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme Autumn peak intensity confirmed in late September (Period 33): Demand spiked to 612 units, a ~79% increase over the previous 3-week average of ~342 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the Autumn 'Back-to-Business' season for women's tailoring. Period 33 saw an extreme demand spike (612 units), which retreated to 313 units in Period 34. While the spike was likely a one-time peak, the overall regime remains significantly higher than summer levels. For Period 35 (early October), demand is expected to remain robust but likely level off or begin a very gradual decline toward mid-autumn. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 390 units. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime while smoothing out the extreme P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to account for the high volatility seen recently. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand peak sequence (P30-P34) average is 390 units, characterized by extreme volatility (range 313-612), significantly exceeding the initial August transition average of 261.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in its peak 'Autumn High-Demand' regime (mid-August to October). Recently, demand has shown extreme volatility, with a significant spike to 612 units in Period 33, followed by a correction to 313 and 283 in the last two periods. The average demand over the last six periods (P30-P35) is approximately 372 units. While the last two weeks suggest a slight cooldown from the extreme late-September peak, October typically maintains high demand for professional tailoring before the year-end transition. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P30-P35) to capture this current high-volume regime while smoothing out the extreme P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility observed recently. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand peak stabilization: Following the extreme spike in P33 (612 units), demand has moderated to an average of ~298 units (P34-P35), suggesting a stabilization of the peak period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has moved past the extreme September peak (Period 33 demand of 612) and has stabilized into a consistent Autumn high-demand regime. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand has been remarkably steady, recording 313, 283, and 282 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of approximately 293 units. With the current date being October 21st, this level reflects the sustained demand before any potential late-autumn or pre-holiday shifts. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To accurately reflect this stabilized high-demand phase while accounting for the recent decrease in volatility compared to the late-September peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current stability, and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to capture sufficient volatility from the peak transition without being skewed by the single massive outlier in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand stabilization confirmed (P34-P36): Demand has leveled off at an average of ~293 units with very low variance after the late September extreme peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in its peak Autumn 'Back-to-Business' phase. Since Period 34 (early October), demand has shown a highly stable pattern following the extreme September spike (612 units). Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has leveled off with values of 313, 283, 282, and 313, resulting in an average of approximately 298 units per period. The Carry-over Insights for Period 37 confirm this stabilization at around 293 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 77 units, and with demand remaining steady at ~300 units, the inventory needs replenishment to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this stable post-peak regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a balanced forecast reflective of current late-October/early-November demand while the backend handles the service level logic (profit/holding cost ratio).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of its high-demand Autumn 'Back-to-Business' season. Recent demand has been robust, with Period 38 reaching 385 units, and a 5-period average (P34-P38) of approximately 315 units. Although there was an extreme spike in P33 (612), demand has since stabilized into a more predictable high-volume regime. We are now entering November (P39), where professional tailoring typically remains strong before the holiday shift. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture this current high-demand stabilization (mean ~315) while filtering out the P33 outlier. This provides a mu_hat of ~315 and appropriate sigma_hat for the current volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-demand regime further stabilized (P34-P38): average demand ~315 units, indicating sustained late-autumn strength in blazer demand following the September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/11. We are in the late autumn 'Back-to-Business' regime for this blazer. Period 39 demand was 231, following a spike of 385 in Period 38. The carry-over insights indicate that since Period 34, the regime has stabilized at an average of ~315 units. However, looking at the last 6 periods (P34-P39), the demand sequence is [313, 283, 282, 313, 385, 231], yielding a mean of ~301. The drop to 231 in Period 39 could be a random fluctuation or the beginning of a late-season taper, but given the sustained strength throughout October, I will prioritize the recent 6-period window to capture this high-demand stability while reflecting the increased volatility (standard deviation). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all history. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 6 periods (N=6) to align with the stabilized autumn regime identified since P34.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of its autumn high-demand regime. Since Period 34 (late September), demand has stabilized at a high level. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the average demand is 298 units (313, 283, 282, 313, 385, 231, 278). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. Although there was a slight dip in Period 39 (231), Period 40 (278) shows demand remaining near the ~300 mark. Given the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I will use a recent window (N=7) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current stabilized high-demand state while filtering out the extreme September outlier (612).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized after the extreme late-September peak. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has averaged approximately 251 units (231, 278, 245), which is a decrease from the mid-autumn average of ~315 units recorded in the Carry-over Insights (up to P38). This suggests a transition from the autumn peak toward a more moderate late-autumn/winter regime as we approach December. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough buffer for potential late-year 'dressed' category demand spikes, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (N=3 reflects the shift starting Period 39). This method balances the lower recent mean with a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for potential late-season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand moderation detected (P39-P41): Average demand decreased to ~251 units, down from the mid-autumn (P34-P38) average of ~315 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1088.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a massive demand spike to 733 units. Given the date (2019/11/25), this is clearly the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak for womenswear blazers. The previous multi-week average was approximately 251 units. Historically, after such extreme promotional spikes, demand tends to either moderate back toward the previous late-autumn regime or begin its descent into the winter holiday lull. However, we must remain prepared for sustained 'Cyber Week' elevated demand. Given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the stockout in P42, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value that accounts for the post-peak moderation but remains higher than the pre-peak average to avoid immediate stockouts if demand stays elevated. I estimate demand at 350 units (a blend of the P39-P41 average of 251 and the massive P42 spike, assuming partial regression to the mean). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility introduced by the 733-unit outlier. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike confirmed for late November (Period 42: 733 units), representing a ~192% increase over the previous 3-week average (~251), corresponding to Black Friday/Cyber Week seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history reflects a massive Black Friday/Cyber Week spike in Period 42 (733 units), followed by a sharp drop in Period 43 (169 units). Period 44 (Dec 9) is in the post-Cyber Week lull but approaching the Christmas shopping peak. Looking at the 'Back-to-Business' autumn regime (P34-P41), demand averaged ~293 units. Given the transition from high-intensity promotional spikes to standard holiday shopping, I expect demand to moderate from the 700+ peak but remain higher than the absolute trough of P43 as gift-giving picks up. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the late-autumn average (approx. 290) to avoid over-reacting to the single P43 outlier while maintaining stock for the December season. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the heightened volatility observed during the November period.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand cooling confirmed: Period 43 demand (169 units) represents a return to baseline after the Period 42 spike (733 units), similar to post-peak drops seen in previous seasonal transitions.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (mid-December) shows a stabilization following the massive Black Friday/Cyber Week distortion. Period 42 saw a 733-unit spike, followed by a typical post-peak drop in Period 43 (169 units). However, Period 44 demand rebounded to 304 units, which aligns with pre-holiday shopping for professional/dressed attire. The on-hand inventory is currently 178 units. Given the transition into the late December/Christmas period, demand usually stabilizes or slightly dips before the New Year. I am using recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike baseline (approx 236.5 units), as the multi-month average is inflated by the autumn peak and the single-period Black Friday spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday stabilization confirmed: After the Period 42 spike (733 units) and Period 43 dip (169 units), demand has leveled out at ~300 units (Period 44: 304 units), indicating a steady mid-December baseline for blazers.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), entering the final week of the calendar year. Historical data and product description (Mariette Blazer - Women's Tailoring) suggest that demand typically stabilizes after the Black Friday/Cyber Week spike (P42: 733 units) and the subsequent post-peak drop. Period 43 through 45 have shown demand of 169, 304, and 258 units respectively. The average for the last two weeks (P44-P45) is 281 units, representing a stable pre-holiday baseline. Given that Period 46 is the week of Christmas and Period 47 is the week of New Year's, we anticipate a potential slight softening in tailoring demand as professional activities pause, followed by a possible early January clearance or 'Back-to-Work' preparation. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the post-Black Friday regime (avg ~244) and the same for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the November peak month.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30, the week between Christmas and New Year. Historical data from Period 46 (Dec 23) show a significant demand drop to 128 units, down from the mid-December average of ~281 (P44-P45), signaling the expected post-holiday/end-of-year lull. Given the 'Womens Tailoring | Blazer' description, demand is likely to remain at a seasonal floor as professional wardrobe purchasing pauses for the holidays. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to blend the pre-holiday baseline with the holiday drop, resulting in a more conservative forecast to avoid excess holding costs on a $1/unit item during a slow period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all concluded history (L=0). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility between the mid-December stability and the recent sharp decline.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year seasonal demand floor detected (Period 46): demand dropped to 128 units, a ~54% decrease from the mid-December average (~281), reflecting holiday season inactivity for professional tailoring.
