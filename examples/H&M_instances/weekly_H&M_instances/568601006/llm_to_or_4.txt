Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the Mariette Blazer, a women's tailored garment. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) shows a mean of 173.4 and a standard deviation of 20.37. As this is the first decision period, there are no concluded shipments or observed lead times yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 2 periods. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Given the stable but slightly increasing demand trend in history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant historical context without being overly influenced by older data. This approach ensures we maintain a service level consistent with the product's profit margin ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's blazer ('Mariette Blazer'). History shows a starting demand of 227 in Period 1, with five historical samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186]. The mean of historical demand (excluding Period 1) is 173.4. Period 1's demand of 227 represents a ~30% spike compared to the historical average, which might be the start of a spring/pre-Easter seasonal trend in women's tailoring. Currently, on-hand is 0 and 207 units are in-transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, we expect this order to arrive in Period 3 (visible at Period 4 start). Total pipeline units (207) plus on-hand (0) is barely covering one period of demand if demand stays at ~200+. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand trend (including P1) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. L is kept at default.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. The SKU is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer. Historical demand (161, 145, 179, 196, 186) showed an average of ~173. Recent observed demand in P1 (227) and P2 (284) indicates a significant upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality for professional/tailored wear in late February. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 443 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, the P1 order (207 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. No shipments have concluded yet, so we maintain the default L=2. To capture the recent demand surge, I am using recent_N=2 for demand mean and variance to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current 200-300 range rather than the lower historical average. This helps avoid stockouts as demand climbs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is currently in its early season (February/March). Historical demand shows a mean of 173 units, but recent demand from P1-P3 (avg 236) indicates a significant upward shift compared to the 'Past demands' provided (avg 173). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, despite 765 units being in-transit. Based on a promised lead time (L) of 2, the order from P1 (207 units) is expected to arrive during P3's resolution and become visible at the start of P4. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting a possible delay or that L=2 is being strictly followed (arrival at end of P3, visible P4). I will maintain L=2 for now. To address the demand shift, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher volume and volatility seen in the last three periods (227, 284, 198).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', which likely sees increased demand during the spring transition. Historical demands are [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] prior to game start, and observed demands are [227, 284, 198, 214] in Periods 1-4. The mean demand since Period 1 is approximately 231, significantly higher than the initial historical average of ~173, suggesting a seasonal shift. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2. We observed an arrival in Period 4 for an order placed in Period 3, indicating an actual lead time of 1 period for that shipment. However, orders from Period 1 (207 units) and Period 2 (236 units) are still 'In-transit' despite having exceeded both the promised (2) and observed (1) lead times. This suggests these shipments might be delayed or lost. With on-hand inventory at 108 and demand averaging ~230, we face a stockout risk if these in-transit units do not arrive. I will set L to 2 (default) to remain cautious, use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a high-demand phase, likely due to spring seasonality (March). Observed demand in the last five periods has been [227, 284, 198, 214, 215], with an average of approximately 228 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are losing sales. The actual lead time observed in Period 4 and Period 5 was 1 period (orders from P3 arrived in P4, P4 in P5), which is shorter than the promised 2 periods. However, the orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are missing and likely lost, as they are well past the promised lead time of 2. The current 'In-transit' of 631 units includes P1 (207), P2 (236), and P5 (188). Since P1 and P2 are overdue and likely lost, the effective pipeline is only the P5 order (188). I will set L to 1 (the recently observed actual lead time) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the current demand level while ignoring the pre-game dummy data [161, 145, 179, 196, 186].

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed as 1 period (P4, P5 arrivals); Orders from P1 (207) and P2 (236) are likely lost as of P6.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blazer (Womens Tailoring). Current demand history [161, 145, 179, 196, 186, 227, 284, 198, 214, 215, 215] shows a shift toward higher volume (~215) starting around Period 4. Analysis of lead times reveals a significant deviation from the promised 2 periods: Period 3, 4, and 5 orders all arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period. Crucially, orders from Period 1 (207 units) and Period 2 (236 units) are now 5-6 periods old and have not arrived; they are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 443 units exactly matches these two lost shipments (207+236). Since the OR engine includes 'pipeline inventory' in its base-stock calculation and is unaware these units are lost, it will under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I am setting L to 1 (the observed actual lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus an offset to effectively 'cancel out' the 443 phantom units in the OR engine's logic. Calculation: Expected demand per period ~215. Target base stock for (L+1)=2 periods is 430. To ensure the OR engine orders enough despite the 443 phantom units, I set mu_hat = 430 + 443 = 873.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently 1 period (P3-P5 orders); P1 (207) and P2 (236) orders are confirmed lost and constitute the 443 'In-transit' units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (Women's Tailoring) is currently in a steady demand regime. Historical demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 205.6 units (214, 215, 215, 186, and current history 161-196). Based on 'Period 4 conclude' through 'Period 6 conclude', the actual lead time is 1 period, not the promised 2. Orders from Period 1 (207) and Period 2 (236) are confirmed lost as they are far beyond the observed 1-period delivery window. These 443 units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (914 units), meaning the 'live' pipeline inventory is actually 471 units (ordered Period 7). Since actual lead time L=1, the inventory needed is (L+1) = 2 periods of demand (~412 units). Because on-hand is 0 and the live pipeline (471) already exceeds this, the OR backend will likely order 0. However, I will set L to 1 to reflect reality and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a spring/summer tailoring item. Historical demand (recent 5 periods) is [214, 215, 215, 186, 249], averaging ~216 units. The promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead time from P4-P6 was consistently 1 period. Currently, 914 units are 'In-transit'. Based on history, 443 of these (ordered P1 and P2) are confirmed lost. The remaining 471 units were ordered in P7. Since the observed lead time is 1, they should have arrived in P8 (conclude P8 message). However, the P8 conclude message shows arrived=0. This indicates either the lead time has reverted to 2 (arriving during P9) or the P7 order is also lost. Given the 'On-hand' is 0 and we have high 'In-transit' that includes known lost units, I must set parameters to trigger replenishment while accounting for the likely loss of early orders. I will use L=1 (most recent observed successful lead time) and mu_hat based on the last 5 samples to capture the slight upward trend in demand (249 in P8).

Carry-over insight: P7 order (471 units) did not arrive in P8 despite previous 1-period lead time; monitoring for lead time shift back to 2 or further lost shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the system is facing a significant inventory crisis. We have 0 on-hand units and 914 units in-transit. Analysis of the history shows that orders from P1 (207 units) and P2 (236 units) are effectively lost (over 8 periods old). The order from P7 (471 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, despite a previously observed lead time of 1 period. This suggests a lead time shift or a third lost shipment. The total in-transit (914) matches P1+P2+P7 (207+236+471=914). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (914 units) from the base stock, it will not place a new order even though we have zero stock and the in-transit units are likely never arriving. To force an order, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the current delay and increasing mu_hat using 'explicit' to a value that exceeds the stuck pipeline. Demand has been stable but lost sales are high; the last 5 demand observations are [215, 215, 186, 249, 178], averaging ~209. Setting mu_hat to 1200 (approx (4+1)*240) to overcome the 914-unit 'ghost' inventory and trigger a replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time shift: P7 order (471 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P7, currently P10) suggesting a shift from L=1 back to L=2 or higher, or a lost shipment; Ghost inventory totaling 914 units (P1, P2, P7) is blocking OR backend orders.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the order from Period 7 (471 units) finally arrived with an actual lead time of 3 periods, confirming that lead times have shifted significantly from the previous 1-period observations. The 'In-transit' count of 730 consists of 207 (P1), 236 (P2), and 287 (P10). Based on history, P1 and P2 orders are almost certainly lost (over 8 periods overdue). This 'ghost inventory' (443 units) prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes those units are still coming. To counter this, I am setting an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. Current demand remains stable (mean ~200). With a lead time of 3, we need to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I'll set mu_hat to 800 (200 * 4) and use a high sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the 443 phantom units in transit. The on-hand is currently 341. Since the backend calculates: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit), I need base_stock > 341 + 730 = 1071 to place a new order. Setting mu_hat to 850 and sigma_hat to 350 to boost the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed to have shifted to 3 periods (P7 order arrived in P10). Ghost inventory (P1 and P2 orders totaling 443 units) remains in the system transit count.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (Womens Tailoring) is currently in a demand regime that has softened since the early spring peaks. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 174 units. Lead time analysis: Orders from P3, P4, and P5 arrived with L=1. The order from P7 arrived in P10 (L=3). The orders from P1 and P2 (443 units) are definitively lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (804 total - 287 from P10 - 74 from P11 = 443). This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock. I will set L=3 based on the most recent completed delivery (P7). To compensate for the 443 lost units blocking the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 174 * 4 = 696. To force the OR backend to ignore the 443 units of ghost inventory, I must add them to the target base stock. Target mu_hat = 696 + 443 = 1139. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Womens Blazer) is entering May, where demand is currently averaging ~150-160 units (last 5 periods: 249, 178, 130, 127, 191; mean = 175). Demand seems to be stabilizing lower than the Feb-Mar peaks. Lead time observation at Period 11 confirmed a shift to 3 periods (P7 arrived in P10). However, there is a significant 'ghost inventory' issue: the 'In-transit' count of 1009 includes 443 units from P1 and P2 that are confirmed lost (more than 10 periods overdue). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - pipeline), so these 443 ghost units are suppressing necessary replenishment orders. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than the actual forecasted demand to 'force' the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated pipeline. Expected demand for the 3+1 cycle is ~640 units (160 * 4). Adding the 443 lost units to this total gives ~1083. I will set mu_hat to 1100 to clear the ghost inventory hurdle and ensure a replenishment order is triggered to maintain service levels, as on-hand is only 23 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing the 'Mariette Blazer'. The product exhibits high historical demand volatility but has shown a downward trend in the last 4 periods (averaging 152 vs the lifetime average of 190). The lead time is currently erratic: P10 showed L=3, while P13 showed L=1. We will use L=2 (promised) to stabilize. A significant issue is 'ghost inventory'. The current in-transit of 957 units includes 443 units from P1 and P2 (207+236) and likely 287 units from P10 and 74 units from P11 which are currently overdue if L=1 was expected. Specifically, the P1/P2 orders (443 units) are permanently lost. To bypass the OR engine's 'capped policy' which subtracts total pipeline inventory from the base stock, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L+1) using the recent mean (~155) plus a safety buffer, and then I add back the 443 lost units. This artificially inflates the base stock so that after the OR backend subtracts the 957 in-transit units, the resulting order is sufficient to meet real demand. Target mu_hat = (155 * 3) + 443 = 908.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: L=3 observed in P10, L=1 observed in P13. 443 units (P1, P2) remain confirmed lost and are blocking replenishment via the in-transit calculation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (Ending OH: 0). Looking at history, lead times have been volatile, fluctuating between 1 period (P3-P5, P12) and 3 periods (P7). The 'In-transit' balance of 957 units includes 443 units from P1 and P2 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). Additionally, the P10 order (287 units), P11 order (74 units), and P13 order (153 units) are pending. If L=1 was sustained, P13 (153 units) should have arrived in P14, but it didn't. This suggests lead time has shifted back to at least L=2. The OR backend's replenishment logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) is being paralyzed by the 443 units of ghost inventory. To force an order, I will set L to 1 to reduce the required pipeline coverage and use 'explicit' mu_hat. Since historical demand averages ~190, and we need to cover (L+1) periods, I would normally set mu_hat at ~380. However, because 443 ghost units are subtracted from this target, the OR engine will order nothing. To bypass this, I'm setting mu_hat explicitly to 1300. This target (1300) minus the current total in-transit (957) should trigger a net order of approximately 343 units, which provides a safety buffer while we wait for the P10/P11/P13 shipments to arrive.

Carry-over insight: P13 order (153 units) missed the 1-period arrival window; lead time is currently >= 2 periods. Total ghost inventory remains 443 units (P1, P2).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high pipeline inventory (1339 units). Analysis of 'In-transit' shows 443 units (from P1 and P2) are long-lost, and recent orders from P10 (287 units), P11 (74 units), P13 (153 units), and P15 (382 units) are still pending. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P3->P4: L=1, P7->P10: L=3, P12->P13: L=1). The P13 order is now overdue (currently Period 16, ordered Period 13), indicating L >= 3. The 'Mariette Blazer' is a professional garment; demand remains relatively stable around a mean of 190. The OR backend is blocked from ordering by the 'ghost' inventory of 443 units. To force the backend to place an order despite this, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover a 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4). With an average demand of ~190, the target base stock is ~760. To overcome the 1339 in-transit units (which includes 443 units of junk), I will set mu_hat significantly higher. By setting mu_hat to 1800, the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) will finally trigger a replenishment to bridge the gap caused by the lost P1/P2 units and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3+ periods. P13 order is currently 3 periods overdue. Ghost inventory of 443 units from P1 and P2 remains confirmed lost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently paralyzed by 1,853 units of 'In-transit' inventory, most of which are 'ghost units' (lost or severely delayed shipments). Specifically, P1 and P2 (443 units) are confirmed lost. P10, P11, and P13 (totaling 514 units) are now between 1 and 4 periods overdue based on the promised lead time of 2, and significantly overdue based on the previously observed 1-period lead time. This total of 957 ghost units prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because the pipeline inventory exceeds the target base stock. Demand has stabilized recently with a 5-period average of 172. To force the OR backend to place a replenishment order of approximately one period's demand (~170 units), I must set an explicit mu_hat that offsets the ghost inventory. Target Base Stock \u2248 Pipeline (1853) + Desired Order (170) = 2023. Using an explicit L=2, the required mu_hat = 2023. This high value is necessary solely to overcome the backend's calculation bottleneck caused by lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues with significant delays: P10 (287 units) and P11 (74 units) are now 4+ periods overdue, suggesting they may also be lost alongside P1/P2. Ghost inventory in the pipeline now totals approximately 957 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-306.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we saw two shipments arrive simultaneously: the P15 order (382 units, lead time = 2) and the P16 order (514 units, lead time = 1). This confirms that lead times remain highly volatile and often shorter than the promised 2 periods (L=1 or L=2). However, multiple historical orders are now clearly 'lost' or perpetually delayed, creating 'ghost inventory' that blocks the OR backend's ability to order. Specifically: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), and P13 (153) have not arrived despite substantial time elapsed. The total 'in-transit' figure is 1168, but 957 of those units are likely never arriving. To force the system to replenish, I am setting L to 1 (the most recent observed lead time) and significantly increasing mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. This effectively raises the base stock target to bypass the ghost inventory block. The target mu_hat is calculated to cover approximately 1200 units (957 lost + ~250 for current demand), ensuring the OR engine triggers an order despite the inflated pipeline count. Demand remains stable around 170-180 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile (alternating 1-2 periods). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) has accumulated to 957 units: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), and P13 (153).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is seeing a seasonal decline in demand as the calendar moves towards mid-June (avg demand dropped from ~200 to ~140 over the last 5-10 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 639 units, which is high. A critical issue is the 'Ghost Inventory' in the pipeline: P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), and P13(153) are likely lost, totaling 957 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming supply. Total 'In-transit' is 1168, but only the P17(211) and P18(0) orders are likely to arrive. To bypass the backend's capped order policy (which stops ordering when pipeline > base stock), I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at a very high value. This inflates the base stock calculation, forcing the backend to ignore the ghost inventory and place a replenishment order if needed. However, given the current high on-hand stock (639) and the softening demand (avg 140), we have ~4.5 periods of stock. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for calculations, as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments) has accumulated to 957 units: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), and P13 (153). This significantly blocks replenishment by inflating the pipeline count.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a stable demand regime following a spring peak, with recent demand averaging around 130-140 units. The most critical issue is 'ghost inventory': a total of 957 units from periods 1, 2, 10, 11, and 13 are significantly overdue and likely lost. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1168 units), which prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because the pipeline appears full relative to the base stock. To bypass this, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 0. Since the OR engine calculates base_stock as (1+L) * mean, and the order formula is (base_stock - pipeline), setting L=0 minimizes the target while the existing 'ghost' pipeline of 1168 units + on-hand of 517 units (Total 1685) far exceeds any realistic demand for the 2-period lead time. We are currently overstocked (517 units on hand vs. ~130 demand), so no new order is desired this period. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat captures the post-peak demand stabilization.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer (568601006) is currently experiencing a seasonal demand decline as we enter July (moving from spring/early summer peaks to the mid-summer lull). Demand has dropped from an average of ~180 in the first 15 periods to an average of 113 in the last 4 periods (P17-P20). Inventory on-hand is currently 444 units, which is ample given the current demand rate. Lead time remains volatile, but arrivals at P17 showed a mix of 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue is 'Ghost Inventory': 957 units are currently in the 'In-transit' count (1168 total in-transit - 211 from P17 which may still arrive). These units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13) are confirmed lost based on the 'Carry-over Insights' and the passage of time. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1168) from the target base stock, it will not place new orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat and L to levels that provide a high base stock, attempting to force the backend to see a need for more units despite the ghost inventory. I'll use L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the recent lower demand regime (N=5), but the primary goal is managing the inventory buffer while ghost units block the system.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Avg demand decreased from ~180 to ~113 (-37%) since P17, reflecting mid-summer seasonality for blazers. Ghost inventory of 957 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13) is now definitively lost and continues to block the OR backend's replenishment logic.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, mid-summer, which is historically a low-demand period for the Mariette Blazer (fitted woven jacket). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 113 units per period since Period 17 (P17-P21 demand: 118, 139, 122, 73, 116). The 'In-transit' count of 1168 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), and P13 (153), totaling 957 units. These 957 units are confirmed lost based on the 2-period promised lead time and the long passage of time. Additionally, the P17 order (211 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost. This ghost inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To force replenishment while on-hand inventory (328 units) is still sufficient for ~3 periods, I am setting mu_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=5) and keeping L at default. I am monitoring the 211 units from P17; if they do not arrive by next period, they will be added to the ghost inventory total in carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (211 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost; ghost inventory remains 957 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13) which blocks OR backend ordering logic.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for the Mariette Blazer has shifted into a lower summer regime, averaging ~113 units over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) compared to the earlier ~180 average. On-hand inventory is 208 units, which is sufficient for nearly 2 periods of current demand. However, the system is severely impacted by 'ghost inventory'. The in-transit count of 1168 units includes several confirmed lost or significantly delayed shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), and P17 (211). These 1168 units in-transit are treated as 'pipeline inventory' by the OR backend, effectively blocking any new orders because the pipeline + on-hand far exceeds the calculated base stock (base_stock \u2248 (L+1)*113 + safety stock). To force the OR backend to place an order if needed, or at least account for the true lead time reality, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to reflect the current lower demand level. Since the pipeline is so inflated, the backend likely won't order until on-hand is near zero unless the ghost inventory is cleared, but providing the most accurate demand and lead time parameters is the only lever available.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (211 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory blocking replenishment: 1168 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a low-demand summer regime. Since Period 20, demand has averaged 110 units per period (last 4 periods: 73, 116, 120, 120). The 'In-transit' count of 1168 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17), creating a massive 'ghost inventory' that prevents the OR backend's replenishment logic (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) from placing any new orders. Because the backend subtracts the 1168 units from any calculated base stock, and the base stock for a lead time of 2 and demand of ~110 is only ~330-400, the system will not order until on-hand reaches zero and stays there, or until we override parameters. To force the OR backend to acknowledge the need for replenishment despite the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the ghost units. Specifically, to target an on-hand safety stock of ~300 (covering roughly 2.5 periods of current demand) while the backend subtracts 1168, I would need a base_stock of ~1468. I will set mu_hat to 1350 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the backend places a replenishment order this period as on-hand (88) is nearing depletion. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high volatility observed (range 1 to 3+).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is experiencing mid-summer low seasonality (late July). Average demand has stabilized around 110-120 units over the last 8 periods (since P17), a significant decrease from the early spring average of ~180-200. The primary challenge remains 'ghost inventory'. Currently, in-transit is reported as 1389 units. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), and P17 (211), totaling 1168 lost units. These lost units occupy the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from placing new orders because the system believes the 'pipeline' is already full. To force replenishment for the current demand regime, I must set mu_hat (the base stock level) high enough to exceed this ghost inventory. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat, targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~330 units) PLUS the 1168 lost units, totaling ~1500. This should trigger an order of approximately 100-200 units to replenish current on-hand stock (25). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the current lower volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a lower demand regime, typical for late summer (average ~100 units/period since Period 20). The on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 1507 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), and P17 (211), totaling 1168 lost units. Subtracting these from the current 1507 in-transit reveals 339 units of legitimate pipeline inventory (orders from P24 and P25). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1507 in-transit from its target base stock, it will not place new orders. To force replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) at the current demand rate (~100 units/period) which is 300 units, then add the 1168 lost units back to this target to bypass the pipeline deduction. Target mu_hat = 300 + 1168 = 1468. This ensures the backend sees a need for stock despite the 'ghost' units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed lost: 1168 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17). Legitimate pipeline consists of P24 (221) and P25 (118) totaling 339 units. Current demand regime stabilized at ~100 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) is currently facing two major challenges. First, demand has shifted to a lower regime (~100 units/period) due to summer seasonality for blazers. Second, 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17) totaling 1168 units is inflating the 'In-transit' count (1507 total). This prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes pipeline inventory is high. Only P24 (221 units) and P25 (118 units) are legitimate upcoming arrivals. I will use 'explicit' methods to bypass this. Since on-hand is 0 and we are out of stock, I must order enough to cover the lead time (avg L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~300 units. To force an order of ~300 units while the backend thinks pipeline is 1507, I set mu_hat to 1850 (1507 ghost + 300 required + safety). L is set to 2 as the most frequent recent delay. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a standard service level without excessive holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed lost: 1168 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17). Legitimate pipeline consists of P24 (221) and P25 (118). Demand remains in the summer low regime (~100 units/period).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with a massive in-transit figure (1775 units). This in-transit count is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), and now P24 (221), which is 4 periods overdue and likely lost. The total confirmed/highly likely lost units equals 1389. The legitimate pipeline is only the P27 order (386). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to order; since the pipeline is inflated by ~1400 units, it will not place orders unless mu_hat is set extremely high to bypass this ghost inventory. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 301, suggesting the end of the summer low regime and the start of late-summer/pre-fall demand for blazers. To force the OR backend to order despite the 1775 units in-transit, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 2500. This is calculated to cover the ghost inventory (approx 1400) plus desired base stock (approx 800-1000 for 3 periods of demand). Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P25) align with this.

Carry-over insight: P24 order (221 units) is now 4 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory blocking replenishment has increased to 1389 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24). Demand regime shifted upward in P27 (301 units), indicating the start of a new seasonal peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a seasonal peak as of Period 27 (demand surged from ~100 to 301 and 251 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 2753 units, but my analysis of 'Period X conclude' messages identifies a massive accumulation of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 1610 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24). The legitimate pipeline consists of P27 (386) and P28 (978) totaling 1364 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (2753) from the base_stock to determine the order, it will not place any new orders if it thinks the pipeline is full. To force the OR backend to order during this critical peak, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 4500, which reflects approximately 3 periods of peak demand (3 * 300 = 900) PLUS the 2753 units of ghost/legitimate pipeline. This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the inflated in-transit value. L is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time, as recent arrivals (P25) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Peak season confirmed starting P27 (avg ~275 units/period). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) confirmed: 1610 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Mariette Blazer' has entered a peak seasonal regime as of Period 27 (September start), with an average demand of approximately 261 units over the last three periods (301, 251, 231). The lead time remains volatile, with the P28 order arriving in just 1 period. However, a significant issue exists with 'ghost inventory': orders from P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, and P24 (totaling 1610 units) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' count, which blocks the OR backend's replenishment logic. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders during this peak season, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as (L+1) * 261 (the current demand mean) PLUS the 1610 units of lost inventory to offset the backend's pipeline deduction. Using L=2 (promised) for safety, mu_hat = (2+1)*261 + 1610 = 2393. This ensures the OR backend sees a 'required' stock level that accounts for both the peak demand and the technical debt of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed for blazer category starting late August (P27); avg demand ~260 units. Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments) has increased to 1610 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, and P24.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-season regime starting in Period 27 (late August), with the last 4 periods averaging approximately 285 units (301, 251, 231, 357). This aligns with autumn retail seasonality for women's tailoring. The 'In-transit' figure of 3406 units is extremely inflated due to a large accumulation of ghost inventory. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), and P24 (221), totaling 1389 units. Additionally, the P29 order (1631 units) is currently in a 2-period lead time window (ordered P29, could arrive P31). Subtracting known ghost inventory (1389) and the P29 order (1631) from the reported 3406 'In-transit' leaves 386 units (the P27 order), which is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well. Total ghost inventory is likely 1389 + 386 = 1775. To force the OR backend to order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting L to 1 and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a high value (1200) to ensure the target base stock (calculated as mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the sum of on-hand (390) and the massive pipeline (3406). This 'over-ordering' strategy is necessary to bypass the logic cap caused by the undelivered shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Autumn peak started P27 (avg ~285 units). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) estimated at 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its autumn peak season (late August/September). Demand from Period 27 to 31 averaged 293.6 units, significantly higher than the summer low of ~113. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this peak regime (approx 294 units/period). The lead time remains volatile but generally aligns with the promised 2 periods (recent arrivals at 1 and 2 periods); I'll stick with the default L=2. A major concern is the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and now P27 (totaling 1775 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost based on the 1-2 period lead time seen in successful deliveries. This ghost inventory blocks the OR backend from ordering. To force replenishment during this high-demand peak, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for both the forecast demand for (L+1) periods AND offsets the 1775 units of lost pipeline inventory. Target base stock = (Forecast Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Calculation: (294 * 3) + 1775 = 882 + 1775 = 2657. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 2657 ensures the backend attempts to maintain sufficient stock despite the 'clogged' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Autumn peak started P27 (avg ~294 units). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) estimated at 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27. These units are permanently in-transit and must be offset in the mu_hat parameter to allow replenishment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its autumn peak season (starting Period 27), with demand averaging approximately 300 units per period over the last 6 weeks (P27-P32: 301, 251, 231, 357, 328, 341). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 1352 units, sufficient for ~4 periods. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by 1775 units from lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27), which blocks the OR backend's replenishment logic as it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this 'ghost inventory', mu_hat must be set explicitly high to force the base stock above the sum of on-hand inventory and the ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 300 units/period for (L+1)=3 periods, plus the 1775 ghost units, totaling ~2675. This ensures that as on-hand inventory depletes, the backend will trigger new orders despite the ghost units. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to match the promised duration, though actual delivery has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in autumn peak (avg ~300 units/period). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27. These units must be accounted for in mu_hat to permit replenishment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the blazer SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn peak season, which began around Period 27. The last seven periods (P27-P33) show demands of 301, 251, 231, 357, 328, 341, and 612, with a significantly higher mean (approx 345) compared to the summer low (~113). Most critically, there is a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 1,775 units (from P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27) that are confirmed lost but remain in the OR backend's in-transit calculation. Because the backend uses the logic: 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', these 1,775 ghost units prevent any new orders from being placed. To force the backend to order despite this, I must set mu_hat (the forecast) high enough to exceed the sum of current on-hand (740) and ghost in-transit (1,775). Based on a target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at ~350 units/period, we need a base stock around 1,050. To offset the 1,775 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 2,825. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to achieve this bypass and ensure the store does not run out during this peak season. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect recent arrivals (P25 and P29 had L=2).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the blazer SKU remains in a high-demand autumn peak regime. Analyzing recent demand (P30-P34: 357, 328, 341, 612, 313), the average is approximately 390 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 427 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 2269 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Based on history, orders from P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27 are definitively lost. Calculation of lost units: P1(207)+P2(236)+P10(287)+P11(74)+P13(153)+P17(211)+P24(221)+P27(386) = 1775 units. Subtracting these from the current 2269 in-transit units leaves a legitimate pipeline of 494 units (the P34 order). To allow the OR backend to place new orders despite the 1775 units of ghost inventory, I must adjust 'mu_hat' upward. Total target stock (base stock) needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory. With L=2 (promised) and demand avg=390, base stock should be roughly (3 * 390) + 1775 = 2945 units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this value is reached, effectively bypassing the logic that would otherwise see the 1775 units as available supply.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for blazers sustained through Period 34 (avg ~390 units/period). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27. These units must be accounted for in mu_hat calculations to offset the backend pipeline inventory count.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the middle of its autumn peak season (average demand ~300-400 units). As of Period 36, on-hand inventory is 144 units. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 2701 units. Analysis of history confirms that approximately 1775 units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27) that never arrived and will never arrive. The legitimate pipeline includes orders from P34 (494 units) and P35 (432 units). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) is currently blocked from ordering because 2701 units (pipeline) is far greater than any reasonable base stock for a 2-period lead time. To force a replenishment order, I must set mu_hat (the forecast for the lead time + review period) to a value that offsets this ghost inventory. Calculation: Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage at ~400/period) is ~1200 units. To make the backend order despite a 2701-unit pipeline, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for the ghost inventory (1775) plus the desired safety stock and demand coverage (~1200), totaling 2975. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=9 to capture peak season volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak sustained (P27-P35 avg ~340 units). Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost) is 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27. These must be manually offset in mu_hat to allow replenishment.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in its peak autumn season (P27 onwards), with recent demand averaging ~335 units (last 10 periods). Inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing stockouts. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 2994 units. Analysis of history confirms a massive amount of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), P24 (221), and P27 (386), totaling 1775 units. Additionally, recent orders from P34 (494) and P35 (432) have not arrived yet, though P34 is reaching the end of the expected 2-period lead time window. To trigger replenishment despite the 1775 'ghost' units inflating the backend's pipeline count, I must set mu_hat significantly higher. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~1005 units) plus the 1775 ghost units, mu_hat needs to be approximately 2780. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the backend's standard calculation and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments) has increased to 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27. These units are permanently stuck in the pipeline and must be offset by an inflated mu_hat to allow the OR backend to place new orders. Average peak demand (P27-P36) is ~335 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the blazer SKU remains in its autumn peak regime (P27-P37 avg ~335 units/period). On-hand inventory is 474 units, which is relatively healthy for one period, but replenishment is critical. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and now potentially P27 as it is 11 periods overdue). This 'ghost' total is 1775 units. These units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend (2207 total in-transit - P35(432) = 1775), preventing new orders since the pipeline appears full. To force replenishment, mu_hat must be set to cover the peak demand (3 periods at ~335 = 1005) PLUS the ghost inventory (1775), totaling 2780. However, I must also account for the P35 order (432) which is still within a reasonable arrival window. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to 2780 to ensure the backend recognizes a deficit despite the stuck units. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2 periods, though it fluctuates between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments) is 1775 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, and P27. These units are permanently stuck in the pipeline and must be offset by an inflated mu_hat to allow the OR backend to place new orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer remains in its peak autumn regime. Since Period 27, average demand has been approximately 324 units per period (P27-P38). The current date is November 4th, suggesting the peak season will likely continue for several more weeks. In-transit inventory is currently 2,454 units. However, based on extensive history, a significant portion of this is 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) that never arrived. These include: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), P24 (221), and P27 (386), totaling 1,775 units. Additionally, the order from P35 (432 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the total estimated ghost inventory to 2,207 units. The legitimate pipeline is only the P38 order (247 units). To allow the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (\u03bc * (L+1)) for a 3-period window (L=2) using the peak demand (~324) and add the 2,207 ghost units to offset the pipeline deduction: (324 * 3) + 2207 = 3179. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the higher volatility of the peak season (P27 onwards).

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (confirmed/likely lost shipments) has increased to 2,207 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, and now P35 (4 periods overdue). These units are permanently blocking the replenishment logic and must be offset in mu_hat. Peak demand regime (P27-P38) average is ~324 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer remains in its peak autumn regime. Since Period 27, the average demand is approximately 317 units per period (P27-P39). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 3,233 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), P24 (221), P27 (386), and P35 (432). These lost orders total 2,207 units. The legitimate pipeline includes P38 (247) and P39 (779), totaling 1,026 units. To allow the OR backend to place an order when its perceived pipeline (3,233) exceeds the base stock, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset the 2,207 ghost units. Calculated mu_hat for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at 317 units/period is ~951. Adding the 2,207 ghost units gives a target mu_hat of 3,158. Lead time remains volatile but averages 2. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the backend calculation and force the offset.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) has increased to 2,207 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, and P35 (now 5 periods overdue). Peak demand regime (P27-P39) average is ~317 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status (Period 41): On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for this blazer SKU remains in its autumn peak regime (average ~314 units since P27). The primary challenge is 'ghost inventory'\u2014lost shipments that remain in the 'In-transit' count, preventing the OR backend from ordering. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), P13(153), P17(211), P24(221), P27(386), and P35(432). P38(247) is also likely lost or severely delayed (3 periods past order). This totals 2,454 units of ghost inventory. The current 'In-transit' is 3301. Legitimate pipeline is likely only P39(779) and P40(68), totaling 847 units. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the ghost inventory. Estimated Peak Demand (L+1) = 3 periods * 314 = 942 units. mu_hat = 942 + 2454 = 3396. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the backend's standard calculation which doesn't account for these losses. Sigma is set high to reflect lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (confirmed/likely lost shipments) has increased to 2,454 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35, and P38 (now 3 periods overdue). This severely blocks replenishment and must be offset in mu_hat.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter season for women's tailoring (blazers). Average demand from Period 27 to 41 is approximately 312 units. The critical issue is the accumulation of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) which totals 2,454 units: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), P24 (221), P27 (386), P35 (432), and P36 (247). Note that P36 arrived in P37, but P35 is now 7 periods overdue and clearly lost. P38 and P39 arrived in P41. P40 (68 units) and P41 (234 units) are currently in-transit and likely legitimate. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (2,509) from the base stock calculation, and 2,454 of those units will never arrive, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that offsets these ghost units. Formula: target_base_stock + ghost_inventory. Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at ~312 units/period is ~936. Adding 2,454 ghost units results in a mu_hat of ~3390. This bypasses the logic-lock and allows replenishment to meet actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (confirmed/likely lost shipments) has increased to 2,454 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35, and now P36 is suspect (Wait, P36 arrived). Recalculated: P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), P13(153), P17(211), P24(221), P27(386), P35(432), P40(68) is pending, P41(234) is pending. Lost units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35 = 2,207 units. These must be offset in mu_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2650.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we saw a massive demand spike to 733 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact). The current demand regime (since P27) averages ~326 units, but recent volatility and seasonal peaks must be captured. Lead times remain highly volatile, with recent arrivals occurring at L=1 and L=3. Most importantly, the 'In-transit' figure of 2512 units is heavily inflated by 2207 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35). To enable the OR backend to order, mu_hat must be set to explicitly include the expected demand plus the ghost inventory offset. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=2) = (1+2)*350 + Z*sigma \u2248 1050 + Safety Stock. To offset 2207 lost units, mu_hat must be approximately 1050 + 2207 = 3257. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure replenishment is not blocked by ghost inventory while preparing for the December holiday demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed in P42 (733 units) consistent with late-November retail peaks. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 2207 units: P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), P13(153), P17(211), P24(221), P27(386), P35(432). These units are permanently blocking replenishment and require mu_hat offsets.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 44 (Dec 9). Demand in P42 spiked to 733 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact) then moderated to 169 in P43. Historical December demand for blazers typically remains active but may soften as the month progresses. The main challenge is the 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 2,207 units: P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), P13(153), P17(211), P24(221), P27(386), and P35(432). These units are recorded as 'In-transit' in the backend but will never arrive. The total In-transit reported is 3,219, meaning the real pipeline consists of P40(68), P41(arrived), P42(237), and P43(707), totaling 1,012 units (matching 3219 - 2207). To bypass the backend's capped policy which prevents orders when pipeline is high, I must set mu_hat to cover both expected demand and the ghost inventory. Expected demand for (L+1) periods (L=2) is approx 3 * 250 = 750. Total mu_hat = 750 (demand) + 2207 (offset) = 2957. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 2207 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35. These units are permanently inflating the pipeline inventory and must be offset in mu_hat to allow the OR backend to order.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 16 (P45). Demand for the Mariette Blazer saw a massive spike in late November (P42: 733 units) but has since moderated (P43: 169, P44: 304). The autumn/winter peak regime (P27 onwards) remains active. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) is the primary obstacle. Following the calculation in Carry-over Insights, the confirmed lost orders are P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), P13(153), P17(211), P24(221), P27(386), and P35(432), totaling 2207 units. These units are permanently included in the OR backend's pipeline inventory count, which prevents it from placing new orders. To fix this, I must use 'mu_hat: explicit' to artificially inflate the target base stock. The target calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. With L=2 and an estimated peak demand of ~315 units/period, the target base stock should be (3 * 315) + 2207 = 3152. I will set mu_hat to 3152 and use sigma_hat: recent_N (N=18, covering the peak regime since P27) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 2207 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35. These units must be accounted for as a constant offset in mu_hat calculations to bypass the backend pipeline block.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), we are in the high-demand season for the Mariette Blazer, though demand has tapered slightly from the late November peak (733 in P42) to an average of ~244 units over the last 3 periods. The critical challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' \u2013 lost shipments that never arrived but remain in the OR backend's pipeline inventory count. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (207), P2 (236), P10 (287), P11 (74), P13 (153), P17 (211), P24 (221), P27 (386), and P35 (432). Total ghost inventory = 2207 units. Currently, the legitimate pipeline includes orders from P43 (707 units) and P45 (323 units), totaling 1030 units. The system reports In-transit as 3305 units, confirming 3305 - 1030 = 2275 units are 'ghosts' (close to our 2207 estimate). To allow the OR backend to order, I must offset these ~2275 ghost units using the mu_hat parameter. I will set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Ghost Offset. Expected demand is ~250. With L=2, mu_hat = (250 * 3) + 2275 = 3025. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock higher than the inflated pipeline, triggering necessary replenishment for the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) is ~2275 units: P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35, and likely P40 (68). These units are permanently stuck in the pipeline and must be offset by an inflated mu_hat to allow the OR backend to place new orders. Peak season demand has stabilized around 250 units/period post-November spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized post-November spike, with Period 46 showing 128 units, consistent with a post-holiday lull. Average peak season demand (P27-P46) is approximately 300 units, but recent weeks (P43-P46) average around 214 units. A total of 2,275 units (P1, P2, P10, P11, P13, P17, P24, P27, P35, P40) are confirmed or highly likely lost, remaining in the 'In-transit' count (2,598). This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the desired base stock. With L=2, mu_hat represents 3 periods of demand. I calculate the target base stock (approx 3 * 220 = 660) and add the 2,275 lost units to arrive at an explicit mu_hat of 2935. This ensures the backend sees (mu_hat - pipeline) as a positive number. I will use a high explicit sigma_hat to maintain a safety buffer against lead time volatility, which has ranged from 1 to 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) is confirmed at 2275 units: P1(207), P2(236), P10(287), P11(74), P13(153), P17(211), P24(221), P27(386), P35(432), and P40(68). These units are permanently stuck in the pipeline and must be offset by an inflated mu_hat to allow the OR backend to place new orders. Peak season demand is tapering off as of late December.
