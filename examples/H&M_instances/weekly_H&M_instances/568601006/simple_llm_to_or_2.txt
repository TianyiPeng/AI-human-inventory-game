======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: The demand over the last 5 periods (representing the lead-up to the current period) has shown a slight upward trajectory (161 to 196) before a minor dip to 186, averaging 173.4. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Factors: The date is Feb 11, 2019. This is the transition period from late winter to early spring. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Womens Tailoring/Dressed), this product is highly relevant for 'New Season' professional wardrobes and upcoming spring occasions. Demand typically increases in mid-February as consumers shop for transition wear. 3. Trend Analysis: There is a general upward trend compared to the start of the historical sequence, suggesting growing interest as the spring season approaches. 4. Forecast Logic: Given the proximity to Valentine's Day and the seasonal shift toward office/tailored wear in February, I expect demand to stay robust and slightly exceed the recent average of 173, likely returning toward the 180-195 range observed in the most recent peak.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical pattern summary: The training data shows a fluctuating demand between 145 and 196 units (average ~173). 2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The date 2019/02/18 follows the observed Period 1 (2019/02/11). This is mid-February, typically a transition period into Spring/Summer collections for women's tailoring (Blazers). 3) Recent trend analysis: Period 1 observed demand was 227 units, which is a significant jump (+26%) above the highest training point (196). This suggests a strong upward momentum likely driven by the arrival of the spring shopping season. 4) Final forecast logic: Given the jump in Period 1 to 227, I expect demand to remain elevated as the season picks up, though perhaps stabilizing slightly after the initial surge. I will forecast a slight increase to 235 units reflecting the positive momentum.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The initial training demand for the Mariette Blazer was relatively stable, averaging 173 units (range 145-196). 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: Late February marks the transition into the Spring fashion season. As a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, demand typically increases as consumers refresh workwear and formal wardrobes for the new season. 3. Recent Trend: Since entering the test phase, there has been a sharp and sustained upward shift. Demand rose from 227 (Period 1) to 284 (Period 2), representing a significant increase over the training average. 4. Final Forecast Logic: The current trend shows strong momentum (+25% in the last week). Given the date (Feb 25) aligns with peak spring shopping, I expect demand to continue climbing. I am forecasting a further increase to 335 units, maintaining the upward trajectory seen over the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 1: demand increased from training average of 173 to current levels above 250 (+45% increase), coinciding with Spring season onset.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 173.4 units. Since moving into the 'Test Phase' (February), we have seen a significant shift in the demand regime. Period 1 and 2 showed a sharp increase (227 and 284 units), likely tied to the beginning of the Spring retail season for a tailored blazer. Period 3 (Feb 25) saw a pull-back to 198 units, which is still 14% higher than the original training average but lower than the mid-February peak. The current date is March 4th, entering the peak 'Womens Tailoring' season as professional wardrobes refresh for Spring. Given the recent average of the last three periods is 236 units and the slight dip in Period 3, I expect a moderate recovery as March shopping behaviors stabilize.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173 units. Since the transition to the Spring season (starting Period 1), demand shifted to a higher range, though recent weeks (Periods 3 and 4) show a stabilization and slight cooling from the Period 2 peak of 284. The current date (March 11) is mid-Spring, a prime season for women's tailoring/blazers. Period 3 (198) and Period 4 (214) show a consistent baseline above the historical training average but lower than the initial surge. Given the product category's high relevance in March and the slight upward movement from Period 3 to 4, I expect demand to remain steady or slightly increase as Spring fashion peaks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173. Since the start of the test period (Spring season), demand shifted upward. While Period 2 saw a peak of 284, demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P3: 198, P4: 214, P5: 215), averaging 209. This indicates a sustained new baseline that is approximately 20% higher than the training average. Given the current date of March 18th (mid-Spring) and the consistent performance of the 'Mariette Blazer' in recent weeks, I expect demand to remain stable with a slight positive bias as the season peaks. The forecast is set at 218, reflecting the recent stabilization around the 215 mark.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: After an initial Spring spike, demand has settled into a new regime averaging 210 units (Periods 3-5), representing a sustained 21% increase over the training average of 173.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand showed an initial increase in the early spring (Periods 1-2) before stabilizing. The last three periods (Period 4: 214, Period 5: 215, Period 6: 215) demonstrate remarkable stability in demand. As of March 25, the product is in its peak seasonal window for spring tailoring, but there are no major calendar events or shifts in the recent data to suggest a deviation from this established baseline. Given the identical demand of 215 units over the last two weeks, the forecast assumes a continuation of this plateau.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training period averaged 173. Upon entering the spring season (Test Periods 1-7), demand shifted upwards, peaking in mid-February and then stabilizing at a plateau of approximately 215 units between Periods 4 and 6. Period 7 showed a decline to 186 units. Given the current date is April 1st, a key time for spring fashion and transitional outerwear like the Mariette Blazer, demand is expected to remain significantly above the training average. The forecast predicts a slight recovery from the Period 7 dip, settling near the recent three-week average (205) as the spring season continues.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173 units. Since entering the test phase, the product (a blazer) has seen a sustained increase. Periods 1-6 showed a 'Spring spike' averaging around 225 units. Period 7 saw a dip to 186, while Period 8 jumped significantly to 249. This recent spike in Period 8 (April 1st) aligns with the peak of the Spring tailoring season and potentially pre-Easter shopping (Easter 2019 was April 21). Given the current date is April 8th, demand is expected to remain high as the season peaks. The average of the last three periods (7-8) is 217.5. Considering the upward momentum in Period 8 and the seasonal relevance of a fitted blazer in early April, I forecast a slight normalization from the recent peak but maintaining a high level.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a volatile but generally elevated pattern compared to the training average (173). Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: Period 7 (186), Period 8 (249), and Period 9 (178). The average of the last three periods is 204.3, which aligns closely with the previously identified 'stabilization' average of 210. Current date (2019/4/15) is mid-Spring, typically a strong period for women's tailoring (blazers) as weather transitions and professional/social events increase. The drop in Period 9 (178) follows a spike in Period 8 (249), suggesting a compensatory correction or temporary lull rather than a downward trend. Given the product's seasonal relevance and the mean-reverting behavior around the 205-215 range, I expect demand to recover toward the regime average.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173 units. During the test phase, demand initially spiked in Feb/March (averaging 225 units), but recent data shows a distinct downward trend. Specifically, the last three periods (8, 9, 10) have shown a steady decline from 249 to 178 to 130. The current date is 2019/4/22, which is the Monday after Easter Sunday (April 21, 2019). Historically, retail demand for formal attire like blazers often dips significantly immediately following the Easter holiday, as the peak shopping period for spring events and holiday outfits has passed. Given the sharp drop to 130 in Period 10 (Easter week) and the post-holiday lull, a further slight stabilization or minor decline is expected before demand reverts to its long-term baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a late-March peak of 249 to 130 in Period 10 (-47%), indicating a sharp seasonal cooldown for tailored workwear following the holiday peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer showed a significant peak in late March/early April (Period 8: 249 units), likely driven by pre-Easter shopping and the start of the spring workwear season. Following the Easter holiday (which fell on April 21, 2019), demand has experienced a sharp decline as indicated by the most recent periods: Period 10 (130) and Period 11 (127). The date for the current forecast (Period 12) is April 29, 2019, which marks the transition into May. Typically, demand for heavy tailored blazers begins to cool further as temperatures rise, and the recent stabilization at the ~130 level suggests a new lower-demand regime for the post-holiday spring period. I expect demand to remain relatively flat or slightly decline as the immediate seasonal need for this specific blazer profile wanes.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a distinct seasonal pattern. After a significant post-Easter slump in Periods 10 and 11 (averaging 128 units), Period 12 showed a strong recovery to 191 units (+50% from the previous week). The current date is May 6, which typically marks the start of a stable demand period for spring tailoring and transitional workwear. The Period 12 rebound suggests a return to the previously established spring baseline (approximately 180-210 units). Given the momentum from Period 12 and the lack of immediate holiday disruptions in early May, I expect demand to continue its recovery towards the 200-unit level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (173 avg) and early test data (avg ~210) showed a peak for spring tailoring. However, as documented in Period 11, demand dropped significantly post-Easter (avg 128.5 in Periods 10-11). Periods 12 and 13 show a slight recovery (avg 175.5) as we move further into May, likely due to mid-season promotions or late-spring social events. Current date 2019/5/13 is mid-May, past the initial spring surge but before the summer slump. The demand seems to be mean-reverting toward the original baseline of ~170. Based on the recent two-period average (175.5) and the gentle decline from Period 12 to 13, a forecast near the 150-160 range is appropriate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history for the Mariette Blazer shows three distinct phases: a high Spring onset (avg ~210), a sharp post-Easter decline in late April (avg ~128), and a recent May recovery. Over the last three periods (P12-P14), demand has risen to 191, 160, and 196 respectively, averaging approximately 182 units. This suggests the product has moved out of its seasonal trough and is stabilizing near its original training levels (173) and the early Spring baseline as the season progresses into late May. Given the strong performance in Period 14 (196), I anticipate demand will remain steady near the upper end of the recent recovery range.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Following the post-Easter trough (Periods 10-11), demand has rebounded to an average of 182 units over Periods 12-14, representing a 42% increase from the low point.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training demand averaged 173. In the test phase, demand saw a Spring peak (avg 210) followed by a sharp post-Easter slump (approx 130). A subsequent recovery was observed in early May (Periods 12-14) with an average of 182. However, Period 15 showed a significant drop to 143 units. As of May 27th (Period 16), the product (Mariette Blazer) is transitioning into the summer season where tailoring often sees fluctuating demand due to weather sensitivity and holiday weekends (Memorial Day). Given the recent volatility, the forecast is calculated by weighting the recovery average (182) against the most recent lower observation (143) and the 4-period moving average (172.5). A conservative estimate of 165 reflects a moderation of the early May recovery trend.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows high sensitivity to seasonal shifts. Following a post-Easter recovery phase (Periods 12-14) where demand averaged 182, the last two periods (15-16) have seen a slight cooling, averaging 155.5 units. As of June 3 (Period 17), the market is entering the transition from Spring workwear into Summer, where structured blazers typically see a gradual decline in demand due to warmer weather. The recent trend (143, 168) suggests stabilization around the 150-170 range rather than the higher May average. Given the date is early June, a slight downward pressure is expected as seasonal interest shifts toward lighter apparel, though the professional nature of the item maintains a baseline demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a distinct seasonal pattern for this blazer. After a spring peak and a post-Easter recovery (averaging 182 in P12-14), demand has entered a downward trend as June begins. Recent observations for Periods 15-17 (143, 168, 118) show a significant drop, with Period 17 reaching a new seasonal low. This aligns with the transition into warmer summer months where demand for structured, lined tailored jackets typically decreases. The forecast for Period 18 (June 10) anticipates a continuation of this lower demand level, likely hovering near the recent average of the last three periods while accounting for the downward momentum seen in the most recent week.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand decline confirmed: Average demand has shifted from 182 (Periods 12-14) to 143 (Periods 15-17), a 21% decrease, indicating the start of the summer seasonal low for tailored workwear.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailored blazer peaked during the Spring/Easter period (reaching up to 249) and has since trended downwards as the season transitions into Summer. The most recent periods (P15-P18) show demand stabilizing at a lower level with an average of 142 units (143, 168, 118, 139). Mid-June (2019/06/17) typically represents a seasonal low for structured tailoring in retail as consumer interest shifts toward vacation and leisure wear. The forecast for P19 anticipates demand will continue to track near the current four-week average of 142, reflecting the sustained summer decline noted in previous insights.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for the Mariette Blazer. After a Spring peak (Feb/Mar) and a brief May recovery, demand has entered a sustained summer decline. The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show demand levels of 118, 139, and 122, resulting in a 3-period average of 126.3. This is a step down from the 143 average recorded in the previous block (P15-P17). Given the current date of June 24th, we are entering the peak summer period where demand for structured tailoring typically hits its seasonal floor. The forecast for Period 20 anticipates continued low demand aligned with the most recent 3-period average.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear downward trajectory for this tailored blazer as the summer season progresses. After a recovery in May (Periods 12-14 avg: 182), demand entered a 'Summer decline' phase (Periods 15-19 avg: 138). The most recent observation (Period 20) shows a sharp drop to 73 units, the lowest recorded value. This aligns with typical retail patterns for structured workwear in late June/early July, as consumer focus shifts toward vacation-wear and light summer clothing. Given the consistent decline over the last four periods (168, 118, 139, 122) followed by the sudden drop to 73, I expect demand to remain at this low seasonal floor for Period 21 (July 1st) before any eventual late-summer clearance or fall-transition activity begins.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand floor confirmed: Demand for tailored workwear has reached a seasonal low in late June/early July, dropping significantly from the June average of ~138 to 73 units in Period 20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern for the Mariette Blazer. After a strong Spring (averaging ~210 units) and a moderate May recovery (~182 units), demand has entered a significant summer lull. The most recent periods (P20-P21) show demand hitting a seasonal floor, dropping from the mid-130s to an average of 94.5 units. Specifically, P20 recorded 73 units and P21 recovered slightly to 116 units. Given the date (July 8th) is in the middle of the summer vacation period when demand for structured tailoring typically stays suppressed, I expect demand to remain within this lower regime. My forecast of 110 reflects a slight stabilization around the current low-demand floor established in the last two weeks.

The most recent two periods (P21: 116, P22: 120) indicate a stabilization or slight recovery from that absolute floor, although demand remains significantly lower than the Spring average (~225) or the late Spring/early Summer average (~140-160). As of July 15, the market is still in the summer holiday lull, meaning a significant 'Back to Work' surge is unlikely for at least another 3-4 weeks. Therefore, the forecast for Period 23 assumes demand will remain within the current stabilized range observed over the last two weeks, with a very marginal upward drift as the market slowly moves away from the July minimum.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant seasonal decline for this tailored blazer during the summer months, reaching a trough of 73 units in late June (Period 20). Following this seasonal low, demand has stabilized over the last three periods (21-23) with observations of 116, 120, and 120 respectively. This indicates a consistent mid-summer baseline. Given the stability over the last two weeks and the absence of major calendar triggers in late July, the forecast predicts a continuation of this stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Following the seasonal low in Period 20, demand has established a new mid-summer floor averaging 119 units over Periods 21-23, representing a recovery from the trough but remaining ~16% below the June average of 143.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows significant seasonal volatility. Following a spring peak (averaging ~210 units) and a summer decline, the demand reached a mid-summer plateau of approximately 119 units (Periods 21-23). However, Period 24 (July 22) saw a sharp drop to 63 units, which mirrors the drop seen in Period 20 (73 units). These end-of-month troughs in June and July likely reflect peak vacation periods or the tail end of summer clearance cycles. Based on the recovery observed after Period 20 (where demand jumped from 73 to 116), I anticipate a similar partial recovery for Period 25 as the market transitions toward August, though demand will remain constrained by the summer season. I am forecasting a return toward the recent mean of ~110 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical summary: Demand for this blazer fluctuated between 130-190 in late spring before dropping to a summer trough. (2) Seasonal consideration: The current date (Aug 5) marks the beginning of the 'Back-to-Office' and Pre-Fall transition. For tailored workwear like blazers, demand typically begins to recover from mid-summer lows during this window. (3) Recent trend: After hitting a secondary trough of 63 in Period 24, Period 25 saw an increase to 94 (+49%). (4) Final forecast logic: Following the upward movement from the late-July low and anticipating the early August seasonal shift toward workwear, I predict a continued recovery toward the previous stabilization levels (approx. 110-120).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is showing a clear upward trend as we move into August, signaling the start of the 'back-to-work' seasonal recovery. Following a mid-summer trough (63 units in Period 24), demand has increased for two consecutive weeks (94 in Period 25 and 146 in Period 26). This aligns with the transition from summer holiday wear to professional tailoring for the autumn season. Given the momentum (+55% increase in the most recent period) and historical levels for this product category outside of the summer lull, I expect demand to continue rising toward the 170-190 range. I am forecasting 178 units, reflecting continued seasonal strengthening.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn recovery confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods from the seasonal low in Period 24 (63 to 146), signaling the start of the back-to-work seasonal uptick for tailored blazers.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern related to professional tailoring. After a mid-summer seasonal low (trough of 63 in Period 24), demand has surged for three consecutive periods (94, 146, 301). The jump in Period 27 (Aug 12) to 301 units (+106% from the previous week) indicates the start of the peak 'Back-to-Work' and early autumn transition season. Period 28 (Aug 19) is situated in the height of this retail window. Given the sharp momentum and the product's relevance to office-wear restarts in late August, demand is expected to remain at this elevated level or slightly increase as consumers finalize autumn wardrobes. I am forecasting a slight continued increase to 325, reflecting the peak intensity of the seasonal shift before it likely stabilizes or tapers in September.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-work peak confirmed: Period 27 demand (301) exceeded the previous spring peak (284), marking a significant seasonal regime shift with a 100%+ week-over-week increase in August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its 'back-to-work' seasonal peak. Historical data shows a massive surge starting in early August, peaking at 301 units in Period 27 (Aug 12) and slightly tapering to 251 units in Period 28 (Aug 19). This pattern mirrors the spring peak but with higher intensity. As we reach the final week of August (Period 29), demand is expected to remain significantly elevated compared to the summer floor but continue a gradual stabilization from the initial peak surge. I forecast a slight further decrease as the primary shopping rush for the new season plateaus.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal 'back-to-work' surge beginning in mid-August (Period 27), where demand peaked at 301 units. In the subsequent two periods, demand has seen a controlled deceleration (251 and 231), dropping 16.6% then 8.0% respectively. This mirrors the Spring pattern where an initial spike was followed by stabilization. Given that Period 30 (Sept 2) is the height of the early Autumn office-wear season, demand is expected to stabilize further. The current 3-period average is 261 units, but the downward trajectory suggests a value slightly below the most recent observation (231), settling toward a sustainable high-season baseline similar to the Spring plateau (approx. 215).

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime shift confirmed: Demand has increased from a mid-summer average of 119 to a post-peak average of 261 (+119%) over the last three periods (27-29), establishing a new high-season baseline for tailored workwear.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong 'Back-to-Work' seasonal regime shift starting in mid-August (Period 27). After an initial peak of 301 and a brief stabilization in the 230-250 range (Periods 28-29), Period 30 saw a significant surge to 357 units, coinciding with the first week of September. This aligns with peak demand for tailored blazers as professional wardrobes are refreshed for autumn. Given the high volatility in this peak season, a slight cooling from the 357 peak is expected, similar to the pattern seen after Period 27, while remaining well above the previous 261-unit average. I am forecasting a stabilization around the 300-unit mark to reflect sustained high seasonal demand.

Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a strong seasonal recovery starting in late August, aligning with the 'back-to-work' autumn season. Recent demand in Periods 30 and 31 (357 and 328 units respectively) indicates a significant surge well above the previously established autumn baseline of 261. Mid-September typically represents a peak period for tailored workwear as temperatures drop and professional wardrobes are updated. Given the slight cooling from Period 30 to 31 but the sustained high volume, I expect demand to remain robust, stabilizing near the recent two-week average.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has entered a high-volume autumn phase. Recent demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has stabilized at a significantly higher level, averaging 342 units (357, 328, 341), compared to the previous autumn peak average of 261 noted in Period 30. As of late September (2019/09/23), the product is in its peak seasonal relevance for back-to-work tailoring. Given the consistency of the last three weeks, I expect demand to remain stable within the 330-350 range.

Carry-over insight: High-autumn demand ceiling confirmed: Demand has stabilized at a new peak average of 342 units over Periods 30-32, representing a 31% increase over the initial autumn recovery average of 261.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant autumn regime shift starting in late August. Demand stabilized at a high-season baseline average of 342 units between Periods 30 and 32. However, Period 33 saw a massive spike to 612 units (+79% over the previous average), likely driven by a month-end promotional event, payday weekend, or a mid-season sale peak for tailored workwear. For Period 34 (Sept 30 - Oct 6), demand is expected to remain high but likely retreat from the extreme Period 33 peak as the initial surge of a promotion or monthly cycle cools down. I anticipate demand will settle between the established high-autumn baseline (~340) and the recent spike (~600), centering around 480 units to account for sustained seasonal momentum and early October shopping behavior.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer is currently in its autumn peak season. Analysis of recent periods shows a clear regime shift: after a mid-summer low, demand stabilized around 342 units (Periods 30-32). Period 33 saw a significant outlier spike to 612 units, likely due to a month-end promotion or payday event in late September. Period 34 (313 units) shows demand returning to the established high-autumn baseline. For Period 35 (Oct 7), I expect demand to remain consistent with this high-season average (approx. 310-340 range) as the weather continues to cool, maintaining the need for tailored outerwear, though without the promotional surge seen in Period 33.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the 'Mariette Blazer' reached a seasonal peak in September, with a stable high-autumn average of 342 units (Periods 30-32) and a massive one-off spike to 612 units in Period 33. Following this spike, demand has cooled for two consecutive periods (313 in Period 34 and 283 in Period 35), representing a ~17% decline from the pre-spike ceiling. This suggests the initial autumn/back-to-work surge is subsiding as we move into mid-October. Given the current downward trajectory (a 10% week-over-week drop from P34 to P35), I expect demand to continue softening slightly toward the previous late-August levels (~260-270 range) as the market stabilizes before potential late-season promotions.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has passed its high-autumn peak (Periods 30-33). Following the outlier spike of 612 in Period 33, demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 293 units over the last three periods (313, 283, 282). This represents a 14% decline from the previous peak average of 342 units. As we move into late October, the 'back-to-work' seasonal surge typically cools as consumers shift towards heavier outerwear. Recent observations (283, 282) suggest a new plateau in the high 280s. Therefore, the forecast for Period 37 anticipates a continuation of this stable, slightly cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization confirmed: Demand has decreased from the high-autumn average of 342 to 293 over the last 3 periods (Periods 34-36), a 14% decline signaling the end of the primary autumn surge.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the outlier spike in Period 33 (612 units), demand has stabilized in a post-peak autumn regime. Over the last four periods (34-37), demand has consistently ranged between 282 and 313 units, with an average of 297.75. The current date (late October) is past the primary 'back-to-work' surge but precedes the shift toward winter/holiday wear. Given the stability over the last month and the slight uptick in the most recent period (313), I expect demand to remain consistent with this established baseline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the post-peak stabilization around 290 units (Periods 34-36), demand has shown a clear upward trajectory over the last three periods (282, 313, and 385). This 36% increase from Period 36 to 38 suggests the onset of a new demand driver, likely associated with the 'holiday dressing' season and professional year-end events where tailored 'dressed' blazers are in high demand. Period 39 (starting Nov 4) is the week preceding Single's Day and the start of the November retail push, suggesting demand will continue to strengthen or maintain its current momentum. The forecast of 405 reflects a continued upward trend building on the 385 units observed in Period 38.

Carry-over insight: Pre-holiday demand surge confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (282, 313, 385), rising 31% above the previous stabilization average of 293 units, signaling the start of the end-of-year seasonal peak for tailored blazers.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong upward trend from Period 36 to Period 38 (282 to 385), which was identified as a pre-holiday surge. However, Period 39 (2019/11/04) saw a sharp drop to 231 units (-40%). This drop likely represents a typical 'calm before the storm' as consumers wait for Black Friday / Singles' Day promotions. Current Period 40 (2019/11/11) is the week of Singles' Day (11/11), a major global retail event, and leads into the ramp-up for Black Friday. Given the product is a 'Dressed' blazer suitable for holiday parties and work events, a significant rebound is expected. The forecast assumes demand will return to the pre-drop level seen in Period 38, factoring in the calendar-driven shopping activity around November 11.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is currently in its late-autumn/pre-holiday phase. Historically, the demand for this tailored item saw a significant surge in Period 38 (385 units), followed by a sharp correction in Period 39 (231 units). Period 40 (278 units) showed a recovery of approximately 20% from that dip, indicating that the baseline demand remains strong as we enter the week of November 18th. Given that the upcoming period (Period 41) precedes the Black Friday retail week (typically starting around Nov 25th in 2019), demand is expected to accelerate further as consumers prepare for holiday events and take advantage of early seasonal promotions. The forecast logic anticipates a continued upward trajectory from the Period 40 rebound, moving back toward the established high-autumn average of 290-310 units identified in previous insights.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals that SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) experienced a major autumn peak in late September (Period 33: 612 units) followed by stabilization around 280-310 units. A pre-holiday surge was noted in Period 38 (385 units), but the last three periods (39-41) have shown a slight cooling trend, averaging 251 units (231, 278, 245). Period 42 (2019/11/25) coincides with the Black Friday retail week. Given the product category (womens tailoring/dressed), a significant seasonal spike is expected as consumers shop for holiday events and take advantage of promotional events. While demand recently dipped below 250, the Black Friday effect typically drives a 30-50% increase over the immediate prior week. Applying a conservative but significant seasonal lift to the Period 41 demand of 245, I anticipate a return to the 340-360 range.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime for this blazer: (1) A baseline of ~250 units in late November (Periods 39-41). (2) A massive spike in Period 42 (733 units), which corresponds to the Black Friday sales week (Nov 25 - Dec 1, 2019). (3) Current Period 43 (starting Dec 2) covers Cyber Monday and the immediate post-Black Friday period. Historically, following extreme spikes like the one seen in Period 33 (612 units), demand corrected back to the established seasonal baseline (~300 units). I expect a similar correction for Period 43, though demand will likely remain slightly elevated due to holiday shopping and Cyber Monday residuals compared to the pre-spike average of 251.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) experienced a massive outlier spike in Period 42 (733 units), coinciding with the Black Friday promotional week, followed by a sharp 'hangover' drop in Period 43 (169 units) as demand was likely exhausted. Period 44 (Dec 9) represents a stabilization phase in early December. Historically, after promotional shocks, demand tends to regress toward the recent pre-spike baseline. Given that the pre-holiday surge average (Periods 40-41) was approximately 261 units and the product is a tailored 'dressed' item, demand is expected to recover from the post-Black Friday trough but remain below the high-autumn peak as consumer focus shifts toward holiday gifting and social wear. I forecast a moderate recovery toward a baseline of approximately 218 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern with a major autumn peak followed by extreme volatility during the promotional holiday season. After the Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike (Period 42: 733 units) and the subsequent post-sale hangover (Period 43: 169 units), Period 44 saw a strong recovery to 304 units as consumers returned to normalized holiday shopping levels. Current Period 45 (2019/12/16) covers the final full shopping week before Christmas. Tailored blazers are popular for festive holiday parties and end-of-year 'dressed' occasions. Given the recovery to 304 units in Period 44 and the sustained high-autumn baseline established earlier in the season (averaging ~293-342 units in Periods 30-37), demand is expected to remain firm but slightly lower than the previous week as shipping windows for holiday arrival begin to close and seasonal gift-buying peaks early in the week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of the Mariette Blazer shows distinct seasonal volatility. After a significant Black Friday spike (733 units in Period 42) followed by a sharp correction (169 units in Period 43), demand has stabilized in the mid-to-high 200s (304 in Period 44 and 258 in Period 45). The current period (Period 46) corresponds to the week of December 23rd (Christmas week). Historically, retail demand for non-gift tailored workwear often experiences a deceleration during the Christmas-to-New-Year transition as professional dressing needs decline and consumer focus shifts toward leisure or end-of-year clearance. Given the 15% drop from Period 44 to 45 and the holiday timing, I anticipate a further moderate reduction in demand as the market enters the final week of the year.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Mariette Blazer is a structured tailoring piece heavily influenced by work-life cycles and major retail events. Analysis of recent periods shows high volatility: a massive peak in Period 42 (733 units) for Black Friday, followed by a sharp drop and then a secondary pre-holiday surge in Periods 44-45 (avg. 281). Period 46 (128 units) represents the expected seasonal trough during Christmas week. Period 47 (Dec 30) encompasses New Year's Eve and the start of the New Year. While 'End of Year' clearance sales typically drive some volume, demand for tailored office wear usually remains suppressed during the holiday transition before the 'back-to-work' recovery in mid-January. I expect a slight uptick from the Christmas low as clearance activities begin, but demand will remain well below the autumn baseline of ~290.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility confirmed: Demand shifted from a stable autumn average of 293 (Periods 34-37) into a high-variance period (Periods 42-46) characterized by a Black Friday peak (+150%) and a subsequent 50% decline during the Christmas holiday week.
