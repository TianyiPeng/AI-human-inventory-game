SIMPLE LLM->OR STRATEGY (LLM as Demand Forecaster)
======================================================================


Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, typically associated with professional attire and spring fashion transitions. Historical data shows demand values of [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], which suggests a slight upward trend or at least a stable demand regime averaging approximately 173 units. The current date is February 11, 2019, which aligns with the early spring retail season when customers begin purchasing transitional pieces like blazers for work or upcoming spring events. Given the recent historical sequence ending at 186 and the upward movement from the earlier 140s/160s, a forecast slightly above the overall average but near the recent mean is appropriate. No major immediate holidays are spiking demand, but seasonal momentum is likely building.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The training data shows an average demand of 173.4 units with a slight upward trend peaking at 196. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: The product is a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer, often associated with office wear and the transition to spring fashion. Period 2 starts February 18th, entering the mid-to-late February period where spring collections typically see increased interest. (3) Recent trend analysis: Period 1 demand came in at 227 units, which is significantly higher (+30%) than the training mean of 173. This confirms a breakthrough of the previous ceiling (196). (4) Final forecast logic: Given the strong momentum in Period 1 and the seasonal alignment for professional spring attire, demand is expected to remain elevated. I will forecast a slight further increase to account for the build-up toward peak spring shopping.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for this 'Mariette Blazer' showed an average demand of 173 units (range 145-196). However, the observed demand for Period 1 (227) and Period 2 (284) indicates a significant upward trend and a regime shift compared to the training phase. Blazers often see increased demand in late February and March as consumers transition into spring 'Dressed' and 'Professional' wear. The jump from 227 to 284 (+25%) suggests momentum building as the spring season approaches. I expect demand to continue increasing slightly or stabilize at this higher level for the next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1) Historical Pattern Summary: Pre-test data showed an average of 173 units. Observed test data for Periods 1-3 shows a significantly higher average of 236 units, indicating a volume shift coinciding with the start of the spring season. 2) Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: The date 2019/3/4 marks the beginning of March. As a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring/Dressed), demand is currently driven by the spring transition and 'workwear' refreshes. 3) Recent Trend Analysis: Period 2 saw a spike to 284 followed by a correction to 198 in Period 3. Despite the dip, the level remains above the original training average. 4) Final Forecast Logic: Expecting demand to stabilize as the early spring surge continues. Given the volatility (227 -> 284 -> 198), a forecast near the recent average (236) is appropriate, adjusted slightly for the early March trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (Feb-March): average demand increased from ~173 to ~236 (+36%) coinciding with spring seasonal launch.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear shift in average demand starting in February. The previous 'Carry-Over Insight' suggests a regime shift to a higher average of ~236 units. Analyzing the 4 most recent periods (227, 284, 198, 214), the moving average is 230.75 units. Period 5 (2019/3/11) falls squarely in the mid-March spring retail season, where demand for tailored 'dressed' items like a blazer typically stabilizes or slightly increases. While Period 3 and 4 showed a slight dip from the Period 2 peak, they remain well above historical training levels (~173). Given the current date and the product category, I expect demand to track closely with the recent regime average, possibly showing a slight recovery as spring shopping intensifies.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift from the training average of ~173 to a higher test phase average of ~228. After a spike in Period 2 (284), demand has stabilized in the most recent periods (P4: 214, P5: 215), suggesting a plateau. The product is a tailored blazer, which is highly relevant for the mid-March Spring season (2019/03/18). Given the extreme stability between the last two weeks, the forecast maintains this level with a very slight upward adjustment to account for peak Spring seasonality for business-casual attire.

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for the Mariette Blazer underwent a regime shift at the start of the spring season (Period 1), moving from a training average of ~173 to a higher test average. After an initial peak in mid-February (Period 2: 284), demand has entered an exceptionally stable phase. The last three periods (P4: 214, P5: 215, P6: 215) show almost zero variance, indicating a firm plateau as the spring season continues. Given this high stability and the lack of major calendar disruptions for the week of March 25, 2019, I expect the demand to remain at this level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~215 units (+24% vs training avg) following the initial seasonal spike in February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173. Starting from Period 1 (Feb 11), demand shifted upward to a new regime, averaging ~215 over the last 7 periods (an increase of ~24%). Period 7 (March 25) saw a drop to 186 units, which likely reflects a post-launch cooling or month-end fluctuation rather than a full reversal of the spring season trend. As we enter Period 8 (April 1), demand for a 'Womens Tailoring' blazer typically remains stable or sees a slight uptick as professional spring wardrobes are refreshed. Given the recent stabilization around 215 but accounting for the recent dip to 186, I expect a slight recovery toward the 200-210 range.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training phase averaged 173 units. Since the start of the test phase (Feb 2019), demand shifted upward, averaging ~225 units between Period 1 and Period 6. Period 7 saw a temporary dip to 186, followed by a sharp rebound in Period 8 to 249 units. This recent spike (April 1st) likely reflects the 'Spring/Easter' peak for women's tailoring (fitted blazers) as customers shop for spring events and professional updates. Given the date (April 8th), we are still in the peak spring shopping window. Period 8's surge (249) indicates high immediate momentum, though it may stabilize slightly as the initial April peak levels off.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. Since the transition to the 2019 season (Period 1 onwards), demand has fluctuated but established a new higher mean around 218 units. Period 8 saw a peak of 249 units (likely early April spring shopping), followed by a drop to 178 in Period 9. Given the date (April 15), we are in the peak of spring tailoring season for high-end items like a 'fitted jacket in woven fabric'. The average of the last four periods is 207 units. I expect demand to revert toward the stabilized mean of ~210-215 units after the recent dip, as mid-April remains a strong period for professional/spring occasion wear.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear peak in February and March (averaging ~215-230) followed by a sharp decline in the first two weeks of April. Specifically, demand dropped from 249 (Period 8) to 178 (Period 9) and 130 (Period 10). This downward trend coincides with the lead-up to and conclusion of the Easter holiday (April 21, 2019), a period where demand for 'Dressed' tailoring like Blazers typically peaks early for spring events and then retreats. Period 11 (April 22) is Easter Monday, marking the end of the holiday peak. While a slight rebound from the period low of 130 is possible as retail returns to normal operations, the overall trend suggests the seasonal peak has passed. I forecast a demand of 142 units, reflecting a post-holiday stabilization below the previous seasonal average.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data averaged 173 units. Test phase data showed an initial spring spike (Feb/Mar) averaging ~223 units, as noted in previous carry-over insights. However, demand in the last two periods (Period 10 and 11) has dropped significantly to 130 and 127 units respectively. This decline coincides with the post-Easter period (April 22 was Easter Monday) and a likely cooling of the initial spring tailoring demand. Given the current date is late April (2019/4/29), we are seeing a shift away from the early spring peak. While the drop to ~128 is sharp, it mirrors a seasonal correction often seen after holiday peaks. The forecast weights the most recent two periods heavily but expects a slight stabilization as the new baseline settles.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: significant post-spring peak decline from average ~215 down to ~129 (-40%), likely signaling the end of the initial seasonal launch surge.

Predicted demand: 125 units

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has transitioned from its peak spring launch phase (averaging ~215 units in Feb-Mar) to a lower baseline. Periods 10 and 11 showed a significant drop to ~128 units, but Period 12 (Apr 29) saw a rebound to 191 units. This rebound likely reflects late spring demand for 'dressed' tailoring (Womens Dressed/Tailoring category) as customers shop for May events such as graduations or professional transitions. However, the overall trend since mid-April is downward compared to the spring peak. For Period 13 (May 6), I expect demand to settle between the recent low and the Period 12 rebound, reflecting a stabilized late-spring baseline. Calculating the average of the most recent four periods (178, 130, 127, 191) results in approximately 157 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173. Following a high spring-launch peak in Feb/March (~215-236 units), demand saw a sharp decline in mid-April (Periods 10-11) to ~130 units. However, the last two periods (P12: 191, P13: 160) show a recovery toward the historical baseline. Current demand for mid-May is stabilizing around the long-term mean of 160-175 units as the initial peak seasonal surge concludes, but baseline demand for dressed tailoring remains steady. I forecast 165 units, reflecting a stabilization between the recent low and the historical training average.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training average was ~173. Following a spring peak (Periods 1-9 avg ~219), demand underwent a regime shift downwards (Periods 10-11 avg ~128). However, the most recent three periods (Periods 12-14) show a significant recovery with demands of 191, 160, and 196 (avg ~182), returning demand to levels consistent with the initial training baseline. This uptick in mid-May likely reflects demand for 'Womens Tailoring' (Mariette Blazer) driven by early summer social events (graduations, weddings) and professional wardrobe updates. Period 14 reached 196; given the consistent strength over the last 3 weeks, I expect demand to remain stable near this new local mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 12-14 show a return to baseline levels (avg ~182) from the previous Period 10-11 dip, indicating a stabilization of mid-season demand for tailoring.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a baseline of ~170-180 units. After a high-performance spring launch period (Feb-March averaging ~215), the demand has settled into a more volatile transition phase. Recent demand for the last four periods (Periods 12-15) averaged 172.5 units (191, 160, 196, 143), showing a return to the long-term baseline but with significant weekly fluctuations. The most recent observation (Period 15) dropped to 143, likely reflecting a late-May lull before potential summer interest. Given the 'Womens Tailoring' category and the late May date (approaching end of May bank holidays and early summer events), I expect demand to remain within the established 160-185 range, adjusting for the recent low point with a slight mean-reversion toward the 170 level.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer has stabilized following the post-spring recovery phase. Periods 14-16 recorded 196, 143, and 168 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 169 units. This aligns closely with the long-term historical training average of 173 units. As we enter June, tailoring typically sees a seasonal softening due to warmer weather, though demand for 'dressed' items remains relevant for summer events. Given the recent volatility between 140-190 units, the forecast weights the most recent observation (168) and the short-term average (171) to arrive at a conservative estimate for early June.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this blazer shows a tapering trend as we enter the summer season. Following a recovery to baseline in periods 12-14 (avg ~182), the demand has trended downward in the last three periods: 143, 168, and 118 (avg ~143). Period 17 (118 units) reflects a significant drop, coinciding with the shift into June, a month typically associated with less demand for structured tailoring like lined blazers compared to spring months. Given the three-week downward trend and the seasonality of a 'Fitted jacket in woven fabric', I expect demand to remain at this lower level or slightly decline further as summer clearance cycles typically begin. The forecast weights the most recent observation and the seasonal decline for heavy tailoring.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 15: Post-spring demand for tailoring has entered a secondary decline, dropping from an average of ~182 (Periods 12-14) to ~143 (Periods 15-17), a -21% decrease likely due to summer seasonality.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this fitted blazer (SKU 568601006) shows a clear seasonal pattern related to the spring/summer transition. Following the spring peak (Periods 1-9 avg: ~218), demand entered a volatile decline phase. The most recent three periods (Periods 16-18) show a sustained drop, averaging 141.6 units, compared to the Period 12-14 average of 182. Specifically, the last two observations (118, 139) reflect lower consumer interest as the calendar moves into mid-June (Current Date: 2019/6/17), where demand for structured tailoring typically softens in favor of lighter summer apparel. Given the recent average and the downward trend captured in the latest carry-over insight, I expect demand to remain in this lower regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend as we move into the peak of summer (June). Specifically, for the 'Mariette Blazer', which is a dressed, lined tailoring item, demand has shifted from an average of ~182 (Periods 12-14) to a lower regime. The most recent three periods (17, 18, 19) have recorded 118, 139, and 122 units respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 126 units. This reinforces the carry-over insight from Period 18 regarding a summer seasonality decline. Given the date (June 24th), we are in the warmest period where demand for lined blazers typically bottoms out before late-summer/autumn resets. The forecast weights the most recent three weeks heavily, anticipating continued low demand consistent with the current 120-130 unit range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 17-19 demonstrate a stabilized low-demand floor averaging ~126 units (-31% from mid-spring baseline), establishing the expected summer trough for this tailoring SKU.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the SKU '568601006' (Mariette Blazer) has entered a summer trough. The training data average was ~173. Following a spring peak, carry-over insights identified a stabilization around 126 units (Periods 17-19). However, Period 20 (June 24) saw a significant drop to 73 units, likely exacerbated by the start of July summer vacation periods and the end of the traditional spring tailoring season. As the current date is July 1st, we are in the peak of the summer low season for structured blazers. Demand is expected to remain near this new low-regime floor, though slightly rebounding from the sharp drop of Period 20 towards the recently established summer average.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for the Mariette Blazer shows a clear seasonal pattern. Following a spring peak (~215 units) and a mid-season stabilization (~182 units), the product entered a summer trough in June. Recent demand (Periods 17-21) has averaged 114 units, with the most recent observation at 116 units. Period 20's dip to 73 units appears to be a deviation or an absolute seasonal floor, as Period 21 recovered to 116. Given the date (July 8), we are in the peak of summer, where demand for fitted blazers is typically at its annual low before the late-August 'back-to-work' transition. I expect demand to remain consistent with the established summer floor found in Periods 17-21, though slightly conservative until a clear upward trend for autumn begins.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailoring product (Mariette Blazer) has shown a clear decline as the season moves into summer. Following a mid-season average of ~180, demand dropped to a summer floor. The most recent 'Carry-over Insight' noted a floor averaging ~126 (Periods 17-19). However, Period 20 showed a significant dip to 73, followed by a partial recovery in Periods 21 and 22 (116 and 120 units respectively). These two most recent data points suggest the product is currently stabilized at a summer 'low' around 110-120 units. Given the date (July 15th), we are in the peak heat of summer, which typically suppresses demand for structured tailoring like blazers. The forecast expects demand to remain consistent with the immediate recent trend (avg of periods 21-22 is 118) as we wait for the late summer/early autumn transition.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal progression: a spring peak (avg ~215-230) followed by a gradual decline into the summer months. Currently, demand has stabilized in a summer trough. Over the last three periods (21, 22, 23), demand has been incredibly consistent, recording 116, 120, and 120 units respectively (Average: 118.7). Period 20 (73 units) appears to be an anomaly or a temporary dip. As of late July (Period 24), we are still firmly in the summer season for retail, where demand for heavy tailoring like blazers remains at its baseline floor before the late-August 'back-to-work' transition. I expect demand to remain stable at this current 115-120 unit level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows the 'Mariette Blazer' (a tailoring piece) experienced a significant downward shift in demand coinciding with the summer season. Carry-over insights previously identified a 'summer trough' averaging ~126 units (Periods 17-19). However, recent data shows a further degradation in this floor: demand in the last five periods (20-24) has dropped to an average of ~98 units, with significant volatility (highs of 120, lows of 63). Period 24 (July 22) hit a series low of 63. Given the date (July 29), we are at the peak of the summer clearance/low-demand period for structured tailoring before the autumn refresh typically begins in August. The forecast anticipates a slight mean reversion from the extremely low Period 24, while remaining within the established low-demand summer regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor established for late summer: Periods 20-24 show a further decline to an average of ~98 units (-22% from the previous summer trough of ~126).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a series of seasonal shifts for the Mariette Blazer. After a peak in early spring (avg ~215), demand declined through early summer, reaching a low-demand floor in late June/July. The most recent periods (20-25) have established a late-summer trough averaging 97.6 units, but with high volatility (swinging between 63 and 120). The current date is August 5, 2019. In retail tailoring, August often marks a transitional period between the summer clearance/low-demand phase and the 'Back to Office' or early Autumn fashion launch. However, there is no evidence yet in the data of a recovery. Recent observations (Periods 24-25) show 63 and 94 units, indicating the SKU is still likely in its summer trough. Given the recent average of ~98 and the most recent demand of 94, I expect demand to remain within this established floor for Period 26.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailoring SKU followed a predictable seasonal pattern: high demand during the spring launch (Period 1-8 avg ~225), followed by a gradual summer decline to a low trough in July (Periods 20-25 avg ~98). Period 26 (August 5) showed a significant jump to 146 units (+55% vs. previous period), marking the beginning of the 'Back to Business' seasonal transition. As we move further into mid-August, demand for blazers typically continues to rise as consumers prepare for the autumn season and return to professional environments. I expect demand to follow this upward trajectory, moving closer to the historical baseline of ~170 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailoring SKU followed a predictable seasonal cycle: a spring peak (Periods 1-9 avg ~215), a mid-season decline (Periods 15-24 avg ~115), and a late summer trough (Period 24 hit 63). However, a significant regime shift occurred starting in Period 26 (146 units) and intensified in Period 27 (301 units). These dates (early to mid-August) align perfectly with the 'Back-to-Business' or 'Early Autumn' retail season where dressing for work and formal layering becomes priority. Period 27's jump to 301 units (+106% from previous week; highest demand on record) confirms a powerful seasonal breakout. While Period 27 may be a local peak, the return of demand for tailoring suggests sustained high levels for the coming weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: Strong 'Back-to-Business' seasonal surge confirmed, with demand jumping from a summer avg of ~98 to 224 (Periods 26-27), a +128% increase, establishing a new high-demand autumn phase.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this tailoring SKU reflects strong seasonality. After a summer trough averaging ~98 units (Periods 20-25), a significant 'Back-to-Business' surge began in August. Period 26 (146), Period 27 (301), and Period 28 (251) show a sharp increase as customers return to work/school. The average for the last two weeks is 276. As of August 26 (Period 29), this peak is expected to sustain or slightly normalize before the next seasonal plateau. Given the volatility of the recent surge (301 to 251), I expect demand to remain high but potentially see a minor deceleration from the peak spike as the initial August rush stabilizes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data shows a significant 'Back-to-Business' demand regime shift starting in Period 26. After a low summer floor of ~98 units (Periods 20-25), demand surged as documented in Carry-over Period 28. In the most recent four weeks (Periods 26-29), demand levels were 146, 301, 251, and 231 respectively. Excluding the initial ramp-up week (146) and the peak outlier (301), the last two weeks (251 and 231) suggest a stabilization in the 230-250 range. As of Sept 2, we are in the peak period for autumn office-wear tailoring. Demand is expected to remain high but potentially see a slight natural cooling from the initial August restocking peak of 301. Given the recent average of ~241 over the last three weeks, a forecast of 235 is appropriate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for this SKU (Mariette Blazer) shows a strong 'Back-to-Business' seasonal surge beginning in August (Period 26). The carry-over insight from Period 28 noted a jump to an average of 224 units. Recent demand has accelerated further: Periods 27-30 show [301, 251, 231, 357], resulting in a trailing 4-period average of ~285 units. The most recent observation (Period 30: 357 units) represents the highest demand seen year-to-date, coinciding with the start of September when demand for professional tailoring typically peaks. Expecting demand to remain elevated but slightly stabilize following the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration in late-August/early-September: Period 27-30 demand averaged ~285 units, a +27% increase over the initial autumn surge avg (~224) and significantly above the training baseline.

Historical data shows a significant seasonal rebound starting in August, transitioning from a summer low (avg ~98) to an autumn 'Back-to-Business' peak. Demand has accelerated in September, with the last two periods (30 and 31) producing the highest volume of the year (357 and 328 respectively). Mid-September (Period 32) remains a peak calendar window for women's tailoring as professional and academic wardrobes are updated. Given the slight softening from the Period 30 peak but continued high baseline vs. July/August, I expect demand to remain strong in the 300-330 range.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant 'Back-to-Business' surge for this blazer SKU starting in August. Recent data indicates a secondary acceleration in September, with demand jumping from an average of ~261 (Periods 27-29) to ~342 (Periods 30-32). The current date (Sept 23) represents the peak of autumn tailoring demand. Given the stability across the last three weeks (357, 328, 341), I expect demand to remain at this elevated level for the current period before the eventual late-autumn tapering.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed for peak autumn season: Periods 30-32 show stabilization at a high-demand regime averaging ~342 units, a +20% increase over the initial autumn surge levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its autumn peak season for tailoring. Following a stabilized plateau of approximately 342 units (Periods 30-32), Period 33 experienced a sharp surge to 612 units (+79% week-over-week). This spike, occurring in late September, likely correlates with end-of-month 'payday' shopping patterns and the peak seasonal transition to heavier tailoring. For Period 34 (September 30), a regression from this extreme high is expected, though demand should remain significantly elevated compared to the early September plateau as October remains a core month for 'dressed' categories. I forecast a pull-back to the mid-400s, reflecting a balance between the recent spike and the established seasonal trend.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Mariette Blazer underwent a significant autumn surge starting in Period 26, reaching a stabilized high-demand plateau of ~342 units between Periods 30-32. Period 33 saw an extreme spike to 612 units, which appears to be a short-term outlier (likely a promotion or specific event) rather than a regime shift, as Period 34 immediately corrected back to 313 units. This correction brings the demand back in line with the established autumn plateau (310-360 range). For early October, tailoring demand remains seasonally relevant but often begins to stabilize or slightly soften following the peak 'Back-to-Business' window in September. Therefore, the forecast assumes demand will remain within the current plateau range, slightly adjusted for the downward movement seen in the most recent non-outlier observation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand throughout the autumn peak (Periods 30-35) has been significantly higher than previous months, driven by 'Back-to-Business' seasonality. Period 33 saw a massive outlier spike (612 units), which has since corrected back to a more sustainable level. Analyzing the most recent two periods (34 and 35), demand has averaged 298 units (313 and 283 respectively). This indicates a slight deceleration from the Period 30-32 plateau (~342 units) as the initial peak-autumn momentum begins to cool slightly in mid-October. Given the current date of October 14th, we anticipate demand to remain relatively stable but continue a gentle normalization downward from the September highs. I will forecast a value consistent with the post-spike average (approx. 290).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a strong seasonal trajectory: after a summer trough (~98 units), the SKU entered a 'Back-to-Business' phase (Aug/Sept) peaking at an average of ~342 units with a notable spike in Period 33 (612 units). Recent data (Periods 34-36) indicates a demand deceleration and stabilization at a lower plateau following that peak. Specifically, the last three periods (34, 35, 36) recorded 313, 283, and 282 units respectively, showing a clear descent from the September highs. For the current date (Oct 21), we are moving into late autumn. The demand appears to have settled into a new post-peak range. Given the stability between the last two weeks (283 vs 282), the forecast anticipates a continuation of this stable lower-plateau demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 34: Post-autumn peak deceleration confirmed, with demand stabilizing at a lower plateau averaging ~293 units (Periods 34-36) compared to the previous peak average of ~342 (-14%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM Demand Forecast:

LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant autumn 'Back-to-Business' surge peaking in Period 33 (612 units). Following this peak, demand has entered a sustained stabilization phase. Over the last four periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged approximately 298 units (313, 283, 282, 313), representing a stable plateau following the earlier seasonal acceleration. As of late October (Period 38), the blazer product category remains relevant for autumn tailoring and layering. Given the consistency of the recent four-week trend which shows a narrow range between 282 and 313, the forecast remains anchored to this established post-peak average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant 'Back-to-Business' autumn regime that peaked in late September (Period 33). Following a stabilization at a lower plateau (~293 units) in Periods 34-36, we are now observing a resurgence in demand. Period 37 (313) and Period 38 (385) indicate a clear upward movement. Given the date (Nov 4), we are entering the pre-holiday shopping period. In retail, November often sees increased demand for dressed categories like blazers due to early holiday events and seasonal promotions. Comparing the recent average (349 over the last two periods) with the \uc774\uc804 peak levels (~342), the product is exhibiting strong momentum. I anticipate a minor further increase as the trend builds toward mid-November peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration observed in late Oct/early Nov: Periods 37-38 show an average of 349 units, a +19% increase from the previous stabilization plateau of 293, indicating a secondary pre-holiday surge for tailoring.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a robust autumn season with a peak stabilization around 342 units and a secondary surge in late October (Periods 37-38 avg: 349). Period 39 experienced a sharp drop to 231 units, which significantly deviates from the established autumn trend. However, Period 40 coincides with November 11 (Singles' Day), a major retail event that typically drives high demand in dressing and tailoring categories as consumers transition into holiday party and gift-giving seasons. My forecast anticipates a rebound from the Period 39 dip, moving back toward the broader autumn/early winter baseline. Given the 11/11 event and the overall strength of this SKU in the latter half of the year, I expect demand to recover to previous plateau levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows the SKU entered a high-demand phase in late August, peaking in late September (Period 33). Following a stabilization at ~293 units (Periods 34-36), demand showed high volatility with a pre-holiday surge to 385 (Period 38) followed by a sharp correction to 231 (Period 39). The most recent period (40) shows a partial recovery to 278 units. Entering the third week of November (Period 41), seasonal demand for 'Dressed' tailoring like this blazer typically stays strong due to corporate holiday events and upcoming Black Friday/Cyber Week retail activity. However, the recent two-week average (255) is significantly lower than the preceding peak, suggesting a cooling of the secondary surge. I expect demand to track closer to the recent stabilization level of ~280-300 units as the market prepares for late November sales events, likely showing a slight momentum increase from Period 40.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a recent stabilization in demand following a late-October surge; Periods 39-41 averaged 251 units, representing a -28% decline from the previous peak average of 349 (Periods 37-38). However, Period 42 (starting 2019/11/25) includes Black Friday (Nov 29), which is a major retail event likely to drive a significant demand spike for this tailoring SKU. Given past surges (P33 reached 612 and P38 reached 385), demand is expected to rise sharply from the current base of 251. Applying a conservative seasonality multiplier for the Black Friday event, a forecast of 465 is projected to account for both the promo week and the transition into holiday party season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 39: Demand has decelerated from the early-Nov pre-holiday surge (avg 349) to a lower pre-Black Friday baseline averaging ~251 units (Periods 39-41).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical pattern analysis shows that Period 42 (2019/11/25) experienced a massive spike to 733 units, which coincides with the Black Friday retail event. Historically, demand for tailoring SKUs significantly retracts immediately following Black Friday/Cyber Monday as the promotional period ends and consumer spending temporarily dips before the final Christmas surge. Comparing this to the previous regime (Periods 39-41), the baseline before the anomaly was approximately 251 units. Given that the current date (2019/12/02) is the week following Black Friday, I expect demand to revert from the extreme outlier toward the recent baseline, while potentially remaining slightly elevated due to holiday shopping and seasonal party demand for a dressed blazer.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday surge confirmed: Period 42 demand jumped to 733 units (+192% vs the previous 3-period average of 251), identifying a critical annual promotional peak for this SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a significant surge in demand during Period 42 (733 units), which corresponds to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions. Period 43 shows a sharp correction down to 169 units, which falls below the pre-promotion baseline of ~251 units established in Periods 39-41. This 'post-promotion hangover' is typical as demand is pulled forward into the sale period. For Period 44 (starting Dec 9), historical patterns for mid-December generally see a stabilization as consumers transition from major sales events to final holiday gift shopping. Given the product is a dressed-up blazer, it maintains relevance for holiday events. I expect demand to recover slightly from the post-BF trough but remain below the pre-BF baseline (251) as the peak 'Back to Business' season has concluded and seasonal deceleration begins.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a significant increase in demand in Period 44 (304 units), recovering from the post-Black Friday dip (169 units). This recovery aligns with the pre-holiday shopping window for 'Womens Tailoring' as customers purchase blazers for festive events and end-of-year office wear. Period 45 (starting Dec 16) is the final full week before Christmas, typically characterized by sustained high demand for dressed categories. Given the previous stabilization plateau of ~293-349 units for this SKU during the autumn peak, and the most recent observation of 304 units, demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase as shoppers finalize holiday outfits. I anticipate demand will align closely with the recent mid-range peak observed in Period 44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data for Period 46 (Dec 23 - Dec 29) encapsulates the Christmas holiday and the start of the post-Christmas/Boxing Day sales period. After the Black Friday surge (P42: 733) and subsequent correction (P43: 169), demand recovered to a pre-holiday plateau (P44-P45 avg: 281). However, Period 46 covers the week of Christmas itself. Typically, for tailoring/dressed categories, demand for event-related wear peaks in the weeks prior (P44). The current period is likely to see a decrease in 'full-price' demand as the holiday party season concludes, though this may be partially offset by the start of year-end clearance sales on Dec 26th. Following the downward trend from P44 (304) to P45 (258), and anticipating the seasonal lull during the Christmas-to-New-Year transition, a forecast in the 170-190 range is most probable, aligning with late-spring baseline levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for this tailoring SKU shows significant seasonality. Following the Black Friday surge (P42: 733), demand stabilized in the low-to-mid 200s (P44: 304, P45: 258) before a sharp decline during Christmas week (P46: 128). The current period (P47: Dec 30 - Jan 5) typically sees a rebound from the holiday trough as consumers engage in post-Christmas clearance shopping and prepare for a 'Back-to-Work' transition in early January. While the previous week was very low due to the holiday lull, a recovery towards the late-autumn baseline of ~200-240 units is expected, though maybe not a full recovery until the second week of January.
