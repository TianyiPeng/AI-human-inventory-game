In retail, February is the start of the Spring/Summer season, and women's tailoring often sees stable to increasing demand as professionals update their wardrobes for the new season. Historical demand samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] show an average demand of approximately 173 units per period. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the 4 periods it takes for the order to arrive (P2, P3, P4, P5), totaling 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Total inventory needed = Average Demand (173) * (Lead Time + 1) = 173 * 5 = 865 units.

Current date is Feb 18, 2019, which is the start of the spring fashion season. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] average ~173. The Period 1 demand was 227 (significantly higher than the average, indicating a possible spring trend or initial launch spike). c) Lead Time/Pipeline: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The 900 units ordered in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (P1+4) and will be visible in P6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand due to P1 demand exceeding starting stock (0 units). d) Inventory Assessment: Total demand from P1 to P6 (when the next order could potentially arrive) must be covered. Assuming a conservative demand of ~200/period, total demand for 6 periods (P1 to P6) is ~1200 units. Pipeline has 900 units. e) Final Order Logic: We are currently stock-out. Since L=4, an order placed now in P2 will arrive in P6. We need to cover demand for P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 (5 periods). Using a forecast of 200 units/period + safety stock for the high P1 signal, we need ~1100 units to cover the lead-time window. With 900 in transit, ordering 200 additional units now is prudent to ensure stock continuity once the initial shipment starts being consumed.",

My objective is to cover demand for a lead time window of L+1 (4+1=5 periods). Given moving average demand (~255) and trending up, I estimate 5 periods of demand at ~1,350 units.

With L=4, the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover demand for Period 15 (current) plus the 4-period lead time window (P16, P17, P18, P19). Calculation: Required Coverage = 5 periods * 170 units/period = 850 units. Current Position: On-hand (403) + In-transit (200) = 603 units. Total Shortfall = 850 - 603 = 247 units. Given the holding cost is $1.0 vs profit $4.0 (a relatively high 25% ratio), and we have seen demand dips as low as 130 recently, I will order enough to bring the inventory position up to ~250 units over the next 5 periods, plus a small buffer.

  "rationale": "The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in a post-peak tapering phase as we head into late November (Period 42). Historical data and recent trends (P39-P41 avg ~251 units) confirm a decline from the October peak (~317 units). As we approach the end of the simulation (Period 47), the lead time of 4 periods becomes a critical constraint. Orders placed now (P42) will arrive in Period 46, leaving only one additional period of demand to cover. Total demand to cover from P42 to P47 (6 periods) is estimated at 1,500 units (6 * 250 avg). Current pipeline is: On-hand (316) + In-transit (750) = 1,066 units. Remaining demand after current inventory and transit is roughly 434 units. However, we must be careful not to over-order as the game ends at P47, and excess inventory will incur holding costs without being sold. Current in-transit details: P38 order (50 units) arrives P42, P39 order (450 units) arrives P43, P40 order (100 units) arrives P44, P41 order (150 units) arrives P45. The 450 units arriving in P43 are key to preventing stockouts during the tapering phase. Ordering 300 units now ensures coverage through P46 & P47 while accounting for potential demand spikes.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) experienced a massive unexpected demand spike in Period 42 (733 units), far exceeding the tapering trend observed in November (~255 units). This spike coincides with the start of the holiday/Black Friday shopping season (Late Nov/Early Dec). Demand is expected to remain high during this promotional period before potentially tapering as we approach mid-December. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit arrivals expected: Period 43: 450 units (Ordered P39), Period 44: 100 units (Ordered P40), Period 45: 150 units (Ordered P41), Period 46: 300 units (Ordered P42). Given the significant stockout in Period 42 (367 units lost), I need to aggressively cover the remaining periods (P43-P47). Total expected demand for P43-P47 (5 periods) at a holiday-adjusted rate of ~400 units/period equals 2000 units. Total pipeline (450+100+150+300) is 1000 units. To balance the risk of further stockouts during the holiday peak with the $1.0 holding cost, I will order 500 units to bolster the pipeline for the final periods (P46-P47).",

  "rationale": "The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is in the post-holiday December phase. World knowledge indicates that after the late November peak (733 units in Period 42), demand typically drops as the primary 'Black Friday' rush subsides, which is confirmed by Period 43's demand of 169 units. We are now heading into mid-December (Period 44); while some holiday gifting demand may persist, the peak for professional tailoring often dips further before rising again for the New Year/Career season in January. On-hand inventory is 281. The in-transit pipeline is significant at 1050 units, with 100 arriving next period (ordered P40), 150 the following (P41), 300 (P42), and 500 (P43). Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current date (Dec 9), orders placed now arrive in early January (Period 48). Since the game ends at Period 47, any order placed now will NOT arrive in time to be sold or contribute to profit, but would only incur costs if lead times were shorter. Therefore, I will halt ordering to optimize final ending inventory and profit for the remaining 4 periods.",

Demand forecast for the final three periods (P45-P47) based on late December norms and recent tapering (avg ~200-250) suggests total demand might reach 600-750.

From history, the demand regime for late December (post-holiday surge) has stabilized between 250-300 units (Period 44 demand was 304, Period 45 was 258).
