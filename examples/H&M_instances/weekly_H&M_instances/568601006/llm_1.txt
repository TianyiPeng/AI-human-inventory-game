Demand for professional wear typically picks up in early spring as people refresh work wardrobes. b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples are [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging ~173 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 will arrive in P3 (visible in P4). d) Inventory: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Order Logic: To avoid stockouts, I must cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3). Total coverage needed = 3 periods * 173 average = 519 units. Given the seasonality (spring workwear) and the risk of being at 0 inventory, I will order enough to cover this base demand plus a small buffer to account for the upper range of historical samples (max 196). Target stock = ~550 units.",

Analysis of the first three periods reveals a significant upward demand shift compared to the historical samples (avg ~173). In Periods 1-3, demand was 227, 284, and 198 (avg ~236), representing a ~36% increase over the prior samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the rules, an order placed in P1 arrives in P1+2=P3. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, meaning the P1 order (550 units) has not arrived yet. Since the order is overdue, I must evaluate if it's lost or just delayed. A 1-period delay is common, so I expect the P1 order to arrive in P4. Total pipeline is 1050 (P1: 550, P2: 250, P3: 250). Current inventory is 0. Expected demand for P4 and the lead-time window (P4-P6) at ~240 units/period is roughly 720 units.

This confirms a higher demand regime (+33%) compared to priors. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: The order from P1 (550 units) and P2 (250 units) are currently 'lost' or significantly delayed, as they have not arrived within the promised (2) or observed (1) lead times. However, the P3 order of 250 units arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). The pipeline is unstable. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 36.

Recent demand (P25: 94, P26: 146) suggests a slight uptick as the market transitions from summer into early autumn/back-to-office season.

With demand trending back up toward ~150-180 for the late August/September period, I need to secure inventory.

Analyzing the pipeline: 3500 units are 'in-transit', but most are confirmed lost.

To cover a 3-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=4) at a forecast of 300 units/period, I need a total of 1200 units.
