(b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples show [161, 145, 179, 196, 186], averaging approx. 173 units/period.

While the primary peak occurred in March/April, late Spring demand remains robust, likely due to office wear or event dressing.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer' (Women's Tailoring). Calendar context is Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the week of Christmas. Historically, demand spiked in late September (612) and significantly for Black Friday (733). Mid-December showed a secondary peak with Period 44 (304) and Period 45 (258). For Period 46 (Christmas week), demand for professional tailoring likely faces a sharp seasonal drop as retail transitions from party/gift shopping to post-holiday lulls. Previous late-December trends in similar retail contexts suggest a cooling period before New Year celebrations or January clearance. Inventory is low (22) and lead time is confirmed 0. I will target a stock level of 130 to cover potential residual holiday demand while avoiding excessive holding costs during the expected year-end slowdown. Calculation: Target (130) - On-hand (22) = 108.",
  "carry_over_insight": "December demand profile confirmed: saw a mid-month peak (P44-P45 avg: 281), but entering Christmas week (P46), a seasonal drop is anticipated based on tailoring category trends.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The current date is December 30th (Period 47). Looking at the historical demand for this 'Mariette Blazer', there's a clear seasonal pattern: demand dropped significantly during the Christmas week (P46: 128 units) compared to the mid-December peak (P44-P45 avg: 281). Historically, tailoring products see a further lull during the New Year transition followed by a potential 'Back-to-Work' uptick in January. As Period 47 is the turn of the year, I expect demand to remain low or slightly recover from the holiday dip. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 2 units. I will forecast demand for Period 47 to be slightly higher than the Christmas week dip but lower than the December average, targeting approximately 150 units to satisfy demand while minimizing holding costs at the end of the year.",
