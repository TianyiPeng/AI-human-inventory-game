In mid-February (2019/2/11), demand for smart-casual/professional wear often increases as consumers prepare for spring workwear or early seasonal transitions. Historical demand samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] show an average of approximately 173 units per period. Theoretical Lead Time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in P5 conclude). I must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Total projected demand for 5 periods is ~865 units (173 * 5). Since I start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, I will place a substantial initial order to build the pipeline and mitigate the 4-period arrival delay. I will target slightly above the average to account for potential spring seasonality and prevent stockouts during the lengthy lead time.",

Historical mean was ~173/period, but actual demand in P1 (227) and P2 (284) shows a significant upward trend, likely due to the spring professional/occasion-wear season starting in mid-to-late February.

Since P3 is the period of the third decision, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 (L=4: P1+4=P5), becoming on-hand for P6. Thus, I need to cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 before the first shipment arrives. Total demand observed so far (P1: 227 + P2: 284 = 511) has all been 'lost' because on-hand was 0.

Historically, demand peaked in February-March (approx. 220-230 units) and has since softened as we move into May. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 157 units, indicating a stabilized lower regime for the late spring season. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. For Period 14, my on-hand inventory is 564 units. The pipeline (in-transit) consists of 260 units: 140 (ordered P10, due P14 arrival/P15 start) and 120 (ordered P11, due P15 arrival/P16 start). Total inventory position is 824 units. To cover 5 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of 160 units/period, I need approximately 800 units. My current pipeline (824 units) is sufficient to cover demand through Period 18. Adding more now would likely incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit) given the softening demand and the current stock level. Therefore, no order is placed this period.",

This reflects a major seasonal transition as August progresses. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the unexpected magnitude of the demand spike in Period 27 (301 vs. expected ~150). Total in-transit is 430 units.

The current period (P28) order will arrive in P32. Assuming demand persists at this new 'High' level (~250-300 per period) due to the seasonal fall peak for blazers, the pipeline needs significant reinforcement. Expected demand over 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 1,250 units (5 * 250). Current pipeline (430) is insufficient to cover this transition.

We currently have 1284 units on-hand and 1000 units in-transit (400 from P36, 400 from P38, 200 from P39). The expected arrival schedule is: P40 (arriving now, visible P41) = 400 units, P41 = 0 (no P37 order), P42 = 200 units, P43 = 400 units. Total inventory available to cover the remaining periods is 1284 (on-hand) + 1000 (in-transit) = 2284 units. Over the remaining 8 periods, if demand remains at approximately 250-300 units, we need 2000-2400 units. Currently, we have 2284. To avoid stockouts in the final weeks (P44-P47) while accounting for potential late-season demand or slight variance, a small buffer order is prudent, but we must be careful not to over-order and incur high holding costs on the 1284 units already on-hand ($1/unit per period). Forecasted demand for the remaining horizon is ~2000 units. Total supply is 2284. I will place a moderate order of 200 to ensure late-game availability without drastically increasing holding cost exposure.",

The remaining demand periods are P44, P45, P46, and P47.

Total remaining demand over the next two periods is approximately 500-600 units. PIPELINE: There are 200 units in-transit (ordered P43, due to arrive in Period 47).

Current inventory status is: On-hand = 369 units, In-transit = 200 units (representing the order from Period 43). At the end of Period 47, demand will be resolved from the 369 units on hand. Historically, late December demand (P45=258, P46=128) shows a downward trend. Even with a baseline demand of ~150-250 units for the final period, the ending inventory will be positive, incurring holding costs, but no new orders can reach customers before the simulation ends.
