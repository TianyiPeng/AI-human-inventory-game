In the retail calendar, mid-February is the transition into Spring/Pre-Spring collections. Blazers are versatile transitional pieces. b) Demand Regime: Historical samples [161, 145, 179, 196, 186] show a mean of ~173.4 units per period. February usually sees steady demand as customers refresh workwear. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 arrive in P3 resolution and are visible in P4 decision phase. d) Inventory: Currently 0 on-hand, 0 in-transit. To cover demand for periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1), I need to cover approximately 174 * 3 = 522 units. e) Final Order Logic: Since on-hand is 0, I must order enough to establish a pipeline.

  "rationale": "a) World Knowledge & Product Description: The product is a 'Mariette Blazer', a women's tailoring item. February/March coincides with the 'Spring/Summer' fashion transition, where demand for blazers typically increases for professional and seasonal wear. b) Demand Regime: Initial historical samples (avg ~173) suggested lower demand, but realized demand in P1-P3 (227, 284, 198) averages ~236. There is a clear upward shift compared to the seed data, likely due to seasonality. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. For the P1 order (520 units), the arrival resolution happens during P3, and visibility occurs in P4's 'conclude' message. However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0. Per the rules, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and is visible at the start of P4. I am currently at the start of P4, reading the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which confirms 0 units arrived. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0 due to stockouts. In-transit is 900 (520 from P1, 170 from P2, 210 from P3). e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Assuming L=3 now, I need to cover P4, P5, P6, and P7.

As the date is November 11th, demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease as the transition to the holiday season begins, though blazers are often staple items for office/holiday parties. On-hand inventory is currently 671 units. Total In-transit is 3368, but a significant portion (2468 units) consists of confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1, P2, P6, P10, P11, P17, P23, P24, P27). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline contains the P35 (400 units) and P39 (300 units) orders. Lead times recently have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. With 671 on-hand, I am covered for ~2.2 periods of average demand (301 units/period). P35 is 5 periods old and likely lost or severely delayed. To maintain a safe service level for the next 3 periods (target 900-1000 units), I will order 300 units to bolster the pipeline against the persistent ~50% shipment loss rate.",
  "carry_over_insight": "P35 (400 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting the systemic shipment loss rate remains high (~50%). Effective pipeline calculation must continue to exclude orders older than 4 periods.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 568601006 (Mariette Blazer) is currently in a stable autumn demand regime. Over the last four periods (P37-P40), demand has averaged 301.75 units per period. Historically, demand for this 'Dressed/Tailoring' category often spikes around late November and December due to holiday festivities and professional events. In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 393 units. The pipeline analysis shows 3668 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights, orders older than 4-5 periods are considered lost. Specifically, P35 (400 units) is likely lost. The reliable pipeline consists of the P39 order (300 units, placed 1 period ago) and the P40 order (300 units, placed 0 periods ago). With a promised lead time of 2 periods and an actual lead time that varies between 1-3 periods, I need to ensure coverage for approximately 3 periods of demand (current + L+1). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~900 units. Current inventory (393) + reliable in-transit (600) = 993 units. This provides sufficient coverage for the next few periods while keeping holding costs manageable, especially given the high risk of shipment loss and the approaching end of the game (Period 47). I will place a moderate order to maintain this buffer as we enter the holiday season.",

Black Friday/Cyber Monday typically falls in late November (Period 42/43 context), which often triggers a demand spike in the 'Dressed' apparel category, though blazers are less sensitive to this than gift items. Inventory on-hand is 448. The pipeline is heavily inflated by 3618 units, of which 2468 were confirmed lost in earlier insights. Recent orders (P39, P40, P41) are the only reliable parts of the pipeline. P39 arrived in 2 periods. P40 (ordered P40) is due now (P42, LT=2). P41 (ordered P41) is due in P43.

Systemic shipment loss remains the critical operational risk; historically ~50% of orders are lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is currently 0.

The active pipeline consists of P43 (900 units) and P44 (800 units). Given a lead time of 1-2 periods, the P43 order is expected to arrive during P45 (visible P46) and P44 during P46 (visible P47). Expected demand for the final 3 periods is estimated at ~350 units/period (total 1,050). Current On-hand is 0.
