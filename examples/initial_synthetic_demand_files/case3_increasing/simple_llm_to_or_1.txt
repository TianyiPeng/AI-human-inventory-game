Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The past demand values are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean of this series is 111.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 17, indicating moderate volatility. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: This is Period 1 of a 50-period cycle. Without specific calendar dates (e.g., holidays) or seasonal descriptors beyond the general 'chips' category, I will rely on the mean and variance of the recent history. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: The data shows no clear linear trend; demand fluctuated from a peak of 138 down to the most recent value of 94. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the drop in the most recent period to 94, but a historical average of 111, I will forecast a value near the moving average to account for potential mean reversion while acknowledging the recent volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 111.4 with a standard deviation of 17.6, indicating moderate fluctuation across five periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The first observed period of the test phase (Period 1) recorded 91 units, which is slightly below the historical average but within the previously observed range (94-138). There are no specific calendar events or seasonal drivers identified for Period 2. Given the recent data point of 91 and the historical baseline, the forecast targets the lower end of the historical mean to account for the recent dip while expecting a slight regression toward the average of approximately 105-110.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data for chips(Regular) showed a stable demand mean of approximately 111.4 units (stdev ~17). However, the observed demand in the current test phase shows a significant shift: Period 1 was slightly lower at 91, but Period 2 saw a dramatic spike to 246 units. This suggests either a massive promotional event, a seasonal peak, or a fundamental regime shift. Given that chips are often subject to promotional spikes or event-based demand (like sports events or holidays), and the training data lacked such high variance, I must decide if Period 2 was an outlier or the start of a trend. Without specific calendar markers, I will weigh the recent average of the test periods (168.5) against the historical mean, while acknowledging the high volatility introduced in Period 2. I expect a partial mean reversion from the spike while remaining above the historical baseline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) initially averaged around 111 units. In the recent test phase, Period 1 started at 91 units, but Periods 2 and 3 showed a dramatic spike to 246 and 285 units respectively. This indicates a significant regime shift, likely due to a promotional event, seasonal peak, or a sudden change in consumer behavior. The demand increased by over 150% from the baseline. Given the upward trajectory from Period 2 to Period 3 (246 to 285), I expect the high-demand state to persist for Period 4, though the rate of increase may stabilize as it reaches a new peak plateau.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: avg demand increased from ~110 to ~265 (+140%) across 2 consecutive periods.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data (averaging 111.4) has been superseded by a significant upward shift starting in Period 2. The demand has grown consistently over the last three periods (246, 285, 437), showing both a regime shift and an accelerating trend. The most recent jump to 437 units indicates a potential seasonal peak or a strong upward momentum. Given the growth rate between P3 and P4 (~53%), but considering potential volatility, a forecast reflecting continued high-level demand with a slight moderate adjustment for the sharp recent spike is warranted.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward trend confirmed: Demand increased from an average of ~110 (Training/P1) to a current average of 322 over P2-P4, with P4 reaching 437 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $556.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data (avg ~111) is no longer relevant as the product has entered a high-growth phase starting Period 2. Analyzing the test phase: demand rose from 246 (P2) to 285 (P3), then jumped significantly to 437 (P4) and stabilized at 448 (P5). The average of the last two periods is ~442. While there is a strong upward trend, the growth slowed significantly between P4 and P5 (+2.5%), suggesting the demand may be reaching a new plateau or a slower growth stage. I will forecast a slight increase to 460, accounting for the persistent upward momentum while remaining cautious of potential stabilization.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau reached: Average demand surged from ~111 to ~442 (+298%) between P1 and P5, with the last two periods (P4-P5) stabilizing above 430 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is exhibiting a clear 'stair-step' growth pattern: a significant jump followed by a period of consolidation. Training and P1 averaged ~110. P2 and P3 stabilized around an average of 265. P4 and P5 stabilized around an average of 442. P6 has just seen another major jump to 587 (+139 units from P5). Historically, the period immediately following a large jump (P3, P5) shows a smaller increase or stabilization (P3 was +39, P5 was +11). Therefore, I predict P7 will be a consolidation period with a slight upward movement from the P6 level.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend revised: Pattern of 'jump and consolidate' confirmed. Major surges occur every 2 periods (P2, P4, P6) with an average jump of ~148 units, followed by smaller adjustments (+11 to +39 units). Current demand level has moved from the ~440 bracket to the ~600 bracket.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1020.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear 'jump and consolidate' pattern occurring every two periods. Significant surges were observed in P2 (+155), P4 (+152), and P6 (+139), followed by smaller consolidation increases in P3 (+39), P5 (+11), and P7 (+50). On average, the consolidation periods (odd-numbered periods) show a growth of approximately 33 units over the previous surge period. Given that Period 7 was a consolidation period following the Period 6 surge, and the historical pattern suggests the next major jump occurs on even-numbered periods (P2, P4, P6, and now P8), I anticipate a significant upward movement. The average jump over the last three cycles is ~148 units. Adding this to the P7 base of 637 suggests a target around 785. However, the growth rate of the jumps is slightly decelerating in absolute terms (155 -> 152 -> 139). I will forecast a surge of approximately 140 units over P7.

Carry-over insight: Two-period stair-step pattern confirmed: Even periods (2, 4, 6) trigger major demand surges (avg +148 units), while odd periods (3, 5, 7) represent consolidation phases (avg +33 units). Demand has scaled from ~100 to ~640 over 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1688.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical data for 'chips(Regular)' exhibits a consistent 'stair-step' growth pattern. Analysis of the test data (Periods 1-8) confirms that even-numbered periods generally experience large demand surges (P2: +155, P4: +152, P6: +139, P8: +139; Average surge: +146.25). Conversely, odd-numbered periods represent consolidation phases with smaller, yet positive, growth (P3: +39, P5: +11, P7: +50; Average growth: +33.3). Period 8 just saw a major surge of 139 units to reach a demand of 776. Following the established pattern, Period 9 is an 'odd' consolidation period. Applying the average consolidation growth of approximately +33 to +50 units to the Period 8 demand suggests a forecast in the low-to-mid 800s.

Carry-over insight: Stair-step pattern extended: Even-period surges now average +146 units (updated from +148) and odd-period consolidation phases average +33.3 units. The demand floor has moved from ~100 to nearly 800 units over 8 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent stair-step growth pattern. Looking at previous periods: P2 (+155), P4 (+152), P6 (+139), P8 (+139). These even-numbered periods consistently show large surges averaging +146 units. Odd-numbered periods (P3, P5, P7) typically show smaller consolidation increases (avg +33). However, P9 broke the consolidation trend with a massive jump of +187 units (from 776 to 963), suggesting an acceleration in the growth trend or a regime shift. Since P10 is an 'even' period which historically triggers a major surge, and P9 already exhibited extreme momentum, I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory. Applying a surge factor similar to previous even periods (~140-150 units) on top of the already high P9 base suggests a forecast in the 1100 range.

Carry-over insight: Trend acceleration at Period 9: Average 'consolidation' growth of +33 units was replaced by a surge of +187 units (+24%), signaling a potential break from the previous stair-step stability into a more aggressive growth phase.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a distinct stair-step or 'jump and consolidate' growth pattern. Even periods typically saw large surges (Avg +145), while odd periods involve smaller adjustments. However, Period 9 saw an unusually high surge (+187), and Period 10 experienced a significant contraction (-100). Comparing Period 10 (863) to Period 8 (776), the net growth over the two-period cycle is +87 units, which is a deceleration from previous cycles. Given that Period 11 is an odd period, it typically follows the consolidation phase where demand stabilizes or experiences modest growth after a shift. Since Period 10 was a corrective drop, Period 11 is expected to see a slight recovery or consolidation near the current level, likely between the P9 peak and the P10 floor.

Carry-over insight: Growth pattern volatility increased at Period 10: The previously observed 'surge' in even periods flipped to a sharp contraction of 100 units (-10.4%) following an outsized surge in Period 9, signaling a breakdown of the consistent 2-period stair-step rhythm.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a breakdown of the previously observed 2-period stair-step pattern. Starting from Period 9, the volatility has increased significantly: Period 9 saw a massive jump (+187), Period 10 a sharp contraction (-100), and Period 11 a massive rebound (+273). The overall trajectory remains strongly upward, scaling from ~100 to over 1100 units in 11 periods. Analyzing the last three periods (P9-P11), the average demand is 987.3. Given the aggressive and erratic growth seen in Period 11 (reaching 1136), and noting that previous large spikes (P2, P4, P6, P8) were followed by smaller upward adjustments during 'consolidation' phases (until P10 broke that rule), a slight stabilization or moderate increase is expected. The average growth per period over the last five periods is approximately 137 units. Period 12, being an even period, historically favored surges, but the recent P10 drop suggests the rhythm is inverted or more chaotic. I will forecast a moderate increase to reflect the strong momentum while accounting for the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surge: Since Period 9, the standard stair-step pattern has transitioned into high-variance swings (jumps of +187 and +273, with a -100 drop), while maintaining an aggressive upward trajectory with a new demand floor above 850 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. While the previously observed 'stair-step' pattern (even-period surge, odd-period consolidation) has become more volatile, the underlying growth remains strong. Over the last four periods (P9-P12), the demand has moved from 963 to 1221, averaging a growth of approximately 86 units per period despite a dip in P10. Specifically, P11 saw a massive surge of +273 units, followed by a more moderate but still significant growth of +85 units in P12. This suggests we are in a phase of higher-magnitude shifts. Given the last two periods' momentum (1136 and 1221), and the historical tendency for growth to accelerate in clusters, I anticipate a continued increase. The recent average increase (P9-P12) is ~64 units/period, but excluding the P10 outlier, the growth is substantially higher. Moving into P13, I project a continuation of the upward trend, targeting a level consistent with recent growth velocity.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth phase: Demand has increased from ~800 to over 1200 units within 5 periods (P8-P12), establishing a new demand floor above 1100 units and invalidating the previous strict stair-step rhythm in favor of high-magnitude upward volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an aggressive upward trajectory over the last 13 periods. Analysis of recent data shows that after the breakdown of the 2-period stair-step rhythm around Period 9, the product entered a high-growth phase. The most recent three periods (P11-P13) show demand stabilizing at a new high level (1136, 1221, 1246), suggesting a new plateau or a slower consolidation phase following the massive surge in P11. The growth from P12 (1221) to P13 (1246) was +25 units (+2%). Given the historical tendency for 'consolidation' periods to see modest gains before the next potential surge or high variance swing, I expect a continuation of this minor upward move, maintaining the support level above 1200 units.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed: Period 11-13 average demand is 1201 units, representing a 54% increase over the Period 8-10 average of 867 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant upward trajectory for chips(Regular), transitioning from an initial average of ~110 (P1) to a current plateau. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) show a stabilization and consolidation phase with demands of 1221, 1246, and 1265. This indicates a slowing of the aggressive growth seen between P8-P11, moving into a steady incremental growth pattern. The average gain over the last two periods is ~22 units per period (approx +1.8%). Given the 'jump and consolidate' history of this SKU, P15 is likely to maintain this consolidation trend with a small incremental increase before any potential future surge. I will forecast a slight continuation of the current momentum.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation phase confirmed at Period 12-14: Demand growth has slowed to an average of +22 units per period following the surge to the 1200+ level, establishing a stable high-volume demand floor.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new phase of high-magnitude growth. Historically, the product followed a 'stair-step' pattern (surges followed by consolidation), but recent data shows a breakdown of that rhythm in favor of more aggressive jumps. Specifically, Period 15 saw a major breakout to 1507 units (+242 units or +19%), moving past the established 1200-1265 consolidation range. Analysis of previous breakouts (P8 to P9, P10 to P11) shows that single-period surges are often followed by either a consolidation or a slight adjustment. Given that P15 was a significant leap, P16 is likely to settle into a new, slightly higher consolidation tier. I will project a modest increase reflecting the continued upward momentum but accounting for the post-surge stablization observed in previous cycles.

Carry-over insight: Breakout confirmed at Period 15: Demand jumped from a 3-period plateau of ~1244 units to 1507 units (+21%), establishing a new performance ceiling above 1500.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) demonstrates a consistent 'stair-step' growth pattern: a large surge followed by a consolidation phase. Most recently, Period 15 saw a significant breakout from the ~1240 level to 1507 units (+21%). Period 16 followed with a modest increase to 1547 units (+2.6%), which aligns perfectly with historical consolidation phases seen in Periods 3, 5, 7, 13, and 14 (where the second period after a jump typically shows growth between 1-8%). Given that Period 16 just completed the first step of a consolidation phase, I expect a slightly larger adjustment or continued upward momentum before the next major jump, following the pattern of the P12-P14 plateau. I am forecasting a continuation of this stable growth within the current 1500+ regime.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation at the 1500+ level confirmed: Following the Period 15 breakout, Periods 15 and 16 have averaged 1527 units, establishing a new high-volume baseline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a 'step and climb' pattern characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by consolidation or continued acceleration. Historical analysis shows a transition from a ~100 baseline to a current level above 1700. In the most recent sequence (P15-P17), demand jumped from a ~1250 plateau to 1507, 1547, and now 1724. This represents a significant acceleration in the last period (+11.4% from P16 to P17). Given the historical tendency for major surges (Period 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17) often to be followed by a secondary, more moderate increase or a short consolidation phase, I expect Period 18 to continue the upward momentum but at a slightly tempered rate compared to the P17 spike, targeting a move toward the 1800 level.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase confirmed: Demand increased from an average of ~1527 (P15-P16) to 1724 in P17 (+13%), marking the third distinct volume level breach in the last 7 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Historically, the product has followed a pattern of significant breakouts followed by short consolidation phases. Recent data shows a persistent growth phase: P15 (1507), P16 (1547), P17 (1724), and P18 (1802). The average growth over the last three periods (P16 to P18) is approximately +85 units per period (+1547 to +1724 is +177; +1724 to +1802 is +78). Period 18's increase of 78 units suggests a slight cooling from the P17 jump but remains firmly in a growth trend. Given the pattern of reaching a new level and then adding a incremental gain, I project a continuation of this trend. I will estimate the next period by applying a similar growth increment to the P18 value, targeting the next natural step in the 1800-1900 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth regime (Periods 15-18): Average demand has risen from ~1500 to ~1800 units, maintaining a 4-period growth streak with a total increase of 295 units (+20%) since the Period 15 breakout.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained and accelerating upward trend. Historically, the product has followed a 'stair-step' or 'jump and consolidate' pattern, but recent periods show an aggressive growth phase. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has grown from 1507 to 2075, a 37% increase. Specifically, Period 19 saw a significant surge of +273 units (+15%) from Period 18. Given the carry-over insights indicating that large surges (like P19) are often followed by a consolidation phase or a slightly smaller growth step (averaging +22 to +40 in previous consolidation phases), I expect Period 20 to maintain the new high level with a modest additional increase rather than another massive leap, projecting a continuation of the upward trajectory at a slightly moderated pace.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive growth phase confirmed (P15-P19): Demand has moved from the 1500-level to exceeding the 2000-unit threshold within 5 periods, with an average period-over-period growth of approximately 142 units (+8.5%) during this stretch.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow an aggressive long-term upward trajectory characterized by large 'jumps' followed by brief consolidations or minor corrections. Recently, demand surged to a peak of 2075 in Period 19 (+273) before experiencing a correction to 1973 in Period 20 (-102). This behavior mirrors the Period 9-10 sequence, where a peak (963) was followed by a similar 100-unit contraction (863). Historically, these contractions are temporary and precede a recovery back to the growth trend. After the Period 10 correction, demand jumped significantly (+273). Given the current momentum and the 'stair-step' growth pattern, I expect Period 21 to recover from the Period 20 dip and target a new consolidation level slightly above the previous peak of 2075, likely settling around the 2150-2200 range.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand contraction at Period 20 (-102 units) mirrors the Period 10 contraction (-100 units), both occurring after reaching significantly higher volume thresholds. Historical recovery from such corrections suggests a return to the long-term growth trend in the subsequent period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward 'stair-step' growth pattern, where major surges are followed by brief consolidation or correction phases. Period 20 saw a contraction of 102 units (1973), mirroring the correction seen in Period 10 (-100 units). Period 21 showed signs of stabilization at 1983 (+10 units). Historically, after a correction/stabilization phase (like Periods 10-11 or 13-14), the demand typically enters a new jump phase that establishes a higher floor. Since the growth from P15 to P19 averaged roughly 142 units per period and the previous peak was 2075, I anticipate a move that recovers the loss from the P20 correction and pushes the demand toward a new record level, consistent with the long-term trend.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow an aggressive long-term upward trend characterized by periodic breakouts followed by short consolidation phases. Recently, after a minor correction at Period 20 (1973) and a flat Period 21 (1983), demand broke out again in Period 22 to 2221 units (+12% growth). This mirrors previous patterns where a pause in growth precedes a significant jump to a new volume level. Historical data shows that jumps often occur in pairs or are followed by a period of stabilization/slight growth. Specifically, looking at past behavior (e.g., P15-P16, P17-P18), a jump to a new level is typically followed by a stabilization at or slightly above that new level. Considering the average increase of ~238 units in the most recent significant jump (P21 to P22), I expect Period 23 to consolidate this gain with a modest increase to maintain the upward momentum without immediate cooling.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor established above 2200 units at Period 22. Average demand for the last five periods (P18-P22) is 2011 units, a 28% increase over the previous five-period average (P13-P17) of 1572 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward stair-step trajectory. Historically, large two-period surges (like P8-P9 at +326 units and P18-P19 at +351 units) are followed by a correction or demand contraction (P10 at -100 units and P20 at -102 units). Period 22 and 23 have just completed a similar two-period surge totaling +343 units (2221 and 2326 respectively). Based on the established patterns at Period 10 and Period 20, a technical correction or 'cooling off' period is expected for Period 24. I am forecasting a modest contraction of approximately 4-5%, similar to previous pullbacks, settling demand around the 2220-2250 range.

Carry-over insight: Two-period surge pattern confirmed at P22-P23: Significant growth clusters (totalling ~340 units) consistently precede a short-term contraction or stabilization period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a strong upward trajectory, reaching a new peak of 2566 in Period 24. Analysis of historical growth cycles (P9-P10 and P19-P21) shows that significant surges of +200-500 units over 2-3 periods are often followed by a short-term contraction or stabilization phase of approximately -100 to +10 units. Specifically, the growth from Period 21 (1983) to Period 24 (2566) represents a cumulative increase of 583 units (+29%) over just three periods. Given the 'two-period surge' pattern noted in previous insights and the magnitude of the recent jump to the 2500+ level, a technical correction or consolidation is expected. I am forecasting a slight contraction similar to the Period 10 and Period 20 corrections, targeting a stabilization around the mid-2400s.

Carry-over insight: Extended growth cycle confirmed at P22-P24: Demand surged by 583 units (+29%) over three periods, surpassing the previous 'two-period' surge rhythm and establishing a new demand ceiling above 2500 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a 'jump and consolidate' pattern. Following a significant three-period growth cycle (P22-P24) that added 583 units (+29%), Period 25 (2604 units) showed an immediate slowdown with only +38 units of growth. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that these major surges are typically followed by 2-3 periods of stabilization or consolidation. Previous consolidation phases showed average gains of approximately 33 units (as noted in Period 9 and 15 insights). Given that P25 was the first period of the current stabilization phase, Period 26 is expected to remain near the 2600-unit level with a minor adjustment, following the established stair-step rhythm.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation phase initiated at Period 25: Following a 583-unit surge over three periods, demand growth slowed to +38 units, mirroring previous stair-step stabilization patterns.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of chips(Regular) shows a consistent 'surge and consolidate' pattern. Currently, the product is in a consolidation phase following a significant 3-period surge (P22-P24) that added 583 units. Following previous outsized surges (e.g., P11-P14 and P18-P21), demand typically stabilizes for 2-3 periods with growth ranging between +20 and +50 units per period. Periods 25 and 26 have shown very stable growth of +38 and +41 units respectively. Period 27 is expected to be the final period of this consolidation phase before the next potential breakout, continuing the current trajectory of approximately +40 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a strong stair-step growth pattern. Analyzing the most recent data (P24-P27): demand surged in P24 (+240), consolidated in P25 and P26 (averaging +40 growth), and then surged again in P27 (+245, a +9% increase). This pattern mirrors previous cycles where a significant breakout is followed by a period of stabilization or 'consolidation' at the new higher plateau. Historically, periods following a ~250 unit surge (like P9 to P10 or P24 to P25) show either a contraction or significantly slower growth. P27 represents a major breakout beyond the 2600-level. Given the 'jump and consolidate' rhythm confirmed in Carry-over Insights (Period 7, 8, and 26), I expect Period 28 to be a consolidation phase with minimal growth or a slight correction relative to the P27 peak.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation pattern confirmed at Period 25-27: Breakout surges exceeding 240 units (P24, P27) are consistently followed by stabilization periods where growth slows to <2% or contracts slightly (~ -5%).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a persistent 'stair-step' growth pattern characterized by significant breakout surges followed by consolidation or slight corrections. Period 27 saw a major breakout to 2890 units (+245), followed by a sharp correction in Period 28 to 2643 units (-247). This contraction mirrors the behavior seen in Period 20 and Period 10, where hitting a new volume threshold triggered a temporary pullback of ~100-250 units before returning to the growth trend or establishing a new plateau. Specifically, following a correction, demand typically recovers to the level of the previous stabilization or slightly above the correction floor. Given that Period 28 landed exactly at the level of Period 26 (2645), and the long-term trend remains aggressively upward, I anticipate Period 29 will represent a stabilization or slight recovery phase within the current high-volume (2600-2800) range.

Carry-over insight: Recurring 'breakout-correction' cycle confirmed: Three historical instances (P10, P20, P28) show that surges exceeding ~240 units are followed by corrections of 100-250 units, which then establish a new demand floor for the next growth phase.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a long-term upward trend characterized by a 'breakout-correction' cycle. Period 27 established a peak at 2890 units, followed by a significant correction in Period 28 (-247 units) to 2643. Period 29 showed a strong recovery of +171 units (2814 total), which historically signals the start of a move toward a new demand ceiling. In previous cycles (e.g., after the Period 10 and Period 20 corrections), the two periods following a dip typically show sustained growth as a new floor is established. Given the recovery in Period 29, I expect Period 30 to continue this upward momentum, likely testing or slightly exceeding the previous high of 2890.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a continuation of the 'breakout-correction' cycle identified in previous periods. Specifically, Period 27 saw a massive surge to 2890 (+245), which was followed by a correction in Period 28 to 2643 (-247). We are currently in the recovery/consolidation phase of this cycle. Periods 29 (2814) and 30 (2873) show a steady upward movement, averaging a gain of ~115 units from the Period 28 low point. This growth of +59 units most recently suggests the market is stabilizing around the 2800-2900 range before the next potential breakout. Following the logic of the 'consolidation' phases seen after major corrections (e.g., P20-P21 or P10-P11), I expect a moderate increase as demand approaches the previous peak of 2890.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'breakout-correction' upward cycle. Following the major correction at Period 28 (2643 units), demand has entered a new growth phase: Period 29 (+171), Period 30 (+59), and Period 31 (+173). Total growth since the Period 28 floor is 403 units over 3 periods, averaging approximately 134 units per period. This growth rate aligns with historical post-correction phases (e.g., P10-P19 averaged ~134 units growth; P20-P27 averaged ~131 units growth). Given that Period 31 (3046) represents a significant breakout above the 3000-unit threshold, Period 32 is likely to see a stabilization or moderate continuation of this growth before the next major correction. Based on the current momentum (+173 in the last period), a forecast continuing the recent growth average is most likely.

Carry-over insight: Sustained post-correction growth phase (P28-P31): Demand has increased from 2643 to 3046 units (+403 units), maintaining a growth rate of ~134 units per period that mirrors the long-term expansion observed in previous cycles.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a well-documented 'breakout-correction' cycle. Historically, large surges are followed by brief consolidation or slight contraction phases. In the most recent sequence (P29-P32), demand grew for three consecutive periods from 2814 to 3046 (+232 units) before experiencing a minor contraction in P32 to 3005 (-41 units). Previous instances of such contractions (e.g., P10, P20, P28) typically resolved into a new growth leg within 1-2 periods. Given the current trend of approximately 134 units of growth per period during expansion phases (noted in P32 carry-over), and the fact that the P32 'dip' was relatively small, I expect demand to resume its upward trajectory. I am forecasting a return to growth, targeting the next level above the P31 high.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a recurring 'breakout-correction' or 'stair-step' cycle. Historical analysis shows that large surges in demand are typically followed by short-term consolidation or slight contraction. Recently, Period 31 reached a high of 3046, followed by a slight dip in Period 32 to 3005 (-41 units). Period 33 significantly broke out with a gain of +386 units (reaching 3391). In previous cycles (P9-10, P19-20, P27-28), surges of this magnitude (>200 units) led to immediate corrections ranging from -41 to -247 units. Period 32 already showed a minor consolidation, but the massive surge in Period 33 suggests the next period (P34) is highly likely to experience a technical correction of approximately 100-200 units as the market stabilizes at this new volume level. I anticipate a correction to roughly 3250 units.

Carry-over insight: New demand ceiling established at Period 33 (3391 units). The breakout-correction cycle continues, where surges exceeding +350 units (P33) are historically followed by stabilization or minor contractions (~3-6%) in the subsequent period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of the 'breakout-correction' cycle for SKU chips(Regular) reveals that significant surges (like the +386 unit jump in Period 33) are consistently followed by a 1-2 period stabilization or minor contraction. Period 34 showed a very mild contraction of -23 units (-0.7%), which is less severe than historical corrections following such large peaks (typically 3-6%). Since the demand floor has consistently moved upward after these brief pauses (e.g., P10 to P11, P20 to P22, P28 to P29), Period 35 is expected to resume the long-term growth trend. Given the average growth rate during non-breakout phases across recent high-volume cycles, a moderate increase from the Period 34 level is predicted as the demand stabilizes at this new 3300-3400 unit plateau.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau reached at Period 33-34: Average demand has transitioned to the 3300-3400 unit range, representing a 14% increase over the Period 30-32 average of 2975 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'breakout-correction-recovery' cycle. Following a peak at Period 33 (3391 units), demand entered a two-period correction phase, dropping to 3368 and then 3282 units. Historically, similar corrections (e.g., P10, P20, P28) are followed by a recovery period that either returns demand to the previous peak level or establishes a new growth leg. Specifically, after the P28 correction, Period 29 saw a recovery of +171 units. A similar recovery from the P35 low (3282) toward the established plateau of ~3400 units is anticipated. I expect a recovery of approximately 110-140 units as demand stabilizes within the 3300-3450 range.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge correction duration confirmed: Significant demand peaks (P9, P19, P27, P33) are followed by 1-3 periods of decline/stabilization before the next growth phase, with the current P33-P35 cycle showing a 3.2% cumulative correction.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a well-documented 'breakout-correction' cycle. Historically, major peaks (e.g., P9, P19, P27, P33) are followed by 2-3 periods of consolidation or slight contraction before a new growth phase begins. In the current cycle, following the peak at P33 (3391), demand dipped in P34 and P35 (reaching 3282) before rebounding in P36 to 3448 units. This P36 rebound (+166 units, +5%) signals the end of the consolidation phase and the start of a new upward move, mirroring previous recoveries (like P21-P24 or P29-P31). Given the long-term upward trajectory and the pattern of established demand floors after corrections, I anticipate a continued increase as the product moves toward a new ceiling, likely in the 3550-3650 range.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase initiated at Period 36: Following a 3-period consolidation (P33-P35), demand rebounded by 166 units (+5.1%), signaling the end of the latest breakout-correction cycle and the launch of a new upward trend.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward 'stair-step' trajectory characterized by significant surges followed by shorter consolidation phases. Period 37 recorded a significant surge to 3748 units (+300 units from Period 36), which aligns with the historical pattern where breakthroughs into new volume tiers (previously 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000) are followed by immediate stabilization or minor corrections. Historically, surges exceeding 240 units (e.g., P19, P27, P33) result in a period where demand growth slows significantly or contracts by 1-3%. Given the magnitude of the P37 jump, I anticipate Period 38 will enter a consolidation phase. Evidence from P33-P35 and P24-P26 suggests the demand typically holds near the new peak or pulls back slightly before the next leg up. I am forecasting a slight stabilization/minor growth around the 3800 level, representing a cooling of the recent momentum while respecting the established support floor established in P37.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase confirmed at P37: Demand surged by 300 units (+8.7%) to establish a new ceiling at 3748, marking the end of the P33-P35 consolidation and confirming a new demand floor above the 3400 level.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term aggressive growth pattern, recently moving from a consolidation phase (P33-P35) into a new breakout phase. Demand surged from 3282 (P35) to 3929 (P38), representing a 19.7% increase over three periods. However, the growth rate slowed from +8.7% (P36-P37) to +4.8% (P37-P38). Historical patterns (P24-P26, P33-P35) indicate that after 2-3 periods of significant double-digit growth or combined gains exceeding ~400 units, the product typically enters a stabilization or minor contraction phase. Given the current 647-unit gain over the last three periods, a transition into a 'consolidation' mode is expected for Period 39, characterized by a return to a lower growth rate or flat demand near the 4000-unit threshold.

Carry-over insight: New demand ceiling established at Period 38 (3929 units). Pattern of 'surge-taper-consolidate' remains consistent: current 3-period growth phase (P36-P38) added 647 units, mirroring previous major expansions (e.g., P22-P24) before entering flat or corrective cycles.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'breakout-correction' cycle. Historically, whenever demand surges by more than 240 units in a single period or concludes a multi-period growth streak of ~600+ units, it is followed by a stabilization or correction phase. Relevant historical precedents include: P9 (963 units) followed by P10 (863 units, -10.3%), P19 (2075 units) followed by P20 (1973 units, -4.9%), and P27 (2890 units) followed by P28 (2643 units, -8.5%). Period 39 just reached an all-time high of 4212 units, completing a 4-period growth streak (P36-P39) that added 930 units. This is the most aggressive expansion in the dataset. Following the 'breakout-correction' logic established in Period 29's insights, a correction of approximately 5-7% is expected. A 6% correction from 4212 units results in 3959 units, which aligns with the demand floor established in Period 38 (3929 units).

Carry-over insight: Aggressive growth phase (P36-P39) confirmed: Demand surged by 930 units (+28%) over four periods, the longest consecutive growth streak recorded, establishing a new peak at 4212 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered its most aggressive growth phase to date, spanning five consecutive periods (P36-P40) with a total increase of 1,179 units (+35.9%). Period 40 reached a new peak of 4,461 units, growing by 249 units (+5.9%) over Period 39. Historically, major surges (P9, P19, P27, P33) are followed by a 'breakout-correction' cycle where demand either contracts or stabilizes for 1-3 periods. Specifically, after reaching significant new plateaus like the current one, the growth rate typically slows or undergoes a minor correction of 3-6% (as seen in P33-P35). Given the unprecedented length of the current 5-period growth streak, a deceleration or a slight stabilization period is highly probable. I am forecasting a slight stabilization at the current level, allowing for a marginal increase consistent with mid-growth consolidation patterns.

Carry-over insight: Longest growth streak confirmed (P36-P40): Demand has increased for 5 consecutive periods, totaling +1179 units (+35.9%), surpassing the previous 4-period growth record and establishing a new demand ceiling at 4461 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a consistent long-term growth trend characterized by 'breakout-correction' cycles. Historically, significant growth streaks (like the 5-period rally from P36 to P40) are followed by a correction or consolidation phase. In Period 41, demand dropped from 4461 to 4166 units (-6.6%). Similar historical corrections after major surges (P10, P20, P28) typically last 1 to 3 periods before growth resumes. Specifically, in the P27-P29 cycle, a -8.5% drop in P28 was followed by a partial recovery in P29. Given the strength of the previous expansion (+35.9% over 5 periods), Period 42 is likely to represent a stabilization phase. I expect demand to level off or recover slightly from the P41 dip as the new floor is established around the 4100-4250 range.

Carry-over insight: New consolidation cycle initiated at Period 41: Following the record 5-period growth streak (+35.9%), demand entered a correction phase with a 6.6% decline, mirroring previous post-surge pullbacks (P10, P20, P28).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a consolidation phase following a record 5-period growth streak that peaked at 4461 units in Period 40. Historically, major surges are followed by 1-3 periods of contraction or stabilization. We have seen two consecutive periods of decline (P41: -6.6%, P42: -3.0%). Comparing this to the P33-P35 cycle (which saw a 3.2% cumulative correction over 2 periods before a trend reversal) and the P28 correction (which lasted 1-2 periods before recovery), Period 43 is likely the stage for a stabilization or a slight rebound as the new demand floor is established around the 4000-unit mark. I anticipate the demand will stabilize slightly above the Period 42 level but remain below the recent peak.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation phase (P41-P42) confirmed: Following the record 5-period growth streak, demand has contracted by 9.4% over two periods, consistent with historical 'surge-correction' cycles that typically last 2-3 periods before establishing a new growth floor.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a correction phase following a record 5-period growth streak (P36-P40) that peaked at 4461 units. Historical analysis shows that significant surges are followed by stabilization or corrective cycles lasting 1-3 periods (e.g., P10, P20-21, P34-35). As of Period 43, demand has contracted for three consecutive periods (-6.6%, -3.0%, and -2.2%), which aligns with the upper limit of typical correction durations. The deceleration in the percentage decline suggests demand is nearing a new support floor. Historically, once a correction concludes, the trend pivots back to growth. Given that P43 (3950) has returned to the volume level seen at the start of the final surge leg (P38: 3929), Period 44 is expected to mark the initiation of a new upward trend, consistent with the 'surge-correction-rebound' cycle observed throughout the product's history.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge correction period 3 (P41-P43) reached a cumulative 11.5% decline from the peak, establishing a potential new demand floor near the 3900-4000 unit range before the next growth cycle.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has historically followed a 'surge-correction-growth' cycle. Recently, demand completed a record 5-period growth streak ending at Period 40 (4461 units), followed by a 3-period correction (P41-P43) that dropped demand to 3950 units (an 11.5% decline). Period 44 saw a sharp rebound to 4444 units (+12.5%), mirroring previous cycles where demand recovers aggressively after a 3-period consolidation phase (e.g., P36). Historically, when a new growth phase is initiated after a correction, the first two periods of the rebound show significant upward momentum (average +5% to +8%). Given the strong recovery in P44 back toward the previous peak, I expect Period 45 to continue this momentum and potentially set a new demand ceiling.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase initiated at Period 44: Following a 3-period consolidation (P41-P43), demand rebounded by 494 units (+12.5%), signaling the start of a new upward trend after establishing a floor at ~3950.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis of the 'chips(Regular)' demand reveals a consistent 'breakout-correction' cycle. Following a record 5-period growth streak ending at P40 (4461 units), the demand underwent a 3-period correction (P41-P43), establishing a new floor at approximately 3950 units. Period 44 marked the start of a new growth phase with a significant rebound (+494 units to 4444), followed by a minor consolidation in Period 45 (-80 units to 4364). Historically, large rebounds (e.g., P11, P22, P29, P37) typically precede secondary surges or steady growth as the market establishes a new ceiling. While P45 was a slight pullback, it mirrors the 'taper' often seen inside growth clusters (like P32 or P34). Given the current upward trajectory after establishing the ~4000 baseline, P46 is expected to resume the growth trend, targeting the previous peak level near 4500-4600.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase dynamics (P44-P45): Following the P41-P43 correction, a significant rebound in P44 (+494 units) established a new local floor. Current behavior suggests a more volatile growth-taper rhythm compared to previous cycles, but the long-term upward trajectory remains intact.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a long-term 'breakout-correction' growth pattern. Historical data shows that following a multi-period surge (such as the record 5-period growth from P36-P40), the demand enters a consolidation or correction phase (P41-P43). A new growth phase was initiated at Period 44 (+494 units). Subsequent periods (P45, P46) show typical 'surge-taper' behavior: a slight contraction in P45 (-80 units) followed by a rebound in P46 (+166 units). In previous cycles, once a recovery starts, it tends to progress in stair-step increases or small clusters of growth. Period 46 (4530 units) surpassed the previous historical peak of Period 40 (4461 units), confirming a new upward breakout. Based on the most recent cycle dynamics where growth segments last 2-3 periods before a minor taper, and knowing the demand floor has moved to ~4400-4500, I expect the upward momentum from Period 46 to continue moderately into Period 47.

Carry-over insight: New demand ceiling confirmed at Period 46 (4530 units), surpassing the previous P40 peak. The growth phase initiated at P44 has successfully established a new higher baseline above 4400 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by aggressive growth phases followed by 2-3 period consolidation cycles. After the significant correction from the Period 40 peak (4461) down to the Period 43 floor (3950), a new growth phase was initiated in Period 44. Recent demand (P44-P47) has established a new baseline above 4400 units, with Period 47 reaching a new all-time high of 4595. Historically, when the demand breaks its previous ceiling and shows two consecutive periods of growth (as seen in P46-P47), it typically maintains momentum for a 3-4 period streak before a major correction. Given the momentum from the last two periods (+166 units and +65 units respectively), I expect a continued but potentially stabilizing upward movement for Period 48 to test the 4650-4750 range.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase confirmed (P44-P47): Demand has recovered from the Period 43 trough (3950) to reach a new all-time high of 4595, establishing a 4-period average of 4483 units (+13% above the previous consolidation floor).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'surge-correction' pattern with an overarching upward trend. After a correction floor was established in Period 43 (3950 units), demand entered a new growth phase. Specifically, the last five periods (P44-P48) have shown sustained growth: 4444, 4364, 4530, 4595, and 4776. This marks a 5-period growth streak, matching the longest previous streak recorded (P36-P40). Historically, these extended growth cycles often terminate or enter a stabilization/correction phase after reaching a significant new peak and a 5-period duration. Period 48 reached an all-time high of 4776. Given the pattern where surges exceeding +200 units (like the +181 jump in P48) are frequently followed by a stabilization or a minor 'tapering' correction of 1-3%, I anticipate demand will stabilize near the current peak rather than surging aggressively further.

Carry-over insight: Extended growth streak (P44-P48) confirmed: Demand has increased for five consecutive periods, matching the previous record duration and establishing a new demand ceiling at 4776 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a robust long-term upward trend characterized by 'growth streaks' followed by 'consolidation/correction' phases. Demand has increased for six consecutive periods (P44-P49), recently moving from 4444 to 5087 units, totaling a gain of 1137 units (+28.7%) in this phase. This current streak has now surpassed the length of the previous record 5-period growth streak (P36-P40). Historically, when growth streaks reach 5-6 periods or hit a major surge (like the +311 jump in P49), demand enters a consolidation or mild contraction phase (e.g., P10, P20, P28, P41). Given P49's significant breakout above the 5000-unit threshold and the extended duration of the current run, a stabilization or slight pullback is expected for Period 50. I anticipate demand to settle slightly below the P49 peak as it establishes a new support level, consistent with the observed 'surge-then-stabilize' pattern.

Carry-over insight: New growth streak record: Demand has increased for 6 consecutive periods (P44-P49), surpassing the previous 5-period record and establishing a new demand ceiling above 5000 units (+14.5% over the last 6 periods).
