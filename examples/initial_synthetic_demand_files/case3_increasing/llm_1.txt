Moving from ~4,200 to a new target mean of ~4,500 units/period is appropriate given the consistent growth. (c) Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P36 order arrived P40). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P37 (2150), P38 (4100), P39 (4500), and P40 (6500), totaling 17,250 units. We need to cover demand for Periods 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45 (L+1 periods) to ensure availability when the P41 order arrives in P45. (e) Final order logic: Forecasted demand for the next 5 periods (41-45) at a mean of 4,500/period with a slight growth buffer = 23,000 units. Total pipeline (17,250) + On-hand (0) = 17,250.
