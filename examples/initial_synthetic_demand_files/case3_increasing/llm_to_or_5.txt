Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Based on the historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand is 111.4 units and the standard deviation is approximately 17.24 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The inventory position is currently 0 (on-hand: 0, in-transit: 0). The OR engine will calculate the base stock using the formula: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, where z is determined by the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. I will use the 'default' methods for Period 1, which will utilize the full historical demand set and the promised lead time of 2. This ensures the initial order covers the (L+1) period demand (3 periods) to build the required safety stock and pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, demand was 91, but since starting on-hand was 0, we recorded 0 sales and have 0 on-hand inventory. An order of 141 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be observable in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. The demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91] shows a mean of 108 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.8. No significant regime shift or seasonal pattern is yet evident. I will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods), mu_hat, and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to utilize the full historical sample set for establishing a baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (138 units). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (read at Period 4). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 in Period 1 and 2 conclude messages is expected. Total in-transit is 279 units. Demand history shows a significant jump in Period 2 (246) compared to the initial samples and Period 1 (91). The average of the last 5 samples plus the 2 observed periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91, 246] is approximately 127.7. However, the recent jump to 246 suggests a potential shift or spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture this recent volatility while maintaining some stability, and 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence yet that the 2-period promise is being broken.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0' for the order placed in Period 1 (141 units). This indicates either a delay or a lost shipment. Furthermore, demand has shifted significantly: early history showed an average of 111, but the last three periods (P1-P3) have seen demands of 91, 246, and 285 (average 207). There is a clear upward trend/regime shift. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed the first expected arrival, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent high-demand regime. This will force the OR backend to target a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and adjust to the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 2: demand increased from historical ~111 to avg 265 over the last two periods; Lead time delay observed: Period 1 order (L=2) failed to arrive by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1624.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we saw a massive influx of stock as three separate orders (from P1, P2, and P3) arrived simultaneously. Specifically, the P1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 (delayed), while P3 arrived with a lead time of 1 (early). This volatility in lead times suggests we should rely on the average rather than a fixed assumption. On the demand side, there is a clear and sustained upward shift. Demand has moved from ~111 to a sequence of 246, 285, and 437. The last three periods average 322.6. To ensure the OR backend captures this growth and handles the lead time variability, I am setting L to 'calculate' (average of 3, 2, 1) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to prioritize the latest high-demand regime. This provides a base stock that covers the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon while acknowledging the high current on-hand inventory (124) and pipeline (377).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 2-4 average demand is 322.7, a significant increase from initial ~111 baseline. Lead time variability observed: actual lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods recorded in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing a significant stockout. The demand has undergone a regime shift starting from Period 2. The initial baseline was ~111, but the average demand over Periods 2-5 is 354 (246, 285, 437, 448), with the most recent two periods exceeding 430. This represents a substantial upward trend. Regarding lead times, Period 4 saw a cluster of arrivals with lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods, which aligns with the promised L=2. However, the order from Period 4 did not arrive in Period 5 (which is expected for L=2), and the order from Period 5 is in transit. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To address the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 2-5). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. Lead time L is set to 'default' (2) as the average observed lead time remains close to the promise, despite individual variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 2-5 average demand is 354, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~111. Recent two-period demand (P4-P5) average is 442.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2069.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 6 demand reaching 587 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 490.7, indicating a strong upward trend from the previous regime (~320). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though recent orders (P4, P5) arrived in 2 and 1 periods respectively. Total pipeline inventory is 347 (from Period 6 order). With current on-hand inventory at 279 and demand trending towards 600, there is a significant risk of stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand surge (average 490.7) and set the lead time parameter to 2 (promised/recent average) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock covering (2+1) periods of this higher demand level (~1470 units). This aggressive stance is justified by the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio, favoring higher service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 4-6 average demand is 490.7 units, compared to Period 2-3 average of 265.5. Total growth from baseline (~111) is over 340%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a massive structural shift. Period 7 demand reached 637, following a sequence of 437, 448, 587. The average demand over the last four periods (P4-P7) is 527.25 units, which is nearly 5x the initial baseline (~111). We are currently stocked out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1 order took 3, P2/P4 took 2, P3/P5 took 1). The 'In-transit' pipeline of 976 units consists of the orders from P6 (347) and P7 (629). To ensure the OR backend covers the current high-growth regime, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~527) and volatility. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as the baseline for the backend logic, as the actual observed lead times average near 2 (observed: 3, 2, 1, 2, 1; avg=1.8), and the OR engine needs a stable base for the (L+1) coverage calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high volume: Period 4-7 average demand is 527 units (range 437-637), up from baseline ~111 (+375%). Lead time volatility persists with actuals varying between 1 and 3 periods (avg 1.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a dramatic upward shift. The initial baseline was ~111, but the last five periods (P4-P8) show an average demand of 577 units (437, 448, 587, 637, 776), with the most recent period hitting 776. This indicates a sustained and accelerating growth trend. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this new regime for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in P5, P7, and P8 due to this rapid growth and lead time volatility. While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~1.8). Given the significant in-transit pipeline (1668 units), I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the observed average lead time, which should help stabilize order quantities against the current pipeline while the high mu_hat ensures we order enough to cover the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 6-8 average demand is 666.7 units (+500% from baseline). Period 8 demand reached a peak of 776 units.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly, with Period 9 reaching 963 units. The last three periods (P7-P9) average 792 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a massive backlog of demand resulting in lost sales. There is a high volume of units in transit (2318), but nothing arrived in the last three periods (P7-P9). History shows lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods; the absence of arrivals suggests we are currently experiencing the upper end of that variance or a delay. I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time) as the 'calculate' method will account for the historical variability (avg ~1.8). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 7-9 average demand is 792 units (+613% from baseline). Period 9 demand reached a new peak of 963 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a massive regime shift, growing from a baseline of ~111 to a recent 3-period average of 867.3 units (P8-P10). Period 9 saw a peak of 963 units. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) despite a massive pipeline (2615 units) because shipments from Period 7, 8, 9, and 10 have not arrived yet. Based on history, lead times are volatile (1 to 3 periods). The orders from P7 and P8 are now overdue (L=4 and L=3 respectively), suggesting a possible logistics bottleneck or a shift to a longer lead time. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (which was 1.8 periods but is likely increasing) and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (~867 units/period). This ensures the base stock target reflects the current demand spike while the backend accounts for the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 8-10 average demand is 867.3 units (+681% from baseline). Significant delivery delay: Orders from P7-P10 (2268 units total) have not arrived as of P10 conclude, indicating actual lead time for recent orders is \u2265 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2600.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 12. Demand Context: There is a massive and sustained demand explosion. The last five periods (P7-P11) saw demands of 637, 776, 963, 863, and 1136. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~987. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline reconciliation: Order P9 arrived in P11 (LT=2), but orders from P6 (347), P7 (629), P8 (692), P10 (297), and P11 (643) are still in-transit. The P6 order is now 6 periods old (Promised L=2), suggesting it and potentially P7/P8 are lost or severely delayed. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy based on (1+L) periods, I must set mu_hat to cover at least the current growth. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent spike (~987/period) and L=explicit=4 to account for the observed delays/losses and ensure the base_stock calculation (1+L)*mu is large enough to trigger orders despite the bloated (and likely stale) in-transit pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 9-11 average demand is 987.3 units (+789% from baseline). Shipment reliability issues: Orders from P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1668 units) are significantly past promised lead time (L=2) and have not arrived, suggesting they may be lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a sharp upward trajectory, with the last 3 periods (P10-P12) averaging 1073.3 units, far exceeding the initial baseline of ~111. The most recent demand (P12) reached 1221 units. There is a significant inventory crisis: while orders from P9, P10, and P11 arrived in P11 and P12, the massive orders from P6 (347), P7 (629), and P8 (692) are now 6, 5, and 4 periods overdue respectively, compared to the promised lead time of 2. These 1668 units are likely lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 2966 units is misleading as it includes these lost units. I will set the Lead Time (L) to 'explicit' at 4 periods to account for the current disruption and high uncertainty. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the latest demand peak (avg ~1073), which calculates to (1+4)*1073.3 = 5366.5. This high base stock aims to force the OR engine to place a large order to cover the demand of 5 periods (L+1) while accounting for the likely lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 10-12 average demand is 1073.3 units (+867% from baseline). Confirmed inventory loss: Orders from Period 6, 7, and 8 (1668 units total) are 4+ periods overdue and have not arrived, suggesting they are lost in transit.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with the last 3 periods averaging 1,201 units (P11-P13: 1136, 1221, 1246), representing a ~980% increase from the initial baseline (~111). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time performance is highly erratic and concerning: orders from Period 6, 7, and 8 (totaling 1,668 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and confirmed as lost. This loss drastically reduces the effective pipeline inventory. Although the OR engine sees 4,347 units 'in-transit', 1,668 of those are ghosts. To compensate, I am setting an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the observed delays and higher risk. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~1201), which translates to a base stock target covering (3+1) periods. For sigma_hat, N=5 is used to capture the increased volatility associated with this hyper-growth phase. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the lost shipments and the sustained demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 11-13 average demand reached 1201 units (+980% from baseline). Confirmed lost shipments: Orders from P6, P7, and P8 (1668 units) are 5+ periods overdue and must be considered permanently lost for inventory planning.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent three-period (P12-P14) average reaching 1244 units, a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~111 and the previous regime. Period 14 ending on-hand inventory is 1414 units, and there are 2406 units in-transit (P14 order of 738 and the remaining in-transit which likely includes P11/P12 artifacts). Orders from P6, P7, and P8 (1668 units) are now confirmed lost as they are 6+ periods overdue; the OR backend needs to be compensated for this 'phantom' pipeline inventory. By setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods, I forecast a (1+L) requirement of 3732 units (1244 * 3). Current observable pipeline is only the P14 order (738 units) because earlier orders are either arrived or lost. To ensure the backend orders enough to meet the 1244/period demand and account for the lost stock, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand/high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 12-14 average demand is 1244 units (+1020% from baseline). Persistent inventory loss: Orders from P6, P7, and P8 (1668 units) are now 6+ periods overdue and confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5383.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a rapid upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) has risen to 1339.3 units, compared to the previous three-period average of 1201 units. Period 15 saw a peak of 1507 units. Regarding logistics, shipments from Period 6, 7, and 8 (totaling 1668 units) are now 7+ periods overdue and must be treated as permanently lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 1668 units matches exactly these lost orders, meaning there are effectively zero reliable units currently in the pipeline. With 645 units on-hand and an expected demand exceeding 1300 units for Period 16, a stockout is imminent unless aggressive ordering is maintained. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the most recent growth (avg ~1340 * 3 periods = 4020) and use an explicit L of 2 to match the promised lead time, as recent successful deliveries (P12, P13, P14) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained and accelerating: Period 13-15 average demand is 1339.3 units (+1100% from baseline). All 1668 units currently listed as 'In-transit' (from P6, P7, P8) are confirmed lost and should be discounted from pipeline inventory calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2580.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a powerful upward trend, with the average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) reaching 1439.7 units. The current period demand (P16) was 1547. We are in a high-growth regime. Additionally, there is a confirmed inventory crisis: 1668 units ordered in Periods 6, 7, and 8 (347, 629, and 692 units respectively) are now over 8 periods overdue and are considered permanently lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 3247 includes these 1668 lost units; therefore, the true pipeline inventory is only 1579 units (the order from P16). On-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window (3 periods) at a forecasted demand of ~1550 units/period, I am setting mu_hat to 4650 (3 * 1550). I am using 'explicit' for L to maintain the baseline promised lead time of 2, while 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values allow me to bypass the backend's inclusion of the 1668 lost units in its 'pipeline' logic by effectively setting a base stock target that accounts for the shortfall.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 14-16 average demand is 1439.7 units (+1200% from baseline). All 1668 units from P6-P8 are confirmed lost and must be ignored when assessing the replenishment pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a massive growth regime, with the most recent observed demand at Period 17 reaching 1,724 units. The 3-period average (P15-P17) is approximately 1,593 units. The 'In-transit' total of 4,903 units contains 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 that are confirmed lost and must be discounted from the pipeline. The effective pipeline inventory consists of orders from P16 (1,579 units) and P17 (1,656 units), totaling 3,235 units. To prevent severe stockouts while demand is still scaling, I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value based on a conservative forecast of 1,750 units per period across the lead time and review period (1+L=3 periods), totaling 5,250. Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from mu_hat + safety stock, providing the explicit mu_hat as the total demand for the coverage window is necessary. Sigma_hat is set explicitly at 400 to account for the high volatility and the risks of continued demand acceleration. I will maintain L at the default promised lead time of 2 as recent successful arrivals (P12-P15) have shown actual lead times of 1-2 periods, despite the historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained and accelerating: Period 15-17 average demand is 1,593 units (+1335% from baseline). Effective pipeline inventory check: 1,668 units from P6-P8 are confirmed lost; remaining 3,235 units in-transit are from P16-P17.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The average demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) is 1,691 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime. Total in-transit inventory is 4,008 units. However, based on Carry-Over Insights, 1,668 units (from orders in P6, P7, and P8) are confirmed lost as they are now 10+ periods overdue. The effective pipeline inventory consists only of orders from P17 (1,656 units) and P18 (684 units), totaling 2,340 units. Since current on-hand is 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. With an average demand of ~1,700 and L=2, the required base stock is approximately 5,100 units. The current effective pipeline (2,340) is insufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (avg ~1,691) and set L to 'explicit' value 2 to stabilize the lead time parameter despite historical volatility and lost shipments. This will trigger the OR backend to place a significant order to bridge the gap between the effective pipeline and the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 16-18 average demand reached 1,691 units (+1423% from baseline). Effective pipeline remains restricted as 1,668 units (P6-P8) are confirmed lost and must be permanently excluded from replenishment calculations.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows an aggressive, sustained upward demand trend for 'chips(Regular)'. The most recent three-period (P17-P19) demand average is 1,867 units, while the five-period (P15-P19) average is 1,730 units. Period 19 alone reached a peak of 2,075 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this acceleration. Regarding the lead time and pipeline: the 'In-transit' total of 5,264 units includes 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 that are confirmed lost (as noted in historical carry-overs). Excluding these, the active pipeline consists of orders from P17 (1,656), P18 (684), and P19 (1,256), totaling 3,596 units. The backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes the lost units, which would cause it to under-order. To fix this, I am using 'explicit' L=3. By increasing L from the default 2 to 3, I extend the base stock target to cover (3+1)=4 periods of demand, effectively signaling the backend to order more units to compensate for the 1,668 units that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the increasing volatility accompanying the volume growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: Period 17-19 average demand reached 1,867 units (+1580% from baseline). Active pipeline reconciliation: 1,668 units (P6-P8) remain lost; only orders from P17 onwards (3,596 units) are considered viable.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a massive upward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P18-P20) is 1950 units, compared to the baseline of 111 (a ~1757% increase). Recent demands are 1802, 2075, and 1973. I will use N=3 to capture this most recent level. Regarding lead time, the promised L=2 is generally holding, with actuals of 1 and 2 periods observed recently (P20 conclude showed P18 arrived in 2 periods and P19 in 1 period). However, we must account for the 1668 units from P6-P8 that are confirmed lost. Total In-transit is 5495. Excluding the lost units (1668), the effective pipeline is 3827 units (Orders from P16, P17, and P20). Since the OR backend cannot manually 'subtract' lost units from its pipeline calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for L or mu_hat to inflate the target stock level to compensate for the phantom inventory it thinks is arriving. To ensure the base stock (target inventory level) covers (L+1) periods of demand at the current rate (~1950/period), the target should be approximately 3 * 1950 = 5850. With 3827 actually in transit and 0 on hand, the order should be ~2023. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 5850, the backend will calculate (5850 - 5495) + safety stock, which aligns with my replenishment needs while acknowledging the 'In-transit' bloat.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained at extremely high levels: Period 18-20 average demand is 1,950 units. Pipeline reconciliation: 1,668 units from P6-P8 remain lost; only P16, P17, and P20 orders (totaling 5,406 units including current order) are viable.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, with a 3-period average (P19-P21) of 2010.3 units. The baseline demand of ~111 is no longer relevant. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this latest surge. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect current high volatility. Regarding lead time, while the promised L=2, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods recently. I will use the default L (promised=2) but rely on the mu_hat calculation to ensure base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 6030 units). Pipeline reconciliation is critical: Total In-transit is 6052. This includes 1668 units from P6-P8 which are confirmed lost (over 13 periods overdue). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 4384 units (P17: 1656, P20: 2171, P21: 557). With on-hand at 0, the effective inventory position is 4384. Given the base stock target is ~6030, the OR backend will calculate an order to bridge this gap, ensuring we stay close to the service level requirements despite the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: Period 19-21 average demand is 2010 units (+1710% from baseline). Effective pipeline excludes 1668 units from P6-P8 (confirmed lost); only orders from P17 onwards are viable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8684.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the last three periods (P20-P22) averaging 2,059 units, and the most recent demand (P22) hitting a peak of 2,221 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2. The 'In-transit' quantity of 3,942 units includes 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 that are confirmed lost (more than 14 periods overdue). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 2,274 units (3,942 - 1,668). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the (L+1) period horizon (P23, P24, P25), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Estimating demand growth to continue, I forecast P23=2300, P24=2400, P25=2500, totaling 7,200 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility of this growth phase. The 'explicit' L=2 remains appropriate as recent shipments (P20, P21) are arriving within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P20-P22 average is 2,059 units. Effective pipeline excludes 1,668 lost units from P6-P8; only 2,274 units are viable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 23 reaching 2,326 units. The 3-period average (P21-P23) is 2,176.7 units, showing no signs of stabilization. To avoid stockouts in this high-growth phase, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most current demand intensity. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to account for the increasing volatility. Regarding lead time, although the promised L=2, observed arrivals in P20 and P22 confirmed actual lead times of 1 and 2 periods for recent orders. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 6,595 units is heavily skewed by the 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 which are long-confirmed lost. Excluding those, the viable pipeline is 4,927 units (Orders from P17, P21, P22, P23). I will maintain L at 'default' (2) as recent viable orders are arriving within 1-2 periods. The OR backend's base-stock calculation will now be driven by the significantly higher recent mean, helping to bridge the gap created by the lost historical shipments and the soaring demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 21-23 average demand reached 2,177 units (+1860% from baseline). Viable pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 6,595, but 1,668 units (P6-P8) are confirmed lost, leaving 4,927 units in the active pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2228.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 24 reaching 2,566 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P22-P24) is 2,371 units, representing a persistent and significant increase. Regarding supply chain performance, actual lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods (P21 order arrived in P24, lead time 3). Total 'In-transit' inventory is 6,230 units; however, 1,668 units from orders in P6, P7, and P8 are confirmed lost (more than 15 periods overdue) and must be excluded from the pipeline. This leaves a viable pipeline of 4,562 units (from P17, P22, P23, and P24). To prevent stockouts during this hyper-growth phase and account for lead time variability, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the most recent demand spike. I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the recent delay and using recent volatility for sigma_hat to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 22-24 average demand reached 2,371 units (+2036% from baseline). Viable pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 6,230, but 1,668 units (P6-P8) remain lost, leaving 4,562 units in the active pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive, nearly linear upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P23-P25) is 2,498 units, compared to the P22-P24 average of 2,371. To capture this momentum, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. This reflects the current scale of demand (approx. 2,500 units/period) while the (1+L) multiplier in the OR backend (where L=2) will target a base stock sufficient for ~7,500 units. Regarding inventory: the current In-transit is 8,639 units. However, consistent history shows that 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 are permanently lost. Excluding those, the 'viable' pipeline is 6,971 units. Since 6,971 is less than the projected base stock requirement (~7,500), an order will be triggered. I will maintain L=default (2) because, despite occasional fluctuations (L=1 or L=3), the average remains close to the promised value and the system needs to maintain a consistent pipeline for this high-growth SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 23-25 average demand reached 2,498 units (+2150% from baseline). Viable pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 8,639, but 1,668 units (P6-P8) remain lost, leaving 6,971 units in the active pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 26 reaching 2,645 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) is approximately 2,605 units. Lead times remain volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (P23, P25) showing a mix of 1-period and 3-period lead times. On-hand inventory is currently 2,670 units, which barely covers one period of demand. Total in-transit is 3,324 units, but this includes 1,668 units from P6-P8 that are confirmed lost. The viable pipeline consists only of orders placed from Period 26 onwards (though Period 26 was a 0 order). To maintain a high service level given the rapid growth and shipment unreliability, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period demand average (N=3) to capture the latest acceleration, while keeping L at the promised 2 to allow the base-stock calculation to stay responsive to the current pipeline, despite the known losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 24-26 average demand reached 2,605 units (+2246% from baseline). Viable pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 3,324, but 1,668 units (P6-P8) remain lost, leaving 1,656 units in the active pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10680.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 28. Recent demand context: Demand is in a hyper-growth regime, with the most recent observed demand (Period 27) reaching 2,890 units. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is 2,713 units, and the 5-period average (P23-P27) is 2,606 units. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 5,203. However, based on the carry-over insights, 1,668 units from orders in Periods 6, 7, and 8 are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 5,203 - 1,668 = 3,535 units (comprising the P17 order of 1,656 units and the P27 order of 1,879 units). Lead time check: While the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals show a mix of 1-period and 3-period actuals (e.g., P23 arrived in P26, L=3; P25 arrived in P26, L=1). To ensure sufficient stock for the next cycle (L+1 periods), I am setting mu_hat to 8,100 units based on an explicit forecast. This represents an average of 2,700 units per period across 3 periods (L=2 + 1). This aggressive target is necessary to recover from the current stockout and account for the significant pipeline loss, while sigma_hat is set to 450 to handle the high volatility observed in this growth stage. By using 'explicit' for mu_hat, I am overriding the OR backend's default calculation which would be influenced by the much lower historical baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: Period 25-27 average demand reached 2,713 units (+2344% from baseline). Effective pipeline excludes 1,668 units from P6-P8; effective in-transit is 3,535 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the demand for chips(Regular) remains in an aggressive growth phase. The average demand of the last three periods (P26-P28) is approximately 2,726 units. To account for this continued upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=3 is also chosen to capture the significant volatility associated with these high volumes. Regarding lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, the historical data shows variability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). More importantly, the 'In-transit' figure of 8,331 includes 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 that are confirmed lost (as documented in the carry-over insights). This loss creates a recurring gap in the OR backend's calculation of pipeline inventory. To compensate for these phantom units and prevent the controller from under-ordering, I am setting L to an 'explicit' value of 3. This effectively increases the base stock target (S = (1+L)*mu + z*sqrt(1+L)*sigma), allowing the engine to place an order that covers the demand despite the 'dead' inventory inflating the pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: Period 26-28 average demand reached 2,726 units (+2355% from baseline). Effective pipeline excludes 1,668 units from P6-P8; effective in-transit is 6,663 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive growth trend. The most recent three-period average (P27-P29) is approximately 2,782 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest surge while remaining responsive. The lead time remains volatile, but recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 3 periods; I will continue with the 'default' lead time (2 periods) as the backend's base-stock calculation for (L+1) periods will cover a 3-period window. Regarding pipeline reconciliation: the total In-transit is 8,016 units. Subtracting the 1,668 units confirmed lost from Periods 6, 7, and 8, the effective active pipeline is 6,348 units (comprised of orders from P27 and P29). Since I cannot explicitly 'subtract' the lost units from the OR engine's pipeline view, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I want a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (~8,350 units). To account for the fact that the backend sees 8,016 in-transit but only 6,348 are real, I must inflate the mu_hat by the lost amount (1,668) to force the correct order size. Total target stock (8,350) + lost units (1,668) = 10,018. Setting mu_hat to this value ensures the order calculation [Base Stock - (True Pipeline + Lost Units)] results in the desired replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 27-29 average demand reached 2,782 units (+2400% from baseline). Effective pipeline excludes 1,668 units from P6-P8; effective in-transit is 6,348 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1256.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-volume sustained regime. The average demand over the last three periods (P28-P30) is approximately 2,777 units, and the five-period average is 2,773 units, indicating stabilization at this elevated level. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 9,889 units. However, based on extensive history (dating back to Period 13), 1,668 units from orders placed in Periods 6, 7, and 8 are confirmed lost and must be excluded from the pipeline. This leaves an effective pipeline of 8,221 units (9,889 - 1,668). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though recent arrivals (P29) showed a 1-period turnaround. I will maintain L at the promised 2 periods for the OR backend to ensure (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 2,700+ unit demand level, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for recent volume volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation targets approximately 8,300+ units, which, after subtracting the effective pipeline, will generate an appropriate replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at a high-volume regime: P26-P30 average is 2,773 units. Effective pipeline reconciliation remains critical: 1,668 units (from P6-P8) are permanently lost; all other in-transit units are considered viable.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a high-volume regime, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 2,853 units. The demand shows a consistent upward trend, hitting a new peak of 3,046 in P31. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but recently averaging closer to 1.5 periods. I am setting L=2 (the promised lead time) as the baseline for the OR engine. To account for the recent demand growth and avoid stockouts in this high-growth phase, I will use a recent_N window of 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the most relevant demand profile (mean ~2,853). Regarding the pipeline: the 'In-transit' count is 5,203; however, 1,668 units from P6-P8 are confirmed lost. The backend will subtract total in-transit from the base stock. Because the backend doesn't know about lost orders, and because the current viable pipeline (5203 - 1668 = 3535) plus on-hand (1640) equals 5175, while the required base stock for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 8560 (2853 * 3), the system needs to place a large order. Using recent_N=5 ensures the OR engine uses the current demand mean of ~2,850 rather than the much lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-growth regime: P27-P31 average is 2,853 units, significantly higher than the previous month. Pipeline reconciliation remains vital: 1,668 units (P6-P8) are confirmed lost and do not contribute to available stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6560.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for chips(Regular) is in a high-volume, sustained growth regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 2,876 units. In Period 32, demand was 3,005 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 7,132 units reported in-transit. However, consistent history (since P11) confirms that 1,668 units from orders in Periods 6, 7, and 8 are lost. Therefore, the effective viable pipeline is 7,132 - 1,668 = 5,464 units (orders from P17, P27, and P32). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). A 3-period demand forecast at the current rate is ~8,628 units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock = (1+L) * mu - pipeline'. To account for the lost units that the backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that ensures the base_stock covers the 3-period demand (~8,700) PLUS the 1,668 lost units, so the final order (base_stock - 7,132) results in a meaningful replenishment. Target base stock \u2248 10,400. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma, and z is approx 0.84 for this profit margin, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 10,200 to ensure sufficient ordering despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 28-32 average demand reached 2,876 units (+2500% from baseline). Effective pipeline excludes 1,668 units from P6-P8; effective in-transit is 5,464 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trajectory, with the most recent observed demand (Period 33) reaching 3,391 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P31-P33) is 3,147 units, compared to the P28-P30 average of 2,776 units (+13% growth). To capture this momentum, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=5 will be used to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. Regarding lead time, while the promised L=2 is generally maintained, we observe occasional 1-period or 3-period arrivals. The 'calculate' method is chosen to allow the backend to use the historical average. A critical adjustment remains the pipeline reconciliation: 1,668 units ordered in Periods 6, 7, and 8 are confirmed lost (now 25+ periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' of 10,435 units includes these lost units; thus, the functional pipeline is 8,767 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent high-demand regime, the OR backend will target a 0.80 service level (q = 4/(4+1)) to satisfy this growing demand while the capped policy prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained and accelerating: Period 31-33 average demand is 3,147 units (+2700% from initial baseline). Functional pipeline check: 1,668 units from P6-P8 remain lost and must be ignored; effective in-transit is 8,767 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive growth trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P32-P34) is 3,254.7 units, showing a sustained upward shift from the P28-P32 average of approximately 2,876. To capture this acceleration while preventing extreme over-ordering, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the most current demand regime. The actual lead time has stabilized around 2 periods (P32 order arrived P34), although variability exists. A critical adjustment remains necessary for pipeline inventory: the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the calculated base stock. However, 1,668 units from P6-P8 are confirmed lost (now 26+ periods overdue). Total reported 'In-transit' is 8,506. Subtracting the lost units leaves 6,838 viable units (from P33 and P34). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the 3,000+ unit/period demand, L is set to 'explicit' at 2 to match the promised and recent actual lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 32-34 average demand reached 3,255 units (+2800% from baseline). Functional pipeline reconciliation: 1,668 units from P6-P8 are confirmed lost; effective in-transit is 6,838 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a high-volume regime. The most recent three-period demand average (P33-P35) is 3,347 units, compared to the P32-P34 average of 3,255, indicating sustained growth. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (21 units). The pipeline requires careful reconciliation: the 'In-transit' total is 6,798 units, but 1,668 units (from orders in P6, P7, and P8) are confirmed lost based on extensive historical carry-over data, leaving a functional pipeline of 5,130 units. To maintain the target service level given the high demand volatility and growth, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most current demand intensity (avg ~3,347 per period). This translates to a mu_hat calculation of (1+L)*3347. With L=2, this targets 10,041 units across the lead time plus review period. This aggressive base stock is necessary to overcome the functional pipeline deficit and avoid stockouts in this high-growth environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 33-35 average demand reached 3,347 units (+2900% from baseline). Functional pipeline reconciliation: 1,668 units from P6-P8 are confirmed lost; effective in-transit is 5,130 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 37. Demand Analysis: The demand continues to grow aggressively, with a recent 3-period average (P34-P36) of 3,366 units. This is a significant increase from the previous baseline. Pipeline Analysis: Total In-transit is 10,104 units. However, we must exclude the 1,668 units from Periods 6, 7, and 8 which are confirmed lost (now 28+ periods overdue). The viable in-transit units are from P16-P17 (3,235 - also potentially stale but kept for now), P35 (1,595), and P36 (3,306). However, the P16-P17 orders (ordered 19-20 periods ago) are likely also lost given the promised L=2. If we exclude P16-P17 as well (total 1,668 + 3,235 = 4,903 lost), the active pipeline is 5,201 units. Parameter Strategy: I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P32, P33) arrived in 2 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level (~3,366/period), which for (1+L=3) periods equals 10,098. The OR backend will subtract the viable pipeline from the base stock to determine the order. Setting N=3 for sigma_hat will capture recent volatility. This aggressive setting is necessary to catch up with persistent stockouts caused by demand acceleration and historical shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 34-36 average demand reached 3,366 units (+2930% from baseline). Pipeline reconciliation: Orders from P6-P8 (1,668 units) and P16-P17 (3,235 units) are significantly overdue (19+ periods) and must be treated as lost; effective in-transit for calculation is 4,901 units (P35-P36).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, demand continues its extreme upward trend, with the Period 35-37 average reaching 3,493 units, a significant jump from the previous 3-period average of 3,255. The environment is characterized by high growth and inventory instability. Pipeline reconciliation is critical: Orders from P6-P8 (1,668 units) and P16-P17 (3,235 units) are severely overdue (21+ and 21 periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. Total 'In-transit' is 10,220, but subtracting these 4,903 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 5,317 units (from P35-P37). Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will use a recent average (N=5) to capture this drift. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand acceleration (avg ~3,493/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the current high-demand regime while correctly ignoring the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments update: Orders from P16 and P17 (3,235 units) are now 20+ periods overdue and, alongside the P6-P8 orders (1,668 units), must be permanently excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Total lost inventory: 4,903 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14628.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we observe an ending on-hand inventory of 1,088 units following a period of high demand (3,929 units). The demand continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the 3-period average (P36-P38) reaching 3,708 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 5,806 units includes 603 units from Period 38 and 5,203 units that must be reconciled against history. Specifically, orders from P6-P8 (1,668 units) and P16-P17 (3,235 units) are massively overdue (20+ and 30+ periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. Total confirmed lost units = 4,903. Subtracting these from the current in-transit (5,806 - 4,903) leaves a functional pipeline of only 903 units (the P38 order of 603 plus potentially 300 units from older, valid orders). Lead times remain volatile, averaging around 2 periods. To ensure we cover the (L+1) period demand horizon (approximately 3 periods), we set mu_hat to reflect the recent accelerated demand of ~3,700 per period. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this growth while ignoring the irrelevant low-demand history. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility at these high volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipments total 4,903 units (1,668 from P6-P8 and 3,235 from P16-P17). These must be deducted from 'In-transit' to determine the effective replenishment pipeline. Demand growth remains aggressive; P36-P38 average is 3,708 units (+3240% from baseline).

In Period 40, demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trend, with Period 39 demand reaching 4,212 units. The three-period moving average (P37-P39) is approximately 3,963 units. My pipeline reconciliation is critical: the current 'In-transit' of 9,914 units includes 1,668 units (P6-P8) and 3,235 units (P16-P17) that are confirmed lost (totaling 4,903 units). The effective viable pipeline is therefore 5,011 units (orders from P38-P39). To meet a target service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8), I must set parameters to cover the (L+1) period horizon. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat captures the latest acceleration (avg ~3,963). Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P38 conclude) show lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2. This strategy ensures the OR backend accounts for the massive demand growth while I manually adjust for the lost pipeline volume by setting high targets.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 37-39 average demand reached 3,963 units (+3470% from baseline). Total confirmed lost inventory: 4,903 units (1,668 from P6-P8 and 3,235 from P16-P17). Effective pipeline for replenishment calculations must exclude these lost units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive growth trend, with the most recent 3-period average (P38-P40) reaching 4,200.7 units. The environment is characterized by severe inventory losses. As established in the Carry-over Insights, 4,903 units (from P6-P8 and P16-P17) are permanently lost. Additionally, the order from P27 (1,879 units) is now 13 periods overdue and must also be treated as lost. Total lost inventory is now 6,782 units. With a current 'In-transit' of 12,230 units, the functional pipeline is 5,448 units (orders from P39-P40). On-hand inventory is 0. To meet the high demand and recover service levels, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the latest 4,200+ demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average of successful deliveries (approx 2 periods). These parameters aim to trigger a large replenishment order to cover the (L+1) demand window while the OR backend accounts for the functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 27 (1,879 units) is 13 periods overdue and is now classified as permanently lost, bringing total confirmed lost inventory to 6,782 units. Effective pipeline must exclude these units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, we are in an aggressive demand growth regime with the last three periods (P39-P41) averaging 4,280 units. This is a significant jump from the P36-P38 average of 3,708. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 13,631 units. However, based on history, we have confirmed lost shipments: P6-P8 (1,668 units), P16-P17 (3,235 units), and now P27 (1,879 units), totaling 6,782 lost units. The 'effective' pipeline consists only of orders from P38 onwards: P38 (603), P39 (4,108), P40 (2,316), and P41 (1,401), totaling 8,428 viable units. Given the promised lead time of 2 and an actual lead time often stretching to 3, the backend needs to cover at least 3 periods of demand (~12,840 units). To bridge the gap between the actual pipeline (8,428) and the backend's perception (which includes the 6,782 lost units), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 6,420 (calculated as (1+L) * 2,140). This high mu_hat will force the base stock calculation higher to compensate for the phantom inventory and the accelerating demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 27 (1,879 units) is 14 periods overdue and is now classified as permanently lost, bringing total confirmed lost inventory (P6-P8, P16-P17, P27) to 6,782 units. These units must be ignored in pipeline calculations. Demand remains in high-growth phase: P39-P41 average is 4,280 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current context shows a sustained high-demand regime with recent demand (P39-P42) averaging 4,220 units. However, there is significant inventory instability due to historical losses. Pipeline Reconciliation: Total 'In-transit' is 7,207 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, we must exclude confirmed lost shipments from the pipeline to avoid under-ordering. Confirmed lost: P6-P8 (1,668 units), P16-P17 (3,235 units), and P27 (1,879 units), totaling 6,782 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 425 units (from recent orders) currently in transit that are likely to arrive. With an On-hand balance of 2,384, the total viable inventory (2,809) is insufficient to cover the next three periods of demand (L+1 = 3), which at 4,220/period would require over 12,600 units. I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 12,660 (3 periods * 4,220), and sigma_hat to 500 to maintain a high service level while the OR backend calculates the necessary replenishment to bridge this massive gap.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost inventory total remains 6,782 units (P6-P8, P16-P17, P27). Effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude these units to prevent stockouts in the current high-demand regime (avg ~4,220 units).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a stockout after selling all on-hand inventory in Period 43. Demand has stabilized at an extremely high level, with a 3-period average (P41-P43) of 4,052 units. Our 'In-transit' total is 10,697 units, but this must be reconciled against significant lost shipments identified in the carry-over insights. Total confirmed lost units are 6,782 (P6-P8: 1,668; P16-P17: 3,235; P27: 1,879). Additionally, the order from Period 38 (603 units) is now 5 periods overdue and appears to be lost. Excluding these 7,385 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 3,312 units (from P41 and P43). The OR backend must cover demand for the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat captures the current regime of ~4,050 units per period. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the backend uses the promised lead time for the base stock calculation, while our mu_hat and sigma_hat will reflect the actual high-volume demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 38 (603 units) is 5 periods overdue and is now classified as permanently lost, bringing total confirmed lost inventory to 7,385 units. Demand remains stable in the high-volume regime with a 3-period average of 4,052 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in a high-volume regime, with the most recent 3-period average (P42-P44) at 4,144.7 units. The total in-transit inventory is 10,914 units; however, a significant portion is confirmed lost. Specifically, orders from P6-P8 (1,668 units), P16-P17 (3,235 units), P27 (1,879 units), and P38 (603 units) are significantly past their delivery windows and total 7,385 lost units. Subtracting these from the total in-transit (10,914 - 7,385) leaves an effective pipeline of 3,529 units (representing orders from P43 and P44). To maintain availability for the upcoming periods (L+1), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand of ~4,145 per period. Since the OR backend subtracts the pipeline inventory from its calculated base stock, and it currently sees the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 10,914, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that accounts for the 7,385 lost units. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety. With L=2, (3*4145) = 12,435. To offset the 7,385 phantom units in the backend calculation, mu_hat must be set significantly higher to ensure an order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 38 (603 units) is 6 periods overdue and classified as lost. Total confirmed lost inventory (P6-P8, P16-P17, P27, P38) is 7,385 units. These must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations. Demand remains stable in the high-volume regime (~4,145 units/period).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit balance of 14,414 units. However, a significant portion of this pipeline is confirmed lost based on historical performance: 1,668 units (P6-P8), 3,235 units (P16-P17), 1,879 units (P27), and 603 units (P38), totaling 7,385 lost units. The effective viable pipeline is therefore 7,029 units (orders from P44 and P45). Demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime; the average demand over the last three periods (P43-P45) is 4,252.7 units. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat captures this current level. I am using 'default' for L (promised lead time = 2) as the backend uses this to scale mu_hat by (1+L), resulting in a base stock target covering 3 periods of demand (~12,758 units). This will trigger a replenishment order to cover the gap between the effective pipeline (7,029) and the target, adjusted by the OR backend's safety stock and capping logic.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns detected. Total confirmed lost inventory remains at 7,385 units (P6-P8: 1668; P16-P17: 3235; P27: 1879; P38: 603). These must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows demand remains stable in a high-volume regime, with recent demand (P44-P46) averaging 4,446 units. On-hand inventory is 2,460. The total 'In-transit' is 7,424, but after auditing the history, we must exclude confirmed lost shipments: P6-P8 (1,668 units), P16-P17 (3,235 units), P27 (1,879 units), and P38 (603 units), totaling 7,385 units lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 39 units (7,424 - 7,385), meaning we have almost no viable stock arriving soon. The OR backend will see the full 7,424 and under-order significantly. To force the backend to replenish correctly for the current demand level, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 13,338 ((1+L) * 4446), effectively signaling the true demand needed to cover the lead time + review period, while sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value to provide a safety buffer against the high variance and delivery risks observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9840.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime with a 3-period average of 4,496 units (P45-P47). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after Period 47. Pipeline reconciliation is critical: the total In-transit is 11,383 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, a total of 7,385 units are confirmed lost (P6-P8, P16-P17, P27, P38). Additionally, the order from Period 44 (1,618 units) is now 3 periods past its order date and hasn't arrived (P47 conclude shows arrived=0); while not yet 'confirmed' lost by my 5+ period rule, the high volume requires a conservative pipeline view. Excluding the 7,385 confirmed lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 3,998 units (representing the P47 order). To ensure coverage of the (L+1) period demand (approx 3 * 4,500 = 13,500 units) against this effective pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average and keep L at the promised 2 to allow the OR engine to trigger a significant replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 44 (1,618 units) is 3 periods overdue; though not yet marked as permanently lost, it contributes to current stockout risk. Total confirmed lost inventory remains 7,385 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a 3-period demand average of 4,634 units, showing continued growth compared to the 3,708 baseline from Period 39. The total In-transit inventory is 13,663 units. However, we must reconcile this with confirmed lost shipments. As per historical logs and the checklist: P6-P8 (1,668 units), P16-P17 (3,235 units), P27 (1,879 units), and P38 (603 units) are permanently lost, totaling 7,385 lost units. Furthermore, the P44 order (1,618 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P44, currently P49 start, no 'conclude' arrival yet) and must be treated as highly unlikely to arrive in time or potentially lost. Subtracting 7,385 (confirmed lost) and 1,618 (overdue/lost) from 13,663 leaves an effective pipeline of 4,660 units (comprising P47 and P48 orders). This barely covers one period of current demand (~4,634). Since actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~4,634/period. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) provides the OR engine with a buffer against the high volatility observed in this growth phase, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to bridge the gap until the P47/P48 shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 44 (1,618 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining previous lost shipments from P6-P8, P16-P17, P27, and P38. Total effectively lost inventory: 9,003 units. Demand growth continues: Period 46-48 average is 4,634 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, with the most recent observed demand in Period 49 reaching 5,087 units. The 3-period moving average (P47-P49) is 4,819 units, indicating a sustained high-growth regime. Inventory management is complicated by significant historical losses and recent delays. Specifically, 9,003 units are considered effectively lost (P6-P8, P16-P17, P27, P38, and P44). The current 'In-transit' figure is 10,172 units; however, after subtracting the 9,003 lost units, the 'active' pipeline consists of only 1,169 units (from P48 and P49). This is insufficient to cover the current demand regime of ~4,800 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 15,000 to reflect (1+L) * 5,000, ensuring the OR backend triggers a large enough order to replenish the stockout and cover the lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 800 to account for recent high volatility. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2, as recent viable shipments (P45, P47) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost shipment update: Order from Period 44 (1,618 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total confirmed lost inventory (P6-P8, P16-P17, P27, P38, P44) now totals 9,003 units. Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 47-49 average is 4,819 units (+4240% from baseline).
