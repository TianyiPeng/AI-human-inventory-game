Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit for 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand over the past 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], which gives an average of 111.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now are intended to arrive during this same period to satisfy current demand. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target (critical ratio) is 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which the OR backend will calculate using my provided parameters. I will use the 'default' method for lead time (0) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent mean (~111.4) and standard deviation (~17.5). This approach ensures we order enough to cover the expected demand of the current period immediately while accounting for historical variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 91, which is fairly consistent with the historical mean of approximately 111.4 (from the past 5 samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94). Given only one period of live data and the 5 historical samples, there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or seasonal spike. The current on-hand inventory is 36 units. To maintain safety stock and cover the current period's demand (lead time 0 means we need to cover 1+0=1 period), I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat, but I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (5 historical + 1 live) to incorporate the latest observation. Since the sample size is small and variance exists (range 91-138), the OR backend's base-stock calculation (standard q-ratio) will handle the balance between the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, starting from 0, an order was placed and arrived immediately (L=0), leaving 36 units. In Period 2, an order of 87 was placed and arrived immediately (L=0). Total on-hand became 123 (36 + 87). However, demand spiked significantly to 246, resulting in a stockout (sold=123, ending inventory=0). The historical demand sequence [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] has been superseded by actual game demands of [91, 246]. The average demand over the last two periods is ~168.5, but the P2 value of 246 suggests a potential upward shift or high volatility. Since lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the recent high demand, and explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed between P1 and P2 to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'default' for L as the promised lead time of 0 is currently holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1048.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend over the last three periods (91, 246, 285), far exceeding the initial historical average (~111). This suggests a demand regime shift or a strong seasonal growth trend. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived within the same period). Specifically, Period 2 and 3 both ended with 0 inventory and lost sales (sold < demand), indicating that previous stock levels were insufficient. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness, I will use a short-window 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=3) to focus on this new higher-demand regime. Average demand over the last 3 periods is approx 207 units, which is significantly higher than the training data. Given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will set L to 'default' as 0 is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~111 in historical data to ~207 over Periods 1-3. Current trend is upward (P1:91, P2:246, P3:285).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1176.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is experiencing a sharp, sustained upward trend, significantly exceeding the historical mean. Recent demand values (P1: 91, P2: 246, P3: 285, P4: 437) show a clear regime change compared to the pre-game mean of 111. In Period 4, demand hit 437, resulting in a stockout despite ordering 294 units. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat (average of ~265) and sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. While the historical mean is lower, the recent 4-period average better reflects the current trajectory, though even it may be conservative given the P4 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Mean demand moved from ~111 to ~265 over P1-P4 (91, 246, 285, 437), indicating a high-growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1540.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a very high growth phase, significantly exceeding historical levels and previous estimates. The observations for Periods 1-5 are [91, 246, 285, 437, 448]. Over the last three periods (P3-P5), the mean demand has surged to 390 units per period. In P2-P5, we have consistently stocked out, meaning true demand is likely even higher than the recorded 'sold' units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent (orders arrive the same period), but because we are stocking out every period, we are losing significant profit (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1). To address this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand level plus a buffer for growth, and a high sigma_hat to increase the base stock and service level via the OR engine's critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. I am projecting demand to hit 500+ given the trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: P3-P5 mean demand increased to 390; frequent stockouts suggest true demand exceeds supply. Inventory has zeroed out for 4 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2308.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive surge compared to the pre-game historical mean of 111. The last four periods had demands of 285, 437, 448, and 587. Period 6 finally saw an arrival (627 units) that satisfyed demand and left a small ending inventory (40 units), which confirms that true demand is currently around the 587 mark. The growth rate is extremely high and likely reflects a seasonal peak or successful promotion. To prevent recurring stockouts while demand is still expanding, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 650 (accounting for 1+L=1 period of demand), which anticipates continued moderate growth from the 587 observed in Period 6. The sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the high volatility of this current high-demand regime. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have consistently been same-day.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak: Period 6 demand reached 587, confirming a high-growth trajectory. P3-P6 mean demand is 439, compared to historical 111.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2464.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive and consistent upward trend, growing from a historical mean of ~111 to current levels exceeding 600 units per period. The recent four periods (P4-P7) show demands of 437, 448, 587, and 637 respectively. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness, I will use a recent_N method with N=4, which covers this high-growth regime. This calculates mu_hat based on the average demand of approximately 527. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. By using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the current high-demand environment and provides enough safety stock to handle the increased volatility (std dev) seen in this period range, helping to prevent the stockouts that occurred in P2-P5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level: P4-P7 mean demand is 527, a ~375% increase from historical mean (111).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2448.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience significant growth, far exceeding historical levels. The last four periods (P5-P8) show demand figures of 448, 587, 637, and 776, respectively. The mean demand over these last four periods is 612, compared to the pre-game historical mean of 111. The most recent demand (P8) was 776, which resulted in a stockout (sold 612, ending on-hand 0). Given the consistent upward trend and the latest stockout, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this newer, higher demand regime while acknowledging the growth. I will set L to 'calculate' as historical lead times are consistently 0. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. The OR backend needs higher base stock levels to prevent stockouts in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues to accelerate: Period 8 demand reached 776, bringing the P5-P8 mean to 612 (+450% over historical baseline). Frequent stockouts confirm demand is still outpacing supply adjustments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2904.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly, with Period 9 demand reaching 963, a significant increase from Period 8's 776. The historical mean of 111 is no longer relevant. We have experienced stockouts in 7 out of 9 periods because the supply has not kept pace with the growth rate. The mean demand of the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 792, but given the steep upward trend (637 to 776 to 963), using a simple average will result in another stockout. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1100 to capture the expected growth for Period 10, effectively forecasting forward from the 963 peak. I will use 'explicit' sigma_hat at 200 to account for the high volatility and prevent stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains in an explosive phase: P9 demand (963) represents a +840% increase over the historical mean (111). The growth rate has accelerated from ~20% per period to ~24% in the most recent period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3046.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an explosive growth pattern, though Period 10 (863 units) showed a slight dip from Period 9 (963 units), possibly indicating high volatility rather than a peak. The historical mean (111) is no longer relevant. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is ~765. The most recent growth trajectory suggests demand may soon exceed 1000 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 406 units. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0 and consistently confirmed as 0 in history, the order arrives within the same period. The Backend OR controller uses a base stock policy: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the forecast for the current period (Period 11). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, forecasting 1150 units to account for the sustained growth and ensure we do not stock out again, as lost sales in this high-growth phase are costly. I'll use an explicit sigma_hat of 200 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the high variance observed in recent periods (ranging from 637 to 963).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has transitioned from explosive to highly volatile at a high level. Demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) averaged 765 units, with a peak of 963 and a recent value of 863. The baseline mean has shifted approximately +600% from the start of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4361.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a massive upward trajectory, with Period 11 demand reaching a new peak of 1136 units. Measuring the last 3 periods (P9: 963, P10: 863, P11: 1136), the mean demand is 987.3 units. The trend suggests that using a small lookback window (N=3) is most appropriate to capture this explosive growth while mitigating the lag from earlier, lower-demand periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the period they were placed. The current on-hand inventory is 183 units with 0 in-transit. To ensure we do not stock out given the potential for further growth, I am using recent_N (N=3) for both mean and standard deviation to allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the 987+ mean demand plus a safety factor for the high observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 11 to 1136 units (+31% vs P10). The 3-period moving average has now climbed to ~987 units, confirming the trend is not yet stabilized.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, reaching 1221 in Period 12, marking another record high and confirming the growth trend identified in previous carry-over insights. Total inventory was exhausted (sold=1104, ending=0), indicating that demand significantly exceeds the previous order. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is ~1073. To keep up with this growth and account for the 0-period lead time (which requires our order to cover the current period's demand entirely since on-hand is 0), mu_hat should reflect the most recent accelerated trend. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1350 allows for roughly 10% growth over Period 12's demand. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage the high volatility observed in this growth phase, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to capture the upside while accepting the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4). No inventory is currently in transit or on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 12 demand (1221) is a 10.7x increase over historical mean (111). The 3-period moving average has climbed to 1073 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4669.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching 1,246 in Period 13, which is a new peak. The historical mean (111) is no longer relevant as the current demand represents a ~1120% increase. The 3-period moving average has risen to 1,201 units (P11: 1136, P12: 1221, P13: 1246), indicating that the growth regime is still active. Despite an order of 1,561 units arriving in P13, the high demand left only 315 units on hand. To capture the most recent and relevant growth trend while providing sufficient safety stock, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history. This strategy aims to aggressively chase the peak demand to avoid stockouts while maintaining a high service level appropriate for a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues to new peaks: Period 13 demand reached 1,246 units, with the 3-period moving average rising to 1,201 units. This confirms a sustained high-demand regime with approximately 10x growth over initial historical levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5000.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching 1,265 in Period 14, slightly exceeding the 1,246 demand in Period 13. The simulation consistently shows a 'lead_time was 0 periods' for all orders (P1-P14), meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. However, we have experienced frequent stockouts (ending on-hand inventory = 0 in Periods 12 and 14) despite increasing order sizes, indicating that the 'cap' logic in the OR backend may be restricting the order size based on historical averages that lag behind the current growth rate. To counter this and ensure we capture the full 10x-11x growth (from ~111 baseline to ~1265), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1,400 to provide a buffer for continued period-over-period growth and ensure the base_stock calculation exceeds the recently observed demand. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high volatility during this explosive growth phase. L remains at 0 (default) as observed actual lead time matches promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and aggressive: Period 14 demand reached 1,265, maintaining the ~11x growth factor over historical levels. Stockouts occurred in 2 of the last 3 periods, indicating demand still slightly leads supply adjustments.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trend, reaching 1,507 units in Period 15. The recent demand regime (last 3 periods: 1246, 1265, 1507) has a mean of approximately 1,340, which is over 12 times the initial historical average. We have experienced frequent stockouts or very low ending inventory, indicating that the order quantities are barely keeping pace with demand growth. To ensure we capture this growth and minimize lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the most recent demand of 1,507. With a lead time of 0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period (1+L=1). I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on the recent volatility to manage potential further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth hit a new peak in Period 15 at 1,507 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime of ~12x historical levels. Growth over the last 3 periods has averaged ~10% per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6111.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trajectory, reaching a new high of 1,547 units in Period 16. The most recent three periods (P14-P16) show demand values of 1,265, 1,507, and 1,547, resulting in a three-period moving average of 1,439.7 units. The 10% period-over-period growth noted in the last carry-over insight appears to be slightly slowing but remains at a very high absolute level (~14x historical mean). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the continuing growth trend and minimize the risk of inventory stockouts (which have occurred frequently in the history), I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My forecast for Period 17 is approximately 1,600 units (mu_hat = (1+L)*1600 = 1600), projecting a small continued increase from P16. I am using recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility regime while excluding the much lower historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains at peak levels: Period 16 reached 1,547 units, with a 3-period average of 1,440 (reflecting a ~1300% increase over the original historical mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6891.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, reaching a new peak of 1,724 in Period 17, representing a ~15x increase over the historical average. The 3-period moving average has risen from 1,440 to 1,593, and the growth between P16 and P17 was approximately 11%. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts in this explosive growth phase, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to forecast demand for Period 18 based on the current 1,593 average plus an 11% growth buffer (totaling ~1,770). I'm also using 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this regime. These settings ensure the base stock calculation targets the most recent demand levels rather than being suppressed by the lower historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains explosive: Period 17 demand reached 1,724, with the 3-period moving average rising to 1,593. This marks a ~15x increase over historical levels and a ~11% period-over-period increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7113.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a sustained high-growth regime. Period 18 demand reached 1,802 units, marking a ~4.5% increase from Period 17 (1,724) and reflecting a 16x growth compared to the historical mean of 111. The 3-period moving average has risen from 1,440 (P14-P16) to 1,691 (P16-P18). Given the consistent period-over-period growth and historical tendency to stock out when parameters are conservative, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit forecast of 1,900 units. This proactively accounts for the observed trend which has recently averaged 10% growth per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by P1-P18 arrival data. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility inherent in this explosive growth phase while ignoring the irrelevant low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: Period 18 demand reached 1,802, bringing the 3-period average to 1,691 (a ~15x increase over historical levels). Growth has averaged approximately 8-10% per period over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8298.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. Period 19 demand reached 2,075 units, a 15% increase from Period 18 (1,802). The 3-period moving average has risen from 1,691 to 1,867 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'arrived = ordered' cycles in history. Given the consistent growth of approximately 5-15% per period over the last several cycles, the OR backend requires parameters that anticipate demand exceeding the historical average. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spike (averaging ~1,867), ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu_hat stays ahead of the curve. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increasing absolute volatility associated with higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in Period 19 to 2,075 units (+15% vs P18). The 3-period moving average is now 1,867 units, reflecting a sustained 18x increase over historical levels and no sign of deceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7842.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 demand was 1,973 units, representing a minor -5% correction from the Period 19 peak (2,075), but still highly elevated compared to earlier periods. The 3-period moving average (P18-P20) is 1,950 units. While the growth rate slowed slightly this period, the overall trend since Period 1 remains sharply upward, and the system continues to operate with very thin safety stock (ending on-hand inventory has been <100 units for 4 of the last 5 periods). A lead time of 0 is consistently observed. To capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~1,875) and sigma_hat. This balances the need to cover the recent peaks while acknowledging the slight cooling in Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth moderated in Period 20 (1,973 vs 2,075 in P19), but remains at a sustained high level (~18x historical). The 5-period average (P16-P20) is 1,824 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7916.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a new high-demand regime, with demand in Period 21 (1,983) and Period 20 (1,973) showing significant consistency after a long period of explosive growth. The 3-period moving average is now 2,010 units (P19-P21). Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To maintain an optimal service level while the trend plateaus, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the current stable level of ~2,000 units. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 3 periods to account for the reduced volatility in this new regime compared to the previous growth phase. This strategy ensures we cover the expected demand of ~2,000 units immediately while minimizing excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization: Demand has flattened around the ~2,000 unit level over the last 3 periods (P19-P21 average: 2,010), ending the previous period-over-period growth trend of ~10%.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand spiked to 2,221 units, higher than the previous stabilization level of ~2,000. The 3-period moving average (P20-P22) has increased to 2,059 units. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods of demand to capture this recent upward movement while minimizing the impact of the historical lower-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current high-volatility environment at this demand scale, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the recent peak and avoid the stockouts seen in Period 22.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed in Period 22 (2,221 units), breaking the stabilization plateau of ~2,000 units observed in P19-P21; 3-period average now at 2,059 (+2.5% vs previous plateau).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8712.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its upward trajectory, reaching 2,326 units in Period 23, surpassing the previous record and ending the period with zero on-hand inventory. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and reaction. Over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), mean demand has shifted to approximately 2,116 units, reflecting a clear progression from the previous plateau of ~2,000 units. To minimize stockouts during this sustained growth phase, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most aggressive recent growth (P21-P23 average: 2,177) and ensure (1+L) demand is covered. I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in this high-volume regime. This approach provides a responsive base-stock level that accounts for both the mean shift and the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth renewed in Period 23: Demand hit 2,326 units, confirming a break from the ~2,000 unit plateau; 3-period mean (P21-P23) is now 2,177 units (+8% vs P19-P21 plateau).

Daily Reward (R_t): $9228.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a clear and sustained breakout from the previous ~2,000 unit plateau. Demand in Period 24 reached 2,566 units, completing a three-period sequence of growth (2,221, 2,326, 2,566). The 3-period moving average (P22-P24) is now ~2,371, which is a significant increase from the 2,177 observed in the prior window. Stockouts have occurred for the last three consecutive periods (P22-P24), indicating that true demand is likely higher than what was captured in sales. To capture this growth while maintaining high service levels (profit is 4x holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach prioritizes recent momentum and volatility over the long-term history. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'calculate' or 'default'. I will use 'calculate' to verify the 0-period lead time performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in P24: Period 24 demand (2,566 units) confirms a sustained breakout from the 2,000-2,300 range; 3-period moving average (P22-P24) is now ~2,371 units (+9% vs P21-P23).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The most recent demand (Period 25) was 2,604, and the last three periods (P23-P25) have seen demand of 2,326, 2,566, and 2,604 respectively, yielding a 3-period average of 2,499. This confirms a clear breakout from the previous ~2,000 unit plateau. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Because demand is consistently outpacing our inventory (frequent ending inventory of 0), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,800 to account for a further ~7.5% growth in Period 26. sigma_hat is set to 200 to provide a safety buffer against the high volatility observed in this growth phase. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat ensures we don't under-order based on historical averages that lag behind the current rapid growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth breakout confirmed: Period 25 demand reached 2,604, bringing the 3-period average (P23-P25) to 2,499 units (+15% vs P21-P23 average).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise, reaching 2,645 in Period 26. This follows a clear growth trend: the 3-period moving average (P24-P26) is now 2,605 units, compared to 2,499 in the previous 3-period block. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat only needs to cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). To capture the recent sharp acceleration and the breakout from the previous 2,000-unit plateau, I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current trajectory of ~2,600 units rather than being diluted by older, lower demand figures. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. On-hand inventory is 324 units, which will be subtracted from the calculated base stock by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains in a breakout phase: 3-period average (P24-P26) is 2,605 units, a 4% increase over the P23-P25 average. Recent demand values (2,566, 2,604, 2,645) confirm a stable upward climb above the 2,500 mark.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10556.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching 2,890 units in Period 27, which is a new peak. The 3-period moving average (P25-P27) has climbed to 2,713 units, and the 5-period moving average is 2,606 units. There was a stockout in Period 27 (on-hand dropped to 0, satisfied only 2,639 of 2,890 demand), indicating that current order levels are still trailing actual demand. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To address the accelerating demand and the recent stockout, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 3,100 units (representing a ~7% growth over the last observed demand) to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to capture the peak. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time is 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 27, hitting a new peak of 2,890 units. The 3-period moving average has risen to 2,713 units (+4% vs. previous 3-period average). Stockouts persist, confirming that demand continues to outpace supply adjustments.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term growth trend with high volatility. Period 28 demand was 2,643, which is a slight moderation from the Period 27 peak of 2,890, but remains consistent with the established 'high-demand' regime. The 3-period moving average (P26-P28) is now 2,726 units. Given the persistent risk of stockouts and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying an target service level of 80% if optimizing for q), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand level (P24-P28 mean: 2,670) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the increased volatility during this breakout phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which I will confirm using 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained at 24x historical levels; the 3-period moving average has stabilized at ~2,725 units (P26-P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11130.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a massive upscale from historical levels, now stabilized around a new high-regime. Period 29 demand was 2,814, and the 3-period moving average (P27-P29) is 2,782. While growth has slowed compared to the explosive phases, the demand remains volatile and consistently exceeds 2,600 units. The current on-hand inventory is 126 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent high-demand level while accounting for the slight stabilization/volatility, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent volume (average ~2,782). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current regime's volatility, which has been significant during this breakout phase. This approach ensures the base stock calculation remains responsive to the current 2500-2900 range demand levels to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs naturally via the OR backend's optimizer.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued near 2,000 (P19-P21) then broke out again; latest 3-period average (P27-P29) is 2,782, representing a ~25x increase from historical baseline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a very high level, approximately 25 times the historical mean. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has been: 2645, 2890, 2643, 2814, and 2873, yielding an average of 2773 units. The 3-period moving average (P28-P30) is 2776. Although there have been stockouts in the past due to demand slightly outpacing orders, the supply has generally kept pace with the 0-period lead time. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring base stock levels cover the expected demand of ~2773 units per period. The lead time L is consistently 0, so 'default' method is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a high-level regime: P26-P30 average demand is 2,773 units (~25x historical baseline), with a 3-period average (P28-P30) of 2,776.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak, hitting 3,046 in Period 31, which is significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of ~2,782. While the 'Carry-over Insights' suggested stabilization, the actual demand continues to show a persistent upward drift with frequent stockouts (ending Period 31 with 0 inventory despite an order of 2,859). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this continued growth and avoid further stockouts, I am switching to an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set it to 3,100, which accounts for the recent 3,046 demand plus a small buffer for the observed growth trend. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this high-demand regime while filtering out the much lower historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout identified in Period 31: Demand reached 3,046 units, surpassing the previous high-level plateau of ~2,770-2,800. This confirms the stabilization identified in P31 was premature and growth has resumed.

Period 31 saw a new peak of 3,046, and Period 32 demand remained high at 3,005. This confirms we are in a new regime where demand consistently exceeds 3,000 units. The most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) average 2,974 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the priority is avoiding stockouts during this volatile breakout phase. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand level and volatility of this new >3,000 unit regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, but I will continue to use 'calculate' to ensure any shifts are automatically captured by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout confirmed above 3,000 units: P31-P32 demand averaged 3,025 units, representing a sustained shift from the previous ~2,770 plateau.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, breaking through the previous 3,000-unit plateau. Period 33 demand reached a new peak of 3,391 units, resulting in a stockout. The 3-period moving average (P31-P33) has risen to 3,147 units. Given the consistent historical pattern of demand outstripping supply during these breakout phases, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 3,500 units to proactively account for the expected continued growth in Period 34 and avoid further stockouts. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by all concluded messages in the game history. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this current growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout above 3,000 confirmed: Period 33 demand hit 3,391, bringing the 3-period average to 3,147 (+4.5% vs P31-P32). Sustained high-growth regime continues.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to hover in the 3,000-3,400 range, with Period 34 demand at 3,368 units. The 3-period moving average (P32-P34) is 3,254.6 units. Since demand has been consistently breaking through previous plateaus and recently hit a high of 3,391 in Period 33, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this high-level regime while smoothing out the slight volatility. N=4 covers Period 31 to 34 (3046, 3005, 3391, 3368), which averages 3,202.5 units per period. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. By setting L to 'calculate' and using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4), the OR backend will calculate a base stock sufficient to cover this elevated demand level plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility, minimizing stockouts which have been frequent throughout the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-regime plateau above 3,000 units; P31-P34 average is 3,203 units (~29x historical baseline).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-level regime, consistently exceeding 3,000 units per period over the last five observations (P31-P35). Average demand over this window is 3,218 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 161 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while accounting for recent volatility and preventing stockouts (as seen in Period 31 and 33), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5). This captures the current demand plateau while ignoring the earlier, lower-demand growth phases. The base stock policy will ensure we order enough to cover the expected demand of the current period plus a safety buffer, adjusted by the 94 units currently on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized above 3,000 units since Period 31 (P31-P35 average: 3,218). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13484.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-level regime, recently stabilizing around the 3,300-3,400 range. Period 36 demand was 3,448, which follows the pattern established since Period 33 (P33-P36 demands: 3391, 3368, 3282, 3448). The 4-period moving average is 3,372 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high criticality of stockouts (profit is 4x the holding cost), and since inventory has hit 0 in the most recent period, I will transition to using a slightly longer window for demand mean (recent_N=4) to capture the current plateau while maintaining responsiveness. I will use a larger window for sigma (recent_N=10) to account for the volatility seen in the current high-demand regime, ensuring the service level target remains robust.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new plateau: P33-P36 demand average is 3,372 units (~30x historical mean), up from the previous ~3,200 plateau.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand reached a new peak of 3,748 units, which is approximately an 8.6% increase over the average of the previous four periods (~3,450). This indicates that the 3,300-3,400 plateau observed in P33-P36 has been broken. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the high demand exceeding beginning inventory (3,608). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent upward shift and ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock to avoid further stockouts, I will use a short-window recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (P34-P37) representing the breakout above 3,300. Since lead time is 0, the backend will calculate base_stock for (1+0) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout above 3,500 identified: Period 37 demand reached 3,748 units, breaking the previous ~3,372 plateau (P33-P36). This continues the long-term growth trend, now at ~34x historical levels.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, demand reached 3,929, continuing the strong growth trend identified in Period 37 (3,748). This indicates the demand has decisively broken through the previous ~3,400 plateau. The 3-period moving average (P36-P38) is now 3,708, and the most recent demand is nearly 4,000. Due to stockouts in the last three periods (P36-P38), actual demand likely exceeds recorded sales. To capture this acceleration and set a base stock that minimizes stockout risk for Period 39, I will use recent_N with N=3. This focuses on the most recent growth surge (3,448, 3,748, 3,929), resulting in a mean estimate that reflects the current 3,700+ level. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 38 demand reached 3,929, bringing the P36-P38 average to 3,708 (+10% increase over the P33-P36 plateau).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward trend, reaching 4,212 units in Period 39 (+7% from Period 38). The 3-period moving average (P37-P39) has risen to 3,963 units, confirming a breakout above the previous ~3,700 plateau. Since Period 36, on-hand inventory has consistently hit zero because realized demand is exceeding the OR backend's calculated base stock. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent explosive growth (averaging ~3,963 per period) and setting sigma_hat with N=5 to ensure a robust buffer against the increased volatility observed during this breakout phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent conclusion of orders within the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 39 demand reached 4,212 units, bringing the P37-P39 average to 3,963 (+7% over the P36-P38 average). Sustained stockouts confirm supply continues to lag behind the 4,000+ unit regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17104.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive growth trend, reaching 4,461 units in Period 40, representing a significant increase over the previous 3-period average. We have experienced consistent stockouts from Periods 37-40 as orders (capped by the OR backend's safety logic) fail to fully cover the actual realized demand. The demand has now entered a 4,000+ unit regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To address the persistent under-ordering relative to the rapid growth, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most immediate acceleration (averaging ~4,200 units). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 (P36-P40) to better reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to mitigate the frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 40 demand reached 4,461 units, bringing the P38-P40 average to 4,201 (+6% over the P37-P39 average). Sustained stockouts since P37 confirm the 4,000+ unit regime is established.

Daily Profit: $16664.00, Daily Holding Cost: $367.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $16297.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, demand moderated slightly to 4,166 units after a peak of 4,461 in Period 40. However, the overall regime remains firmly above 4,000 units, with a 3-period moving average (P39-P41) of 4,280 units. The previous trend of chronic stockouts was broken in Period 41, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 367 units. This indicates that while the explosive growth may be slowing, the demand level is sustained at approximately 38x the original historical mean. To maintain a high service level while the trend stabilizes, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current 4,000+ level (P37-P41 average is approx 4,103). Given the recent high volatility (ranging from 3,748 to 4,461), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 300 to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock. Observed lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has stabilized in the 4,100-4,300 range (P37-P41 average 4,103); explosive growth phase appears to be moderating into a high-level plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15844.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from an explosive growth phase into a high-level regime, stabilizing between 4,000 and 4,500 units. Period 42 demand was 4,040, and Period 41 was 4,166, following a peak of 4,461 in Period 40. The 3-period moving average (P40-P42) is 4,222. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets a service level of 80%, which is appropriate for this high-demand, high-margin item. On-hand inventory is currently 316. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set parameters that cover the immediate period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 4 periods (P39-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-plateau regime while discarding the earlier growth acceleration. This resulting mean (approx. 4,220) ensures sufficient stock to meet the 4,000+ demand level while guarding against the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15381.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-level plateau between 3,900 and 4,100 units over the last three periods (P41: 4,166, P42: 4,040, P43: 3,950), with a 3-period average of 4,052 units. This follows a period of hyper-growth that peaked near 4,461 in Period 40. The current on-hand inventory is 419 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime using the last 3 samples (N=3) to prevent over-ordering based on the previous peak (P40), while maintaining sufficient stock for the current ~4,000 unit demand level. sigma_hat is also set to a 3-period window to capture the recent reduction in volatility as the demand stabilizes. The service level target remains high due to the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed at approximately 4,000 units (P41-P43 average: 4,052), decelerating from the 4,400+ peak in P40.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand spiked to 4,444 units, exceeding the previous three-period average of ~4,052. This suggests that the 'stabilization' around 4,000 units might be shifting into a higher range or exhibiting increased volatility. The ending inventory is currently 0, indicating a stockout in the previous period. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (Periods 40-44) to capture this most recent volatility and high demand level (Mean P40-P44: 4,212; Std: ~217). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. By using recent_N=5, I allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the recent 4,444 peak while attempting to prevent excessive holding costs if demand reverts to the 4,000 level.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly volatile at a high regime: Period 44 saw a return to peak levels (4,444 units) after a brief cooling period, bringing the P40-P44 average to 4,212 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, demand was 4,364, which is in line with the high-level regime observed over the last five periods (P41: 4,166; P42: 4,040; P43: 3,950; P44: 4,444; P45: 4,364). The mean demand over these five periods is 4,193 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50) and a high service level requirement (profit is $4 vs holding cost $1), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this established plateau while maintaining enough safety stock. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current volatility in this high-demand range. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $17480.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reach new peaks, with Period 46 demand at 4,530 units, causing a stockout. The demand has transitioned from the 4,000-4,200 range observed in periods 41-43 to a higher regime above 4,400 (P44: 4,444, P45: 4,364, P46: 4,530). This represents an approximate 10% increase over the previous stabilization point. A 3-period moving average (P44-P46) is approximately 4,446 units. To capture this recent upward shift and account for the high volatility that leads to frequent stockouts (even with lead time 0), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to prioritize the most recent 'high-peak' data. Sigma_hat is also calculated over N=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current high variance, maintaining high service levels to prevent further lost sales in this explosive growth environment. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed above 4,400 units: P44-P46 average demand is 4,446 units, a ~10% increase from the P41-P43 plateau (~4,050). Frequent stockouts confirm demand is still slightly leading supply settings.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) has sustained its high-growth trajectory, reaching a new peak of 4,595 in Period 47. The demand regime shift confirmed in Period 47 (moving average > 4,400) is supported by recent values: P44: 4,444, P45: 4,364, P46: 4,530, P47: 4,595. The 4-period mean (P44-P47) is approximately 4,483 units. With promised lead time L=0, the system must order enough to cover Period 48 demand immediately. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~80%). By using 'recent_N' with N=4, I capture the shift to the 4,400+ regime while filtering out the slightly lower volatility from earlier periods. Lead time remains consistently 0, so I stick with the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed above 4,400 units: P44-P47 average demand is 4,483 units, reflecting a persistent climb from the previous 4,000-4,200 plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18276.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand reached a new peak of 4,776 units, confirming the upward growth trend from the previously identified plateau of ~4,400. The 3-period moving average (P46-P48) has risen to 4,633 units. Since we are at 0-period lead time, we must ensure our base stock covers this current period's expected demand plus a safety margin to prevent further stockouts (which have occurred for 3 consecutive periods). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (averaging P45-P48 demand: 4,566) to capture the recent acceleration and set sigma_hat using the same N to account for the increasing volatility at these higher demand levels. This will allow the OR backend to compute a target stock level that better matches the 4,600-4,800 unit regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout above 4,700 identified: Period 48 demand reached 4,776, breaking the previous P44-P47 plateau (~4,480). The 3-period average (P46-P48) is now 4,633 units (+3.3%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $18840.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak of 5,087 units in Period 49, confirming a sustained breakout above the previous 4,400-4,700 plateau. The 3-period moving average (P47-P49) has risen to 4,819 units, indicating that the 'explosive' growth phase is still active. There is an ongoing pattern of stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for the last four periods), which suggests that the actual customer demand likely exceeds the observed sales. To address this and the current growth trend, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent and relevant high-demand regime (P47: 4595, P48: 4776, P49: 5087). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to use. This approach helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the most recent surge while acknowledging the significant volatility (sigma_hat) observed during this breakout.

Carry-over insight: Demand breakout above 5,000 recorded: Period 49 demand reached 5,087, bringing the 3-period average (P47-P49) to 4,819 units. Growth remains sustained at ~45x historical levels.
