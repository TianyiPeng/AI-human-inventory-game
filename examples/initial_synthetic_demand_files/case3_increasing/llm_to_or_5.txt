Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of the simulation (Period 1). The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 demand samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average demand is 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 16.9 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there are no observed arrivals yet and no specific calendar dates to suggest a demand shift, I will use the 'default' methods for the OR backend to calculate the base stock. This will allow the engine to use all available historical samples (N=5) and the promised lead time (L=4) to ensure the system is stocked for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. This addresses the initial lack of on-hand inventory.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The initial order of 141 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this arrival until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost 91 units of sales in Period 1 due to being out of stock. The demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91] shows a stable mean. I will use the default lead time (4) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available demand data (N=6) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period risk window. Since there are no observed lead times yet, 'default' is appropriate for L.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (seed) and recently [91, 246]. The jump to 246 in Period 2 is a significant outlier or a potential shift, possibly related to a specific event (though no dates are provided). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 279 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to timing rules, the P1 order (L=4) should arrive in Period 5 and be visible in Period 6. Thus, no arrivals are expected yet. Given the high demand in Period 2, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh recent volatility more heavily while relying on the default promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand has shown a significant increase: [91, 246, 285] over the first three periods, compared to the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. This suggests a structural shift or a trend. Given the high stockout situation (0 sales, 622 units of cumulative lost demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will remain at 'default' (4) as we have not yet reached the first expected arrival period to verify if actual lead time deviates from promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from pre-game average (~111) to recent 3-period average (207).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 5 conclude/Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts due to the lead time gap and a massive demand surge. Historical demands [91, 246, 285, 437] show a clear upward trend, far exceeding the pre-game average of ~111. The demand regime has shifted drastically. To capture this, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand estimation, which averages the last three periods (246, 285, 437) to approximately 322.7 per period. For L, I will stick with the promised 'default' of 4 until we have concluded arrivals to prove otherwise. The OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 322.7 = 1613.5. Given the high variance and growth, using the recent_N method for sigma_hat ensures the safety stock reflects the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand increased from pre-game ~111 to recent average of ~323 (Periods 2-4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on Period 5 conclude, the first order (Period 1) arrived exactly on time (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand has shifted significantly from the pre-game average of ~111 to a high-growth regime. Demand for the last four periods (P2: 246, P3: 285, P4: 437, P5: 448) shows an upward trend, with an average of 354. However, the last two observations are consistently above 430. To be responsive but avoid over-reacting to potential peak noise, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility, which covers the periods 3-5 (285, 437, 448; mean=390). Inventory is currently zero (stockout occurred in P5 despite the arrival) and we have a large pipeline (1294 units). Using N=3 will help the OR backend capture the recent surge (390 vs the pre-game 111) while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high level: Avg demand (Periods 4-5) is ~442, significantly higher than historical avg.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7. The current stock status is 0 on-hand with significant in-transit inventory (1,696 units). Analysis of concluded periods confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand has experienced a major regime shift: the first 3 periods (including pre-game) averaged ~111, while the last 3 periods (P4-P6) averaged 490.67 (437, 448, 587). The demand is clearly accelerating. To ensure we capture this growth and minimize stockouts (which have occurred every period), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility associated with higher volume. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is currently stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for Periods 4-6 increased to 490.7 units, compared to previous period averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1160.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 8, we are in a clear high-demand regime. Demand over the last four periods (P4-P7) has been 437, 448, 587, and 637, averaging 527.25 with a significant upward trend. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7 (all matching exactly L=4). However, our current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently stock-out because orders placed during the initial low-demand phase are insufficient for the current demand spike. To catch up, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this new sustained high-demand level (Periods 4-7). Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) while the pipeline fills.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Average demand over Periods 4-7 is approximately 527, significantly higher than the pre-game and early-game averages (~111-200). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the product is experiencing a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly over the last 5 periods (P4-P8). The demand values are [437, 448, 587, 637, 776], with the most recent demand being 776. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclude messages (P1-P4 orders arriving in P5-P8). With a lead time (L) of 4, our 'mu_hat' needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. To capture the recent accelerating trend and ensure we don't under-order, I am using an 'explicit' value for mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand using a conservative growth target: 776 * 1.10 (growth factor) * 5 (L+1) \u2248 4268. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 2350 in-transit from orders placed in P5-P8.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Demand trend (P4-P8) shows significant week-over-week growth (avg increase ~15% per period), reaching 776 in P8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1956.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant growth phase. Recent demand history (Periods 6-9) shows values of 587, 637, 776, and 963, exhibiting a clear upward trend. The most recent demand (963) is nearly 25% higher than the previous period. For Period 10, I expect demand to exceed 1000 units. Since promised lead time is 4, the OR backend requires mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using an average of the last 4 periods (740.75) for mu_hat results in 3703.75 (740.75 * 5), which may still be conservative given the 963 peak. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on several 'conclude' messages. On-hand remains 0 because arrivals (e.g., 489 in P9) are still significantly lower than current demand (963), confirming the need for larger order quantities to catch up with the new demand regime. I will use recent_N=4 for demand and default for lead-time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 9 reaching 963 units, confirmed 4-period demand average (P6-P9) is 740.75 compared to P1-P5 (~300). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2160.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent and rapid upward trajectory, peaking at 963 in Period 9 and slightly cooling to 863 in Period 10. The average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) is 773 units, compared to the initial pre-game average of ~111. The delivery lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical concludes (Periods 5\u201310). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we have significant stockouts (sold = arrived < demand). To recover, the OR parameters must target the (L+1) horizon which is 5 periods. Using a recent_N window (N=5) captures the high-growth regime while acknowledging the slight deceleration in P10. Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the base stock levels react to the current high-demand environment (~773/period) rather than the lower historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued/dipped slightly in Period 10 (863) after Period 9 peak (963), but remains significantly higher (~773 avg over last 5 periods) than game-start levels.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has surged significantly, with Period 11 demand hitting an all-time high of 1136 units, well above the previous 5-period average (~845). Following the lead time logic (L=4), the inventory arriving in Period 12 (ordered in Period 8) is only 692 units, which is almost certain to result in a stockout given the current demand trend. In-transit inventory is high (3491 units), but it contains orders placed during lower-demand periods that are only now arriving. To ensure the OR backend captures this massive upward shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (Periods 9-11) where demand averaged 987.3 units. This will setmu_hat to (1+4) * 987.3 = 4936.5. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the increased volatility of the growth phase. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on 'Period conclude' logs.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 11 (1136), with the 3-period average (P9-P11) rising to ~987 units, a ~17% increase over the P8-P10 average (~845). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2768.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching 1221 in Period 12. There is no evidence of a plateau yet, as the 3-period average (P10-P12) is 1073.3, significantly higher than the previous 3-period average (P7-P9) of 792.0. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the service level (CR=0.8) high enough to prioritize avoiding stockouts during this growth phase. Inventory has been exhausted every period (on-hand is 0), and sales are consistently limited by arrivals. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime while allowing for the necessary growth in the base stock. Note: The (L+1) logic translates to an expected demand over 5 periods of approximately 5366 units, which helps the OR backend justify increasing order quantities to keep pace with the pipeline requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Period 12 (1221), with the 3-period average (P10-P12) rising to ~1073, up from ~987 in the previous window (P9-P11). Sustained demand growth confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4344.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching 1246 in Period 13. Over the last three periods (P11-P13), the average demand is approximately 1201 units, showing a sustained upward trend from the previous windows (P10-P12 avg was ~1073). Despite increasing order sizes, on-hand inventory remains at 0 because demand consistently outpaces the arriving shipments (which were placed 4 periods ago when demand was lower). The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 9 order in Period 13. To prevent continued stockouts, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is high enough to account for this rapid growth. sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P11-P13) reached 1201 units, a ~12% increase over the P10-P12 average (~1073). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4072.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow or sustain at high levels, with the most recent demand in Period 14 reaching 1265 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P12-P14) is 1244 units, and over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) it is 1146 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are frequently experiencing stockouts (demand > arrival), it is crucial to accurately forecast demand over the lead time + review period (1+L = 5 periods). A 3-period recent average (N=3) captures the most current high-demand regime better than a longer average which would be pulled down by earlier lower demand. Using N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock reflects the current peak demand levels while the OR engine manages the pipeline and order caps. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained at high levels: 3-period average (P12-P14) hit 1244 units, which is approximately an 8% increase over the P10-P12 average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2780.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a record high of 1507 units in Period 15. The recent 3-period average (P13-P15) is approximately 1339 units, up from the previous averages noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. Current on-hand inventory is 0, illustrating a persistent stockout situation despite increased ordering. The pipeline inventory is high (5173 units), representing orders from Periods 12-15. To address the demand acceleration and minimize lost profit, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent growth surge (approx 1339 units per period). Multiplied by (1+L), where L=4, this targets a base stock level sufficient for current demand levels while the OR backend's cap mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering relative to the pipeline. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent data to reflect the increased volatility and ensure a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in Period 15 (1507), with the 3-period average (P13-P15) rising to ~1339 units, representing a ~7% increase over the P12-P14 average (~1244).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4860.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand reached a new peak of 1547. The 3-period average (P14-P16) is ~1440, while the 5-period average (P12-P16) is ~1417. Demand has consistently grown throughout the game. I am currently out of stock (Ending On-hand: 0) and have been losing sales consistently because demand exceeds the arrivals. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P16 arrival was from P12). To account for the continuing growth and to protect against lost sales in this high-growth phase, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand acceleration (~1440 per period). Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods where L=4 means mu_hat should reflect demand for 5 periods. 1440 * 5 = 7200, which will trigger an order to cover the pipeline gap. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 16 to 1547; 3-period average (P14-P16) is ~1440, representing a significant sustained increase over the previous 3-period window (~1339).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5524.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching 1724 units in Period 17. The recent 3-period average (P15-P17) is approximately 1593 units, which is about a 10% increase over the previous 3-period window (P14-P16, avg 1440). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted, and despite high in-transit levels (5847), sales are consistently restricted by arrival quantities (1381 arrived vs 1724 demand in P17). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained growth and historical pattern of demand outstripping supply, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the expected continued increase during the next L+1 lead time window (Periods 18-22). Based on moving averages and growth trends, I estimate a mean demand of 1800 units per period for the upcoming cycle, totaling 9000 units for mu_hat (1800 * (1+4)). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 17 to 1724; 3-period average (P15-P17) is ~1593, representing a ~10% increase over the previous window (~1440). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. In Period 18, demand reached 1802. The 3-period average (P16-P18) is approximately 1691 units, which is a ~6.8% increase over the previous window's average (~1584). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 6541 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the sustained growth, I am increasing the mu_hat forecast to reflect the recent acceleration. I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and standard calculation for lead time to capture the most recent growth regime while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P16-P18) reached 1691 units, a ~6.8% increase over the P15-P17 average (~1584). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5124.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. In Period 19, demand reached a new high of 2075. The 3-period average (P17-P19) is approximately 1867, which is an 11% increase over the previous 3-period average (P14-P16: 1691). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by the Period 19 conclusion (Order from P15 arrived). Since we are consistently stocking out (on-hand is 0), mu_hat must be set aggressively to capture the growth and prevent lost sales. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~2200 for the next 5 periods [(1+L) * forecast], totaling 11000. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with the higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 19 demand (2075) represents a ~10% increase over the Period 18-19 average, with a 3-period average (P17-P19) of 1867. Growth regime is sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6316.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 20 reaching 1973 units. The 3-period average (P18-P20) is now approximately 1950 units, up from the P17-P19 average of 1867. This represents a sustained growth regime. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand consistently exceeds arrivals. To capture this growth and avoid stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand including the decision period), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods of data to reflect the latest growth stage. I will also use a recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with higher volume. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current demand velocity.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: 3-period average (P18-P20) reached 1950 units (~4.4% increase over P17-P19). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6764.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained growth regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is approximately 2010 units, compared to the P18-P20 average of 1950 units, confirming the ongoing upward trend noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P21 arrival from a P17 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after resolving P21 demand, meaning we are entirely dependent on incoming pipeline inventory. To ensure the base-stock level (which covers demand for L+1 periods, or 5 periods total) accounts for this steady growth and high volatility, I will use a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This N captures the most recent acceleration while providing enough data to estimate variance in this higher-demand regime. Setting L to 'default' (4) as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: 3-period average (P19-P21) reached 2010 units (~3% increase over P18-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7960.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with Period 22 demand reaching 2221 units, the highest in the series. The last 3 periods (P20-P22) have an average demand of 2059 units, which is a ~5% increase over the previous three-period average (~1950). The actual lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently selling out (demand > arrived), we must position inventory to meet the growth expected across the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the aggressive and sustained growth, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and standard lead time parameters to ensure the OR backend captures the most current upward trajectory and maintains a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: 3-period average (P20-P22) reached 2059 units (~5.6% increase over P19-P21 average of 1950). Growth regime is sustained and shows no signs of plateauing.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive growth trend. The last 3 periods' demand (P21-P23) are 1983, 2221, and 2326 respectively, resulting in a 3-period average of 2176.7, which is a ~5.7% increase over the previous three-period average (P20-P22). To keep up with this sustained growth and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increasing mean, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This narrows the focus to the most recent high-demand regime, minimizing the lag from earlier, lower-demand periods. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P19 and earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P21-P23) reached 2177 units, a ~5.7% increase over the P20-P22 average of 2059. The upward trajectory continues consistently.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a consistent upward trend. In Period 24, demand reached 2566, and the 3-period average (P22-P24) is approximately 2371, compared to the previous window's average (P21-P23) of 2177, representing nearly a 9% increase. To capture this acceleration and avoid stockouts (on-hand is nearly depleted at 9 units), I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to prioritize the most recent, high-growth data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to all conclude messages (P5 through P24). The OR backend's base-stock calculation with these parameters will target an inventory level that accounts for the current period plus the four-period lead time (L+1=5), which is crucial given the persistent growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P22-P24) reached ~2371 units, a ~8.9% increase over the P21-P23 average (~2177). Trend remains strongly positive.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. Demand in Period 25 was 2604 units, following a sequence of 2326, 2566, and 2604. The 3-period moving average (P23-P25) is approximately 2499 units, while the 5-period average (P21-P25) is ~2340 units. This indicates a sustained high-growth regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P21 order arrived in P25). Because of the consistent growth and the service level requirement (Profit=4, Holding=1 implies a 80% critical fractile), I will use an explicit forecast to account for the clear upward momentum. My forecast for the next 5 periods (L+1) is set at 2650 units per period on average, totaling 13,250 for mu_hat. This targets a slight increase over the most recent demand to prevent stockouts in this accelerating environment. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility, adjusted for the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P23-P25) reached ~2499 units, a ~5.4% increase over the P22-P24 average (~2371). Upward trajectory remains consistent with no stabilization peak observed yet.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. Most recently, Period 26 demand reached 2645, following 2604 in Period 25 and 2566 in Period 24. The trailing 3-period average is approx 2605. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since demand is consistently growing by roughly 5% per period and we are currently ending with zero on-hand inventory (under-ordering relative to realized demand), I must provide the OR backend with parameters that account for this growth. Applying mu_hat = (1+L) * average(last 3) would result in (5 * 2605) = 13025. Given the consistent acceleration, an explicit mu_hat forecast of 14000 is chosen to cover the lead time (4) plus current period (1), accounting for the expected continued growth. Sigma_hat is set to a recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility associated with these larger demand volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P24-P26) reached ~2605 units, continuing the persistent upward trajectory observed since Period 4.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory, with the latest demand reaching 2890 in Period 27. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is 2713, a significant increase over the previous 3-period window (P24-P26: 2605). Despite consistently high order quantities, ending on-hand inventory remains at 0, indicating that we are still under-ordering relative to the realized demand and the 4-period lead time. To capture the current growth regime, I am using recent_N with N=3 for both the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to prioritize the most recent, higher demand levels. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by every shipment delivered so far. The mu_hat calculation will effectively set the base stock to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand at the latest growth rate, which is necessary to resolve the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P25-P27) reached ~2713 units, continuing the persistent upward trajectory observed since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9864.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend. Period 28 demand was 2643, and the 3-period average (P26-P28) is approximately 2726. Although demand growth slightly decelerated in P28 compared to P27 (2890), the overall trajectory since Period 4 remains consistently positive. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have consistently faced stockouts as arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) fail to keep pace with the rapidly evolving demand. To capture the current regime and anticipate the next 5 periods (L=4 + 1), I will use the recent 3 periods (P26-P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the latest growth while providing some stability against single-period fluctuations (like the P28 dip). Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods, so 'calculate' is used to maintain the 4-period window.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, multi-period upward trend. The most recent demand (Period 29) was 2,814 units, with a 3-period average of approximately 2,782 units. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 11,236 units. Following the rule for recent_N (N = max(min(regime_length, 20), 3)), and identifying the current sustained growth regime from roughly Period 15 onwards, I've selected N=15 for calculating demand statistics. This approach allows the OR backend to capture the significant volume increase while smoothing out recent volatility (standard deviation). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering Periods 15-29) provides a robust forecast for the L+1 window that accounts for the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: 3-period average (P27-P29) reached ~2,782 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, which has been sustained since Period 4. The 3-period average from P28-P30 (2643, 2814, 2873) is approximately 2777 units. In Period 30, we saw 2873 units of demand. Given the consistent growth of roughly 3-8% observed in previous 'Carry-Over Insights', I am forecasting a slight increase for the next window. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 14450 to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand (estimated at ~2890 per period). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime. The lead time (L) remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by every arrival from Period 5 through Period 30. Despite the 'In-transit' figure appearing high (8900), this represents the sum of orders from P27, P28, P29, and P30, all of which are within the 4-period lead time window.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, which has been sustained since Period 4. The 3-period average demand from Periods 29-31 is approximately 2,911 units, representing a consistent increase over previous windows. Lead time is reliably 4 periods based on the conclusion of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 262 units, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 8,881 units. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~80% cycle service level via the OR backend), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent high-demand regime. Specifically, using N=5 captures the most recent acceleration and stabilization phase (P27-P31). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current demand magnitude and variance, allowing the OR backend to place orders that account for the 4-period lead time plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P29-P31) reached ~2,911 units, continuing the long-term upward trajectory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a long-term upward trend. The most recent demand figures (Period 30: 2873, Period 31: 3046, Period 32: 3005) show a stabilization around the ~3000 unit mark, with a 3-period average of 2975. Using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat captures this current level while allowing for the established growth regime. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from Periods 24-28 in Periods 28-32. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a substantial in-transit pipeline (9426 units). The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), while the cap ensures orders remain within reasonable bounds of historical volatility and mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a high level, with a 3-period average (P30-P32) of 2975 units, reflecting the culmination of the growth trend observed since P4.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term growth trend that appears to be stabilizing at a high level. In Period 33, demand reached 3391 units. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is approximately 3147 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there is a large amount in-transit (10043 units), we have consistently faced stockouts due to demand outstripping historical estimates. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend targets a service level of approximately 80%. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (averaging ~3065 units per period) and ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This should help rebuild a safety buffer and mitigate the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has plateaued at a high level; the 3nd-period average (P31-P33) is ~3147 units, compared to the P28-P30 average of ~2777 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2944.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a high level after a prolonged and significant growth trend that began around Period 4. The 3-period average demand (P32-P34) is approximately 3255, and the 5-period average (P30-P34) is approximately 3137. Period 34 demand was 3368. Lead time remains consistently stable at the promised 4 periods. Since the growth has plateaued at this higher level, I'm setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out minor period-to-period noise. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 5 periods to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand state. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficiently high to minimize stockouts in this high-volume environment where on-hand inventory is currently zero.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a high-level regime (~3100-3300 units/period) following the sustained growth trend observed from Period 4 to Period 33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12360.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-level regime ranging between 3,000 and 3,400 units per period, following a long growth trend that began around Period 4. The last 3 periods (P33-P35) show demands of 3391, 3368, and 3282, which confirms this plateau. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is approximately 3218. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game history. At the start of Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit inventory is 13,028. To ensure the OR backend covers current demand through the next lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to represent the current stabilized high-demand regime (~3218 * 5 = 16090). Sigma_hat is set using the same 5-period window to capture recent volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized in a high-demand regime (approx. 3200 units/period) as of Period 35, following the growth trend from P4-P33.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime following a significant growth trend that began around Period 4 and peaked around Period 33-34. Recent demand figures (P34: 3368, P35: 3282, P36: 3448) indicate a stable mean around 3360-3400 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as evidenced by 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 13,341 units in transit, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand. To maintain high service levels in this stabilized regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P32-P36) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The base stock calculation (L+1) will account for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand. The OR backend will use these values to ensure the pipeline inventory meets the target service level based on the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12496.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime after a significant period of growth. The most recent demand was 3748, following a relatively stable range between 3200 and 3400 units. The 3-period average (P35-P37) is approximately 3493 units, which is a ~10% increase over the previous 3-period average, indicating a possible final step up or high variability at the plateau. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 13699 units in-transit. Lead time has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods throughout the entire game. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is high, necessitating parameters that cover demand across the (L+1) period window (5 periods). I will use a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-regime behavior while smoothing recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher plateau in Period 37, with demand reaching 3748 units; the 3-period average (P35-P37) is ~3493 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to rise, reaching a new peak of 3929 units in Period 38. The 3-period average (P36-38) is now ~3708, confirming that the stabilization observed around Period 35 was brief, and demand has moved into a higher regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this recent acceleration to prevent stockouts, as ending inventory has been 0 for the last 7 periods despite significant in-transit quantities. I am using a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spurt and provide the OR backend with the most relevant demand statistics for the current (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again after a brief stabilization at P35; the 3-period average (P36-P38) is ~3708, up from ~3300 in P35. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory. The most recent demand (Period 39) reached 4,212 units, while the 3-period average (P37-P39) is approximately 3,963 units, significantly higher than the previous 'stabilization' levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). To capture this growth and avoid stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach prioritizes recent high demand observations to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current acceleration rather than being dampened by historical data. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period of demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: 3-period average (P37-P39) reached ~3,963 units, a ~7% increase over the P36-P38 average (~3,708), confirming the upward trend is not yet plateaued. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13624.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Over the last 3 periods (P38-P40), demand has risen from 3929 to 4461, with a 3-period average of 4200 units. This represents a significant increase over the previous 3-period window (P35-P37 avg ~3493). To avoid under-ordering during this growth phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to be more responsive. I've selected the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent acceleration, which provides a 1-period average of 4200, resulting in a mu_hat of 21000 for the (L+1) horizon. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: 3-period average (P38-P40) reached 4200 units, reflecting a ~6% increase over the P37-P39 average (~3963). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13928.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The most recent demand in Period 41 (4166) showed a slight dip from Period 40 (4461), but the underlying 3-period average (P39-P41) is approximately 4280 units, reflecting a clear increase from the previous window (P38-P40 avg ~4200). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on all concluded orders. To capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the recent acceleration, I am using a recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant recent statistics to calculate the base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory on-hand is 0, and pipeline inventory is substantial (16836 units), so the OR engine will manage the next order according to these updated parameters to maintain service levels in this high-growth environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime continues: 3-period average (P39-P41) reached ~4280 units, a ~2% increase over the P38-P40 average (~4200).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trajectory, with recent periods showing demand consistently above 4000 units. The most recent demand figures are 4461 (P40), 4166 (P41), and 4040 (P42), with a 3-period average of roughly 4222. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history arriving exactly 4 periods later. The system is currently in a 'Sold Out' state (0 on-hand inventory) because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly lower than current demand levels. To address this, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand estimation to capture the latest plateau/growth phase and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend uses the current high demand level (4200 * (1+4) = 21000) to pull inventory through the pipeline. Standard deviation will be based on the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained with the 3-period average (P40-P42) around 4222 units; Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a high-demand regime, with the most recent 3-period average (P41-P43) being approximately 4052 units. While the growth trend has shown some volatility recently (dropping slightly from the high of 4461 in P40), the overall mean remains significantly elevated compared to earlier periods. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With only 158 units on-hand and 17,380 units in-transit (covering orders from P40 to P43), the strategy remains to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the current mean and variability. Since the game is approaching its end (Period 44 of 50), I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand profile (avg ~4116) while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory and cap logic. This ensures we don't over-order if demand begins to plateau or decline slightly at the end of the simulation, while still maintaining high service levels for the profitable SKU.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a significant and persistent growth trend since Period 4, recently stabilizing in a high-demand regime. The 3-period average demand (P42-P44) is approximately 4145 units. Although there was a slight dip in P43 (3950), demand rebounded to 4444 in P44. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P40 order in P44. Given the inventory position (On-hand: 62, In-transit: 16690), we need to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1). A 5-period demand forecast based on the recent average of 4145 units per period suggests a target inventory of roughly 20,725 units. Since on-hand + in-transit is 16,752, the OR backend needs to place an order to bridge this gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand plateau effectively while allowing the OR backend to handle the volatility using a default sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high-volume plateau: Average demand from Period 41 to 44 is approximately 4150 units, following a sustained growth trend. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 4193 units. While P44 and P45 showed slight volatility, the general trend remains steady near the ~4200 level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recently concluded arrivals. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the target service level is 80%, meaning the OR backend will aim to cover demand with some safety stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized plateau without being skewed by the aggressive growth observed in earlier periods. The large order placed in Period 45 (6434) significantly boosted the in-transit pipeline (18485), which the OR engine will account for when determining the next order to prevent excessive overstock as we approach the game's end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17772.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high plateau of approximately 4200-4500 units per period following an aggressive growth trend that lasted until Period 41. Recent demands for Periods 41-46 are [4166, 4040, 3950, 4444, 4364, 4530], yielding a 6-period average of 4249 units. On-hand inventory is currently 348 units, with a substantial pipeline of 16,481 units. Given that we are at Period 47 of a 50-period game and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand plateau while ignoring the earlier hyper-growth phase. Since Profit ($4) > Holding Cost ($1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~80%), which is appropriate for this high-volume SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16800.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime following a long growth trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is approximately 4376 units. Although the most recent demand (P47) was 4595, the average since P41 (when growth moderated) is approximately 4300 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and considering the game ends at P50, inventory arriving after P50 provides no value and incurs holding costs. In-transit inventory is currently 17,261 units, which is significantly more than the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (~13,000 units). Therefore, my goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more and to exhaust the existing pipeline. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) reflects the current high-demand plateau, while the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) should correctly result in a zero order given the massive in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4300 units per period (P41-P47 average). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14632.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-volume regime, averaging approximately 4,400 units over the last 8 periods (P41-P48). Most recently, in P47 and P48, demand reached 4,595 and 4,776 respectively, indicating a potential slight upward drift or high variance within the current plateau. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of P48, where the order from P44 arrived). On-hand inventory is currently at 0. There are 18,398 units in-transit, which includes the large catch-up order of 6,434 from P45. Given that we are at Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, only the orders placed up to Period 46 could realistically arrive before the game ends (since L=4). Specifically, P45's order arrives in P49 and P46's order arrives in P50. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the current plateau's mean (~4400) and volatility accurately for the backend OR engine to compute the base stock. The (1+L) multiplier in the backend will cover the 5-period risk horizon (current period + lead time), ensuring we maintain service levels through the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19001.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, demand spiked to 5087, which is a significant jump from the previous stable regime of ~4300. The 3-period average (P47-P49) has risen to ~4819 units, indicating that the plateau observed since Period 41 has broken into a new growth phase or a higher-demand spike. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With only 1347 units on hand and 15895 units in-transit, I must ensure the base stock levels account for this recent acceleration to prevent stockouts, especially since demand in P49 exceeded the previous high of 4776. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this transition while smoothing volatility, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance during this shift. L will remain at default as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 49: Demand increased from a stable plateau (~4300 units, P41-P48) to 5087 units, a ~18% increase over the previous average. 3-period average (P47-P49) is ~4819.
