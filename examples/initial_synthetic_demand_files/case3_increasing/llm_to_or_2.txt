Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance or lead time data yet; however, we have 5 past demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average demand is 111.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.1. Since the promised lead time is 4, we must account for 5 periods (L+1) of demand coverage. Total expected demand for 5 periods is 557 units. I will use the 'default' methods which will utilize all available demand data to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and the promised lead time of 4 for L. This provides a balanced initial inventory position to meet demand while accounting for the lead time delay.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As Period 2 begins, we see demand for Period 1 was 91, which resulted in 91 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Current on-hand remains 0, and the initial order is in-transit. Since we only have 6 demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91] and no concluded lead times yet, the 'default' or 'recent_N' methods are most appropriate. The demand appears relatively stable (mean ~108). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the promised lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), I will use 'recent_5' to capture the most recent demand trend while excluding the earliest historical sample. L is set to 'default' as we have no evidence yet that the lead time differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5, meaning it will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). The same applies to the order from Period 2 arriving in Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 281 units in-transit (141 from P1 + 140 from P2). Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 2 (246) compared to the initial past data (mean ~111) and Period 1 (91). However, with only two periods of live data, it's too early to confirm a sustained regime shift, though the Period 2 demand suggests high volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 5 past demand samples) to better capture recent behavior while smoothing the P2 spike. L remains 'default' (4) as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 91, Period 2 was 246, and Period 3 was 285. The initial 'Past demands' provided were [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. There is a clear and significant jump in demand starting at Period 2 (shifting from ~110 avg to ~260+ avg). Since promised lead time is 4, we have not seen any arrivals yet (expected arrival for P1 order is Period 5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales. To address the demand shift, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat tracking the last 3 periods (P1-P3) to capture the higher volume while still acknowledging the initial baseline. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean(recent_N). With L=4, target coverage is (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Existing pipeline inventory (523 units) covers roughly 2 periods of the new demand level, so the OR backend will likely place a large order to bridge the gap to the 5-period target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 2: Average demand increased from ~110 to ~265 (+140%).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) are expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5. Since arrivals happen AFTER our decision phase, we should expect to see the first delivery confirmation in the Period 5 conclude message (available at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 900 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). Demand has shown a significant upward trend: 91, 246, 285, 437. The Carry-over insight correctly identified a regime shift starting at Period 2. The most recent demand (437) suggests the shift might be even more aggressive than a simple step change. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the higher demand periods (P2, P3, P4) more heavily while we wait for the first arrival to confirm the supply chain cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration observed: Demand grew for 3 consecutive periods (246 -> 285 -> 437), indicating a potential peak or strong growth trend beyond the initial regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the last 4 periods shows a sharp upward trend (246, 285, 437, 448). The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~390. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and Period 5's arrival confirms a 4-period lead time. However, due to the high demand growth, we have significant backlogs (sold < demand in prior periods) and on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts, mu_hat needs to reflect the high-regime demand across the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use the last 3 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3rd consecutive period with demand > 400 (P4: 437, P5: 448). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a strong upward demand trend. Historical demand has sequence: 91, 246, 285, 437, 448, 587. The last three periods show demand consistently above 400, specifically averaging 490.6 over the last three periods. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (arrived Period 5 for Period 1 order, Period 6 for Period 2 order). On-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing lost sales because arrivals are smaller than current demand due to the rapid growth. To prevent stockouts and cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods), we need to set mu_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime. Using N=3 for recent demand captures the average of 490.6 per period. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility of the current growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Last 3 periods (P4-P6) average 490.6, representing a new regime significantly higher than early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $968.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by three consecutive arrivals (P5, P6, P7). On-hand inventory remains 0 because demand (637 in P7) significantly exceeds limited arrivals (242 in P7), leading to lost sales. Current pipeline inventory is 2035 units. Demand is showing a strong upward trend: P1-P3 averaged ~207, whereas P4-P7 averaged ~527. The last three periods (P5, P6, P7) had demands of 448, 587, and 637, averaging 557. To account for this growth while preventing excessive holding costs once the larger orders (placed since P4) start arriving, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P4-P7) which average 527.25 units. Since L=4, mu_hat = (1+L) * 527.25 = 2636.25. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture current volatility. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the sustained demand increase we are witnessing.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Last 3 periods averaged 557.3 (+107% vs P1-P3). Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. We are in a high-growth regime with the last 3 periods (P6-P8) demand measuring 587, 637, and 776 respectively, averaging 666.6 units. This is a significant increase from the previous 3-period average of 390. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the observed confirmation that shipments from P1-P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later, we confirm the actual lead time is 4. However, we are currently experiencing total stockouts because historical orders (based on lower demand) are insufficient to meet current demand. To prevent further lost sales, I am using an explicit forecast. mu_hat covering the (L+1=5) period risk window is set based on a forecast of 800 units per period (5 * 800 = 4000), anticipating the growth trend will continue. Sigma_hat is set to 300 to account for the high volatility and upward trend, ensuring the OR backend triggers a sufficiently large order to catch up with pipeline requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Average demand for P6-P8 is 666.7, a 70% increase over the P3-P5 average. Current pipeline is insufficient, resulting in 100% stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1956.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a massive and sustained demand explosion. Demand has risen monotonically from Period 1 (91) to Period 9 (963). The most recent three periods (P7-P9) average 792 units, but the trend is clearly accelerating (+22% from P8 to P9). On-hand inventory is consistently reaching zero every period because orders placed several periods ago are insufficient for current demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by actual arrivals in P5-P9. To compensate for the severe stockouts and the lag inherent in a 4-period lead time, I must project demand for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Given the average demand of the last 3 periods is ~792 and the most recent demand is 963, I will set mu_hat to cover an average of approximately 1000 units per period over the 5-period window (5000 total). This 'explicit' setting is necessary because standard 'recent_N' methods will lag significantly behind this near-exponential growth curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: Demand increased for 8 consecutive periods, reaching 963 in P9 (avg growth ~40% per period since P4). Last 3 periods (P7-P9) average 792.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2160.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a state of hyper-growth. Demand has grown significantly from ~91 in Period 1 to 863 in Period 10, though the growth slightly decelerated in the most recent period (963 in P9 down to 863 in P10). Despite this slight dip, the average demand of the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 867, which is a better anchor for current demand levels. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and sold units have been limited by the physical arrivals (supply-constrained), resulting in continuous stockouts. To break the stockout cycle and cover the (L+1) exposure window (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 5000 (roughly 1000 units/period * 5 periods) to account for continued growth and the need to build safety stock. sigma_hat is set to 250 to allow for a buffer against high volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth peak/plateau: Demand dipped slightly from 963 (P9) to 863 (P10) after 8 periods of expansion, but remains in a high-demand regime averaging >850 units/period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory, reaching a new peak of 1136 in Period 11. The last 3 periods (P9-P11) now average 987.3 units, signaling that the previous regime estimate (~850) was too low. The product has been consistently stocking out (0 ending inventory for every period) because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly trailing current demand. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. To address the massive deficit and provide enough coverage for the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods of demand), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 5250 (1050 units/period * 5). This targets a slightly higher mean than the recent 3-period average to account for the persistent growth trend and the 100% stockout history. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility seen during this hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: Period 11 reached a new peak of 1136 units. Last 3 periods (P9-P11) average 987.3 units, a ~25% increase over the P7-P9 average.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory, reaching 1221 in Period 12. The last three periods (P10-P12) average 1073.3 units, representing a sustained growth phase compared to the previous window. Despite large orders, the system remains in a 100% stockout state because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly lagging behind current demand levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To catch up with this hyper-growth and build safety stock, mu_hat must reflect the most recent high-demand regime. Using N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 based on the most recent 3 periods (P10, P11, P12) will provide an average of ~1073 per period; when multiplied by (1+L) (5 periods), this targets a base stock level that accounts for the current pace. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher demand volumes, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth continues: P10-P12 average demand is 1073.3, a ~35% increase over the P7-P9 average (792). Total 100% stockout condition persists as arrival volumes (from 4 periods ago) are far below current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4084.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience hyper-growth. Last 3 periods of demand are 1136, 1221, and 1246, averaging 1201 units. This represents a sustained upward trend from the previous average of 1073.3 units. Despite increased arrivals (1021 units this period), we remain in a 100% stockout state because historical order sizes (based on lower past demand) cannot satisfy current consumption levels. With a lead time (L) of 4, our look-ahead horizon is 5 periods (L+1). I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 6500 (1300 units/period * 5), which anticipates continued moderate growth from the current 1246 level. Sigma_hat is set to 250 (approx. 112 * sqrt(5)) to capture current volatility. This high mu_hat will trigger the maximum allowable order (cap) to aggressively build the pipeline and eventually break the stockout cycle. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P11-P13) average 1201 units, a ~12% increase over the P10-P12 average. Pipeline remains insufficient, maintaining a 100% stockout status.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5055.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15. The inventory situation is critical: we have 5 units on-hand and 4912 in-transit. Demand has been in a hyper-growth phase for several weeks, recently stabilizing at a very high level (P11-P14 demands: 1136, 1221, 1246, 1265). The last three periods (P12-P14) average 1244 units per period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since the current arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are finally starting to match the demand encountered at that time, our sold units have increased, but we are still effectively in a stockout state with only 5 units left. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), and accounting for the sustained upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) which represent the most recent demand regime of ~1244 units/period. This will force the OR engine to target a base stock roughly 5x that amount (approx 6220 units), helping to close the gap between pipeline inventory and the required stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth plateaued at a high regime: P12-P14 average demand is 1244 units, a 16% increase over the P9-P11 average (1073.3). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4756.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong growth trend. Period 15 demand reached a new peak of 1507 units, which is a ~21% increase over the previous 3-period average (P12-P14: 1244). Despite arrivals increasing, we remain in a near 100% stockout state (sold 1189 of 1507 demand in P15). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the demand has not yet plateaued and is accelerating, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat, but I'll increase the forecast to account for the current upward momentum. The last 3 periods averaged 1339.3 units, but the most recent period was 1507. To proactively address this and the L+1 (5 period) risk, I will set mu_hat explicitly to target a base stock reflecting a 1450 unit/period expectation. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-growth regime. This strategy aims to bridge the gap between current stockout conditions and the accelerating demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 15 reached 1507 units (+21% vs P12-P14 average). Continuous stockout conditions persist despite higher delivery volumes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, reaching a new peak of 1547 in Period 16. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P14-P16) is 1439.7, and the average over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 1417.2, demonstrating a sustained hyper-growth regime. Despite arrivals increasing, we remain in a 100% stockout condition because demand is outstripping historical order quantities. Promised lead time is 4, and consistent arrivals confirm actual lead time is exactly 4. To capture the full demand potential and break out of the stockout cycle, mu_hat must reflect the most recent high-demand regime. Using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust estimate of the current plateau/growth phase (approx. 1417 units/period) while acknowledging the high volatility (+/- 150 units). Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the proven 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P14-P16) average 1440 units, a 15% increase over the P11-P13 average (1252). Persistent stockouts continue as current demand dwarfs arrivals from orders placed 4 periods ago.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3864.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, with Period 17 reaching a new peak of 1724 units. The last three periods (P15-P17) average 1592.7 units, which is a significant increase (~10%) over the previous three-period average (P14-P16: 1440). We remain in a chronic stockout state because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. Our current in-transit inventory is 6059, which covers roughly 3.8 periods of the current average demand (1592), just barely meeting the (L+1) requirement for a 4-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders to break the stockout cycle and account for the upward trend, I will use an explicit lead time of 4 and an explicit mu_hat based on a 5-period horizon (L+1=5) using the most recent average demand (1592 * 5 = 7960). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P15-P17) average 1592.7 units, a ~10% increase over the previous 3-period block. Chronic stockouts persist as arrivals lag behind demand growth.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has led to persistent stockouts as arriving quantities (calculated 4 periods ago based on lower demand levels) cannot keep up with current requirements. The last 3 periods (P16-P18) show demand figures of 1547, 1724, and 1802, yielding a 3-period average of 1691 units. This is a 17% increase over the average of the preceding three periods (P13-P15: 1441). Since the system uses a fixed lead time of 4 periods, we must forecast demand for L+1 (5 periods) using the most recent regime to ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover this growth. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 will base the order on the most current high-demand data, helping to close the gap created by the sustained growth/stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods averaged 1691 units (+17% vs P13-P15). Chronic stockouts remain the primary constraint as arrival volumes (from P14 order) are still below even P16-P18 demand levels.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2075 units in Period 19. The last three periods (P17-P19) average 1867 units, which is approximately a 17% increase over the previous three-period average (P14-P16, 1440 units). We remain in a chronic stockout state because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly lagging behind current demand. To address this, mu_hat must be set using an explicit forecast that captures the expected demand over the next lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the consistent ~10-20% growth per 3-period block, I am forecasting an average of 2100 units per period for the next 5 periods, totaling 10500. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility seen during this hyper-growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P17-P19) average 1867 units, a 30% increase over the average 3 periods prior (P14-P16: 1440). Growth remains consistent at ~10-15% per period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, with the most recent demand in Period 20 reaching 1,973 units. The last 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1,950 units, compared to the previous 3-period average (P15-P17) of 1,592.7 units, a ~22% increase. Chronic stockouts persist as arrivals (governed by orders placed 4 periods ago) consistently lag behind actual demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method aimed at anticipating the next (L+1=5) periods of demand. Given the clear ~10-15% per-period growth trend, I estimate mean demand over the next 5 periods will average ~2,250 units, making mu_hat (1+L) * 2250 = 11,250. This aggressive forecasting is necessary to break the cycle of stockouts and maximize revenue, especially as current pipeline inventory remains insufficient to cover future demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods averaged 1,950 units (+22.4% vs P15-P17). Chronic stockouts persist as arrival volumes fail to reach demand levels, requiring aggressive forward-looking forecasts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has resulted in chronic stockouts since Period 15 (except for a minor surplus in Period 14). Specifically, Period 21 demand was 1983 units, and the average demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) is 2010 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we must forecast demand over a 5-period horizon (L+1). Since the growth is sustained\u2014averaging roughly a 10-15% increase between 3-period blocks\u2014we anticipate demand in the window of Period 22 to Period 26 will likely average higher than the current 3-period average. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most current high-demand regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. Using N=3 (the most recent three periods) ensures the OR backend uses the highest recent average to calculate a base stock that helps mitigate the ongoing stockout situation. The current pipeline of 8898 units is being compared against a projected base stock derived from these updated parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods averaged 2,010 units (+18.9% vs P16-P18). Stockouts remain persistent as supply arrivals (lagged by 4 periods) continue to trail actual demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its sustained growth trend, reaching 2,221 in Period 22. The 3-period average (P20-P22) is approximately 2,059, maintaining a consistent upward trajectory. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since the current period's decision must cover demand for L+1 periods (5 periods) and demand is growing at roughly 5-10% per period, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to project forward. Based on recent demand and growth, a daily forecast of 2,300 is used for the (1+L) horizon (5 * 2,300 = 11,500). Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to account for the heightened volatility during this hyper-growth phase. The current in-transit inventory is 8,233 units, which is significantly below the required buffer for the 5-period horizon, especially as recent arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) are still being fully consumed immediately (sold = arrived), resulting in persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 22 demand reached 2,221. Last 3 periods (P20-P22) average 2059 units (+8% vs P17-P19). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7624.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit hyper-growth, with Period 23 demand reaching 2,326 units. The last three periods (P21-P23) average 2,176 units, which is a significant increase (~8%) from the previous three-period average (2,010 units). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. Despite increasing order sizes, the system remains in a chronic stockout state because the arrivals (lagged by 4 periods) reflect much lower historical demand levels. To catch up and maintain service levels, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent hyper-growth phase. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Given the ~10% period-over-period growth trend, this forward-looking mean (spanning 1+4=5 periods) is necessary for the OR backend to generate a base stock that accounts for the expected demand that will occur before the next order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P21-P23 average demand is 2,176, a ~8% increase over the P18-P20 average (2,010). Growth remains consistent at roughly 10% per period, keeping the system in a perpetual stockout state as arrivals lag current demand by 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive growth trend, with Period 24 demand reaching a new peak of 2,566. The last 3 periods (P22-P24) average 2,371 units, an increase of ~15% over the previous 3-period block (P19-P21: 2,010). The system remains in a near-total stockout state because arrivals are based on orders placed 4 periods ago, which were significantly lower than current demand. To account for this consistent 10-15% per-period growth and the 4-period lead time, a forward-looking mu_hat is necessary. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 2900, which projects demand slightly ahead of the current peak to finally satisfy the growth and overcome the pipeline lag. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 24 to 2,566; 3-period average (P22-P24) is 2,371, up ~15% from the previous block. Persistent stockout conditions continue as supply lags demand by 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching 2,604 in Period 25. The 3-period average (P23-P25) has risen to 2,499 units, confirming a sustained hyper-growth regime. Despite consistent arrivals, we remain in a near-total stockout state because arrivals (determined by orders placed 4 periods ago) lag behind the current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand level, while using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against the high volatility observed during this growth phase. This strategy aims to aggressively build inventory to meet the projected demand four periods from now.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P23-P25) average 2,499 units, representing a ~14% increase over the P20-P22 average (2,185). System remains supply-constrained due to the 4-period lead time lag during hyper-growth.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to face extreme demand hyper-growth, with Period 26 demand reaching 2645 units. The 3-period average (P24-P26) is 2605 units, representing a ~9% increase over the previous 3-period average (P21-P23: 2391). The system remains in a chronic stockout state because the actual arrivals (lagged by 4 periods) reflect much lower demand levels from the past. For Period 27, I am forecasting a continued growth trend. To set mu_hat, I'll use an explicit forecast that projects growth from the current level. Given the trailing 3-period average of 2605 and the most recent demand of 2645, I expect demand to exceed 2750 in the immediate periods. For the L+1 window (5 periods), I will use an average baseline of 3000 units per period to ensure the base stock calculation (3000 * 5 = 15000) allows the OR backend to place orders that finally bridge the gap between in-transit inventory and actual demand requirements. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P24-P26) average 2605 units, a ~9% increase over the P21-P23 average. The stockout condition persists as arrival volumes (from P22 order) are significantly lower than current demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit strong hyper-growth. The last three periods (P25-P27) saw demands of 2604, 2645, and 2890, averaging 2713 units. This is a 14% increase from the previous 3-period block (P22-P24: 2371). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Because lead time is 4 periods, my decisions at Period 28 must cover demand for the next 5 periods (P28-P32). To address the sustained growth and chronic stockouts (selling only what arrives, which was ordered 4 periods ago), I am using an explicit forecast. I project the next 5 periods of demand based on a conservative 10% period-over-period growth starting from the most recent demand of 2890: P28\u22483179, P29\u22483497, P30\u22483846, P31\u22484231, P32\u22484654. The sum for these 5 periods is 19,407. I set mu_hat to 19,400 to ensure the backend attempts to keep the pipeline high enough to chase this growth. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 1500 to account for increasing volatility during this expansion phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods averaged 2713 units (+14.4% vs P22-P24), maintaining 10% period-over-period growth trend.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive linear growth trend. Over the last three periods (P26-P28), demand averaged 2,726 units, with P27 peaking at 2,890. The system remains in a chronic stockout state because arrival volumes (based on orders from 4 periods prior) are consistently lower than current demand. To address this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat based on a 1-period forward projection of the current trend. Current demand is ~2,650-2,900. Estimating Period 29 demand at ~3,000 and applying the (1+L) factor where L=4 means mu_hat = 5 * 3,000 = 15,000. I am also using an 'explicit' higher sigma_hat to account for the increasing variance observed during this hyper-growth phase and to ensure the OR backend targets a high service level to break the stockout cycle. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P26-P28) average 2,726 units, up from 2,605 in the previous block (+4.6%). System remains in persistent stockout as supply lags demand by the 4-period lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a hyper-growth trend, with the most recent 3-period average (P27-P29) reaching 2,782 units. Although Period 29 finally saw ending inventory (496 units) due to the arrival of the large Period 25 order, the system remains in a high-demand state. The current pipeline of 12,953 reflects aggressive ordering in recent periods (specifically the large 4,984 order in P28). To maintain service levels during this upward trajectory, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Following the established trend (approx. 5-10% growth per period), I project Period 30 demand at ~3,000 units. For a lead time of 4 periods, coverage needs to span 5 periods (L+1). 5 * 3,000 = 15,000 units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 15,000 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this target. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: last 3 periods (P27-P29) average 2782 units, up ~2% from the 2726 average in the P26-P28 block, though growth rate appears to be decelerating slightly from previous double-digit increases.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term growth trend, though it is currently exhibiting signs of deceleration. The last three periods (P28-P30) had demands of 2643, 2814, and 2873, averaging 2776.7. This is a very slight increase (+2%) over the previous 3-period block. We are finally seeing ending on-hand inventory (343 units), suggesting that our past aggressive ordering is starting to match demand arrivals. However, with a lead time of 4 periods, we must still cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given the flattening growth rate, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime while acknowledging the stabilized volume. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has significantly decelerated, with the P28-P30 average (2776.7) only 2% higher than P27-P29. The persistent stockout condition has ended as of P29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11578.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand growth has stabilized significantly after a period of hyper-growth. Period 31 demand was 3,046, and the previous two periods (29-30) were 2,814 and 2,873 respectively. The system is no longer in a chronic stockout state, as on-hand inventory ended at 606 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and a 1-period lookahead (total 5 periods), we need to set parameters based on the most recent regime. I will use the last 4 periods (P28-P31) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current high-plateau demand level (~2,844 units per period). L remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. These parameters will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that satisfies the current demand volume while managing the risk of over-ordering as the growth rate flattens.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has plateaued into a high-demand regime; the system exited chronic stockout in Period 29. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P28-P31) is 2,844 units/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a hyper-growth phase to a stable high-demand regime. Demand growth has significantly decelerated over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), with demand averaging approximately 2,876 units. The chronic stockout phase ended in Period 29, and the current ending inventory of 2,585 units indicates that supply is now catching up or exceeding current demand. Period 32 arrivals (4,984 units) were exceptionally high due to a large order placed during the peak of growth (P28), leading to a significant inventory buildup. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level in this new stable regime, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current stable average (~2,876) better than the long-term average. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has plateaued: The hyper-growth trend (P4-P28) has ended. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime averaging ~2,876 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The hyper-growth phase observed from Period 4 to 28 has ended, and demand has transitioned into a high-demand plateau regime. Over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), demand has averaged 2,962 units, with a noticeable step-up in the most recent period (P33 demand: 3,391). Since the system only recently exited chronic stockout (P29), on-hand inventory is finally accumulating (1,134 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we should target a high service level (~80%). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the recent uptick. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the volatility of this new regime accurately, ensuring the OR backend handles the current demand variance without excessive overstocking as growth levels off.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime following the P4-P28 hyper-growth phase; the average demand for the last 6 periods (P28-P33) is 2,962 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has transitioned from a long period of hyper-growth (P4-P28) into a high-demand plateau regime. Over the last 6 periods (P29-P34), demand has averaged approximately 3,083 units, with the last 3 periods (P32-P34) showing a higher average of 3,255 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 34. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrival data. The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the slight upward oscillation in the most recent periods (P33 and P34 both > 3300), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized but slightly increasing high-demand level, while ensuring sigma_hat captures the recent variability in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in a high-plateau regime following hyper-growth; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 3,136.6 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned from a long hyper-growth phase into a high-demand plateau regime. Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 3218.4 units per period (3046, 3005, 3391, 3368, 3282). While the system briefly exited stockouts between P29-P33 due to a large arrival in P32 (from the P28 order), the subsequent lower order volumes from P29-P31 (approx 1800-1900 units each) have caused a return to a stockout state in P34 and P35. Because the pipeline currently consists of larger orders placed once the growth was recognized (starting P32 with orders >3100), the strategy is to stabilize parameters around this new plateau. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this 3200+ average, and using sigma_hat over the same period to account for the recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Average demand for P31-P35 is 3218 units, shifting from the previous P26-P30 average of 2782 (+15.7%). Persistent stockouts returned in P34 due to insufficient order volumes from P29-P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12472.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a high-demand regime with demand averaging approximately 3,300 units per period over the last 5 sessions (P32-P36). Although we exited chronic stockouts briefly in P29-P33, the massive order from P28 (4,984 units) created a temporary surplus that has now been depleted. Demand in P34-P36 (3,368, 3,282, 3,448) has consistently outpaced the arrivals from P30-P32, leading back to a zero ending inventory in P36. The promised (and observed) lead time remains 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts in this high-plateau regime, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (~3,300 units/period), which covers (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the current volatility of this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current sustained volume while accounting for the 4-period lag in supply arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in a high-plateau regime: P32-P36 average demand is 3,299 units. Stockout conditions returned in P34 as the surplus from the P28 order was exhausted.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at a high-plateau regime, with the most recent demand in Period 37 reaching 3,748, the highest seen so far. This suggests that while previous insights noted a plateau, a slight upward drift or high-end volatility is still present. The last 3 periods (P35-P37) average 3,492.7 units. The system is currently in a stockout state (ending on-hand 0 in P37) because delivery volumes (3,142 from P33/L=4) are lagging current demand levels. To restore inventory and maintain a high service level, mu_hat is set based on the last 5 periods (P33-P37) which average 3,447.4 units, representing the current stabilized high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=5 window to capture recent volatility without being skewed by the historical hyper-growth ramp. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-plateau regime with a slight upward drift; average demand for P33-P37 is 3,447.4. Stockout conditions persist as arrivals continue to lag current demand spikes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb in a sustained growth phase, reaching a new peak of 3,929 units in Period 38. The 3-period average (P36-P38) is 3,708 units, which is a ~12% increase over the previous block (P33-P35 avg = 3,347). We are in a persistent stockout state because arrivals from orders placed 4 periods ago (e.g., P34 order of 3,382 units arriving in P38) are consistently lower than the realized demand. To break this cycle and satisfy current demand levels (which will likely exceed 4,000 units in the coming periods), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this upward trend. I will use 4,200 as a base period demand and multiply by (1+L) where L=4, resulting in a mu_hat of 21,000. Sigma_hat is set to recent levels to account for the volatility seen during this expansion. The OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent excessive over-ordering while ensuring we start to bridge the supply-demand gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Last 3 periods (P36-P38) average 3,708 units, a 10.8% increase over the P33-P35 average (3,347 units). Chronic stockouts persist as trailing arrivals fail to keep pace with demand acceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14068.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase of accelerated growth after a brief plateau. Specifically, demand in Period 39 reached 4,212 units, significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of 3,708. The last three periods (P37-P39) show a strong upward trend (3748, 3929, 4212), averaging 3,963 units. Since demand is growing by approximately 5-10% per period and lead time is constant at 4 periods, we are in a perpetual stockout state because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. To address this, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the current momentum, I anticipate average demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) will be roughly 4,500 units per period. Therefore, mu_hat = 4,500 * (4 + 1) = 22,500. For sigma_hat, I will increase it to account for the high volatility during this growth phase. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again starting Period 37: P37-P39 average is 3,963, a ~15% increase over the P34-P36 average (3,366). Chronic stockouts have resumed as demand outpaces the 4-period delivery lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13100.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of hyper-growth and chronic stockouts. Period 40 concluded with a demand of 4,461, following a consistent upward trajectory. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since arrivals (based on orders from Period 36) are significantly lower than current demand levels (3,275 arrived vs 4,461 demanded), and because demand is increasing by roughly 10-15% per period in this most recent phase, I must set parameters to account for this continued growth. The 3-period average (P38-P40) is approximately 4,200 units. Given the trend, demand for Period 41 is expected to exceed 4,500. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to historical lag, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 25,000. This is calculated as (L+1) * Expected_Mean_Demand, where L=4 and Expected_Mean_Demand \u2248 5,000 (anticipating growth over the next 5 periods). This captures the necessity of covering the lead time plus the review period during a sustained growth phase. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the higher volatility observed in this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth accelerated in Period 37: The 3-period average for P38-P40 reached 4,200 units, a 13.5% increase over the P35-P37 average (3,700). Sustained 100% stockout conditions persist as arrivals lag current demand growth.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a strong growth phase, with the last five periods averaging approximately 4,043 units (P37-P41). Period 41 demand (4,166) slightly decreased from P40 (4,461), but the overall trend from Period 37 onwards is significantly higher than the previous plateau. Chronic stockouts have returned because arrivals (originating from orders placed 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. Given the persistent gap between trailing arrivals and current demand, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the current growth regime) to capture the higher mean. However, because we are in a 100% stockout environment where demand is likely still accelerating or at least sustained at these new highs, I must ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to break the stockout cycle once current larger orders arrive. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime confirmed starting Period 37: Average demand increased to ~4050 units, up from the ~3300 unit plateau observed in P32-P36. System has returned to 100% stockout status.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth regime starting around Period 37, currently averaging roughly 4,200 units per period. In Period 42, the demand was 4,040, following 4,166 (P41) and 4,461 (P40). Despite increased arrival volumes, the system remains in a 100% stockout state because arrivals (determined by orders placed 4 periods ago) consistently lag behind current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current high-demand regime (averaging ~4,220 units per period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility in this period. The lead time L is maintained at the default 4, as historical arrivals confirm consistency. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand at the current average will allow the OR backend to generate base stock levels sufficient to eventually break the stockout cycle once the pipeline catches up.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth regime confirmed: Period 39-42 average is ~4220 units/period, a ~28% increase over the P32-P36 plateau (~3300). Chronic stockouts persist as deliveries from P38 and earlier remain below current demand levels.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, for the first time since Period 33, arrivals (4650 units from the Period 39 order) exceeded demand (3950 units), ending the continuous 100% stockout streak. The ending on-hand inventory is 700 units. Demand remains in a high-growth regime starting from Period 37, with the most recent four periods (P40-P43) averaging 4154 units. While demand appears to have softened slightly from the P40 peak (4461), it remains significantly elevated. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new high-demand regime while allowing for the stabilization seen in the last two periods. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers 5 periods (L+1), is grounded in the current scale of demand (~21,000 units target inventory) to prevent a return to chronic stockouts as we enter the final periods of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime confirmed starting Period 37: 4-period average (P40-P43) is 4154 units, representing a stabilization at a higher level than the P32-P36 average (~3300). Ending inventory of 700 in P43 marks the end of a 9-period 100% stockout cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15916.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the system confirmed the stabilization of the recent demand hyper-growth phase. Demand has settled into a high regime averaging approximately 4,150 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44 demands: 4461, 4166, 4040, 3950, 4444). The 100% stockout condition observed between Periods 34 and 42 has ended due to the massive arrival of orders placed during the hyper-growth phase (specifically the P40 order of 5,604 arriving in P44). On-hand inventory now stands at 1,860, and a large pipeline of 14,887 units is in transit (orders from P41-P44). Given the profit of $4.0 vs. holding cost of $1.0, the target service level remains high (80%), but the primary concern is now preventing excessive overstock as demand growth has plateaued and supply has finally caught up. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-plateau demand regime while ignoring the earlier lower-demand periods. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime stabilized at Period 40: Average demand is approximately 4,212 units (P40-P44), representing a new high-plateau following the Period 37-39 acceleration. System exited chronic stockout in P43.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand plateau starting around Period 39-40. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is 4270.8 units, which is significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~3300. The system exited a period of chronic stockouts in Period 43 thanks to the large orders placed in P39-P41 finally arriving. Currently, on-hand inventory is 3145 and in-transit is 13833. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 46 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). A 5-period demand at the current average (4270) is ~21,350 units. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 16,978. I will set mu_hat using recent_6 to reflect the current 4200+ plateau and sigma_hat using recent_6 to capture the volatility of this high-volume stage. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times are stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth regime stabilized at Period 40: New high-plateau average demand is ~4270 units (P40-P45), up from ~3300. System inventory is recovering from chronic stockouts.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand plateau starting around Period 40. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P40-P46) is approximately 4,281 units. While there was a significant dip in arrival volume in Period 46 (due to the small order placed in Period 42), the system is currently well-stocked with 'In-transit' inventory (17,040 units) resulting from the large orders placed in Periods 43-46. As we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50) and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the relevant window for maximizing total reward within the 50 periods. However, to maintain the base-stock policy and account for the current high-demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7). This reflects the current stable plateau of ~4,280 units/period. Sigma_hat is also updated to the recent regime (N=7) to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime following a hyper-growth phase that ended around Period 40. The current average demand (P43-P47) is approximately 4,375 units per period. In Period 47, we experienced a stockout because the arrival of 4,140 units (ordered in P43) was insufficient to meet the demand of 4,595 units. However, looking at the pipeline, large orders placed in Periods 44-46 (3,710, 4,595, 4,595) are scheduled to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. The total in-transit quantity of 17,553 units is very high relative to the remaining 3 periods of the game (P48, P49, P50). To maximize total reward in the final periods, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current 4,300+ units/period regime. lead_time remains stable at 4. The base stock policy will ensure we cover the remaining horizon without over-ordering excessively at the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 44-47 demand averages 4,333 units. Supply chain recovered from Period 42 lull (low order of 1,388); large pipeline scheduled for game end.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime, with the average demand for the last 5 periods (P44-P48) being 4,541.8 units. The system is currently out of stock (ending on-hand at P48 was 0). However, the in-transit pipeline is massive (18,638 units), consisting of orders placed in P45 (4,595), P46 (4,595), P47 (4,653), and P48 (4,795). Since the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50, any order placed in Period 49 (with a 4-period lead time) will arrive in Period 53\u2014well after the game's horizon. Thus, the decision for Period 49 will not result in any arrivals during the active game. My goal is to set parameters that represent the current stable demand regime (recent_N=5) to ensure the OR backend accurately reflects the current state, even though the resulting order won't arrive in time to impact total reward.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The primary goal is to maximize the final period's profit while minimizing ending inventory costs, as there are no subsequent periods to capture demand. Demand has shown a steady upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 4652 units. However, we have a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 18,411 units. Given the 4-period lead time, orders placed now (P50) will not arrive until after the game ends. Therefore, the parameter settings must be optimized to ensure the OR backend does not place an unnecessary final order that would only incur costs if the game logic evaluated ending inventory at P50 conclusion. We set L to the promised 4 periods. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current high-demand regime (~4652 units per period). sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility. The existing pipeline already far exceeds any reasonable base stock level, so the OR engine's capped policy will naturally result in a zero order, which is the optimal move for the final period given the lead time constraint.
