The last four demands were 587, 637, 776, and 963. The OR recommendation of 602 is completely inadequate as it is heavily weighted by early, low-demand samples and doesn't account for the current 900+ demand level. Given the current acceleration (average growth of ~130 over the last 4 periods), I project Period 10 demand to be approximately 1100-1150 units. My goal is to capture this growth and avoid the stockouts that have occurred in 8 out of 9 periods. I will order 1200 units to cover projected demand plus a small buffer, as holding costs ($1) are much lower than the profit ($4) and the risk of another stockout.",

This is based on historical averages (which include the much lower Period 1-5 data) and is significantly lower than even the lowest demand observation from the last three periods (863).
