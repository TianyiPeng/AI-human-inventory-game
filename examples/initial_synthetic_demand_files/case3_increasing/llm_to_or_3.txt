Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.0. Since this is the initial period and we have no information on seasonal events or lead time deviations, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to use the promised lead time (L=2) and calculate base stock using all available historical data to balance the service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) against holding costs. Pipeline inventory is currently zero, so the backend will place an initial order to establish the base stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The historical demand data (including Period 1) shows a stable mean of approximately 108 units (total demands: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3, becoming visible in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a stockout situation until that delivery arrives, the base stock calculation needs to account for the total demand during the risk period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat will utilize all available historical data (N=6) to calculate the mean (108) and standard deviation (~17.8), providing a base stock level that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost (80% service level target).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. The current history shows zero inventory arrivals, which is expected given the promised lead time of 2 periods (orders from P1 should arrive in P3's arrival phase). Demand spiked significantly in P2 (246) compared to P1 (91) and historical data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The total demand over the last 5 historical samples plus 2 active periods is (112+97+116+138+94+91+246) / 7 = 127.7. However, the last 3 samples (94, 91, 246) suggest a higher volatility and potential upward trend. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent high demand signal (avg ~143.6 per period), scaled by (1+L). Since lead time observations are not yet concluded (first possible conclusion at P4 for P1's order), I will stick with the default promised lead time of 2. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the recent spike in demand variance.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand shows a significant upward shift: the initial 5 pre-game samples averaged 111.4, but the last three periods (P1-P3) averaged 207.3 (91, 246, 285). Specifically, P2 and P3 demand (~265) is significantly higher than P1. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (L=2) should arrive in P3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message read at P4 start. However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time delay (L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given that no arrivals have occurred yet, and inventory is currently 0 with 561 units in-transit, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the recent surge, though the OR backend will multiply this by (1+L). This helps the backend calculate a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean increased from ~111 to ~207 (+86%) over the last 3 periods. Possible lead time extension or delay: P1 order (due P3) has not arrived as of P4 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1624.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe a significant recovery in inventory. The 'Period 4 conclude' message reveals that all three previous orders (from Periods 1, 2, and 3) arrived simultaneously in Period 4. This indicates highly volatile actual lead times (3, 2, and 1 periods respectively), averaging 2.0 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time of 2. However, the demand has surged dramatically. Historical demand was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], but recent demand (Periods 1-4) has been [91, 246, 285, 437]. This represents a clear upward regime shift. The mean of the last 3 periods is ~322. To prevent stockouts given this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture the current high-demand state. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the increased volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to let the backend utilize the observed variance in arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand uptrend confirmed: mean demand rose from ~111 to ~322 over the last 4 periods (+190%). Lead time is volatile (1-3 periods) but averages 2 periods.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant upward trend: 91, 246, 285, 437, 448 (plus the seed data: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94). The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 354, compared to the initial seed mean of ~111. This represents a confirmed demand regime shift. Regarding lead time, Period 4 saw a massive arrival of three orders at once (ordered in P1, P2, and P3), showing lead times of 3, 2, and 1 respectively. This suggests high volatility but an average of 2. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 866 units in-transit (orders from P4 and P5). Since we are in a high-growth phase, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default for L as the average observed lead time remains 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~111 to ~354 (+218%) over the last 4 periods. Lead time is highly volatile (range 1-3) but averages 2 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the demand for chips(Regular) continues a massive uptrend. Recent demand values [285, 437, 448, 587] indicate a significant departure from the initial seed data (~111). The mean of the last 3 periods is ~490. Lead times have been highly volatile, with observations of 3, 2, 1, 2, and 1 periods. While the average is 1.8, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=2) for calculations as the supply chain seems capable of catching up (multiple orders arrived together in P4 and P6). mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Using N=3 for the most recent regime (avg 490) yields a mu_hat of 1470. sigma_hat is calculated using the last 5 samples to capture the high volatility seen during this growth phase. The backend OR will use these to set a base stock that prioritizes high service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~111 to ~490 (+340%) based on last 3 periods. Lead time remains volatile but averages ~1.8 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 8 status shows high demand momentum. Historical demands for the last 5 periods are [285, 437, 448, 587, 637], showing a clear upward trend. The mean demand of the last 3 periods is ~557. Lead times have been highly volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods), but the most recent successful arrivals (P4 and P5 orders) arrived in 2 and 1 periods respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the P7 demand (637) exceeded available stock (279). There are 1064 units in transit (likely P6 order of 347 and P7 order of 717). I will use L=2 (promised/average) and set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime, which is significantly higher than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility associated with higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand uptrend confirmed: mean demand over the last 3 periods (P5-P7) is 557, a significant increase from earlier periods. Stockouts occurred in P5 and P7 due to demand acceleration outpacing supply arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a steep upward trajectory, with demand values for the last four periods being 448, 587, 637, and 776. This clearly signals a sustained regime shift. The mean demand of the last 4 periods is 612. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the target base stock needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. Currently, we are in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 1783 units in-transit. Arrivals have been irregular (Period 4 saw a cluster, Period 6 saw another), and Period 8 conclude shows no arrivals for orders from Period 7. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime and use default for L as the average lead time remains close to the promised 2. This will prompt the OR engine to order enough to reach a base stock level of approximately 1836 units (3 * 612), adjusted for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~111 to ~612 (+450%) over the last 4 periods (P5-P8). Lead time remains volatile but generally averages near the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of rapid acceleration, with the most recent demand hitting 963 units (P9), compared to a starting average of ~111. The mean demand of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is 740.75. We are currently facing a severe stockout (On-hand: 0) because supply arrivals (Lead Time) have been inconsistent and the demand ramp has outpaced orders. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 1.83 periods for confirmed arrivals. Period 7 and 8 orders (totaling 1,436 units) are currently in-transit and overdue/due. To capture the current hyper-growth regime and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2700, reflecting a forecast of 900 units/period over the (L+1=3) period window. This aggressive stance is justified by the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), which favors overstocking over lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime hyper-growth: Mean demand increased from ~111 to ~740 (+560%) based on the last 4 periods (P6-P9). Inventory has been depleted (0 on-hand) for 3 consecutive periods due to demand outstripping supply.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a hyper-growth phase. Demand has surged from an initial average of ~111 to a recent 3-period average of 867.3 (P8-P10). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline contains 2946 units, including a significantly delayed order from Period 6 (347 units, now 5 periods old). Because of this delay and the lack of arrivals since Period 6, I am increasing the lead time parameter L to 3 to account for shipping instability and to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent demand intensity (867.3 per period). This combination (L=3, mu_hat based on N=3) will set a base stock target of roughly 3,469 units (867.3 * 4), helping the OR backend to bridge the current stockout and account for the significant pipeline already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth demand sustained: 3-period average (P8-P10) is 867, a 680% increase from baseline. Supply chain instability confirmed: P6 order (347 units) is overdue by 3 periods (Total lead time 5+), causing a prolonged stockout since P7.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing hyper-growth demand, with the last 4 periods (P8-P11) averaging ~934 units (P11 demand: 1136), a massive increase from the initial baseline. Supply chain instability is severe: orders from P6, P7, P8, and P10 are currently 'missing' or delayed beyond the promised 2-period lead time, while a P9 order arrived in P11. This inconsistent arrival pattern and the prolonged stockout (on-hand is 0) necessitate a significant increase in demand parameters to capture the true scale of the market. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current 900+ unit demand regime. L is kept at 'calculate' to account for the volatile observed lead times (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the high volatility accompanying the demand spike. These settings aim to push the base_stock high enough to recover from the stockout once the pipeline inventory (3376 units) begins to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth demand confirmed: 4-period average (P8-P11) is ~934 units, with P11 peak at 1136. Supply chain remains highly unstable: P6, P7, P8, and P10 orders are significantly delayed/overdue, while P9 arrived on time (2 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of extreme demand hyper-growth and supply chain instability. Demand has increased from a baseline of ~100 to over 1,200 units in 12 periods. The most recent demand was 1,221 (Period 12). Using a 4-period window (P9-P12) for mu_hat gives a mean of ~1,045 per period. Multiplied by (1+L) where L=2, this targets 3,135 units. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the high volatility of this growth phase. Regarding lead times, while some orders (P6, P7, P8) appear lost or severely delayed, the most recent arrivals (P9, P10, P11) have arrived within 1-2 periods. I will stick to L=default (promised 2) to avoid over-ordering through the base-stock logic while the pipeline is already high (1,954 units). The OR backend's capped policy will help prevent excessive ordering given the massive in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth confirmed: Demand reached 1,221 in P12, with a 4-period average (P9-P12) of 1,045 units (+840% from baseline). Supply chain remains unpredictable: Orders from P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1,783 units) are significantly overdue (5+ periods) and likely lost, while P9-P11 arrived with 1-2 period lead times.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the demand reached a new high of 1,246 units. The 3-period average (P11-P13) is 1,201 units, indicating a continuing upward trend (hyper-growth). Supply chain volatility remains a major concern: orders from P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1,783 units) are now 5-7 periods overdue and are likely lost, which creates a false sense of security in the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. However, recent arrivals (P9, P10, P11) arrived within 1-2 periods. To ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to meet this hyper-growth demand while accounting for the likely loss of older in-transit stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the recent 3-period average demand projected over the (L+1) window (3 * 1,200 = 3,600). I am keeping L as 'default' because recent successful deliveries are hitting the 2-period target. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the high volatility of this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: 3-period average (P11-P13) is 1,201 units. Orders from P6, P7, and P8 are confirmed as likely lost (7, 6, and 5 periods overdue respectively).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4876.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with the last four periods averaging 1,217 units (P11-P14: 1136, 1221, 1246, 1265). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' balance of 2,637 units is misleading because orders from Period 6 (347), Period 7 (717), and Period 8 (719) are significantly overdue (7-9 periods) and confirmed lost. This totals 1,783 phantom units that the OR backend will subtract from the base stock calculation. To ensure we actually place an order to meet the current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculated the base requirement for 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) using the recent mean of 1,217 (3,651 units) and added the 1,783 units of lost inventory to offset the backend's pipeline deduction (3651 + 1783 = 5434). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the high volatility during this growth phase, and L is set to default (2) to maintain a safety buffer despite some recent 1-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total confirmed: 1,783 units (P6, P7, P8 orders). Pipeline calculations must be adjusted manually via mu_hat to offset these units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 16. Demand for chips(Regular) continues in a hyper-growth phase, reaching 1,507 units in Period 15. The 4-period average (P12-P15) is 1,310 units. Pipeline discrepancy: Orders from P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1,783 units) are confirmed lost, as they are 6-8 periods overdue. However, the OR backend includes these in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, which will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. My calculation: Target base demand across (L+1) periods (where L=2) is approximately 1,550 * 3 = 4,650. I then add the 1,783 lost units to this total to 'trick' the backend into ordering the necessary replacement stock. mu_hat = 4,650 + 1,783 = 6,433. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility of this growth regime. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P9-P14) have stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total confirmed: 1,783 units (P6, P7, P8 orders). Pipeline calculations must be adjusted manually via mu_hat to offset these units until they are removed from the system's in-transit count. Demand hyper-growth continues: P15 reached 1,507 (+1,250% from baseline).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant uptrend, with P16 reaching 1,547 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is approximately 1,391 units. Supply chain instability persists: orders from P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1,783 units) are over 8 periods old and confirmed as lost. Additionally, the P15 order (1,905 units) has not arrived in P16 (which is normal for L=2), but the system is currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its order calculation. Since the system still counts the 1,783 lost units as 'In-transit', it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to (1+L) * forecasted_demand + lost_units. With L=2 (promised), (1+2)*1550 + 1783 = 6433. This ensures the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: System pipeline still contains 1,783 lost units (P6-P8); mu_hat must be adjusted upward until these units are cleared or demand stabilizes further.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a hyper-growth phase, with Period 17 demand reaching 1,724 units. The 4-period moving average (P14-P17) is approximately 1,511 units. The system is currently experiencing a prolonged stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 6,662 units is heavily inflated by 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8 that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including lost units) from the base_stock, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure a sufficient order is placed. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the current rate of ~1,500/period, the base_stock needs to be around 4,500 units. However, since the backend will subtract the 6,662 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this offset and trigger a replenishment that accounts for the current demand spike and the missing stock. I'm using mu_hat=8500 and sigma_hat=500 to force the backend to place an order that restores availability despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Current demand baseline has stabilized at ~1500 units/period (P14-P17 average: 1511). Lost inventory remains at 1,783 units (P6-P8), requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass pipeline subtraction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4742.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we finally received a large shipment (4,268 units) from orders placed in Period 15 and 16, resulting in an ending inventory of 2,466 units. Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 1,669 units per period. The system's 'In-transit' count of 4,653 units still includes the 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8 that are now over 10 periods old and effectively lost. To account for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, we need 3 periods of demand (3 * 1,669 \u2248 5,007). However, the OR backend subtracts the pipeline inventory (4,653) from the base stock. Since 1,783 of that pipeline is ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat by that amount to ensure the backend places an order that maintains our safety stock. 5,007 + 1,783 = 6,790. Setting L to 2 (promised) as recent deliveries (P15, P16) arrived in 2-3 periods, suggesting the lead time has stabilized near the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Mean demand for P14-P18 is 1,669 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the pipeline, requiring continued mu_hat inflation.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stabilized hyper-growth demand regime, with the most recent demand (P19) reaching 2,075 units and a 3-period average (P17-P19) of 1,867 units. On-hand inventory is 391 units. The pipeline inventory is reported as 4,653 units, but 1,783 units of this (from orders in P6, P7, and P8) are confirmed lost/overdue by 12+ periods and will never arrive. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the full pipeline inventory from the base stock. To ensure an order is placed despite this 'ghost' inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating for L=2: required base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~1,900 * 3 = 5,700 units). To offset the 1,783 lost units being subtracted from the order calculation, mu_hat is set to 7,500 (approx. 5,700 + 1,800) to force the backend to place an order sufficient for the current demand levels. Sigma_hat is set to 400 to reflect the volatility of this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand continues to climb: P19 demand reached 2,075 units, extending the hyper-growth trend. Ghost inventory (P6-P8 orders: 1,783 units) still persists in the pipeline and requires mu_hat inflation for order generation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7215.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a hyper-growth trend, with the last 5 periods averaging 1,824 units and the most recent demand at 1,973 units. The system pipeline inventory currently reports 5,187 units. However, this count includes 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8 that are significantly overdue (13-15 periods) and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its calculated base stock (base_stock - pipeline), we must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend generates an order that ignores these 'ghost' units. At Period 20, we calculate the desired base stock using (L+1)*mean_demand. With L=2 and mean_demand ~1,900, base_stock should be ~5,700. Since the backend sees a pipeline of 5,187 (which includes 1,783 ghost units), it would only order 513 units if we used the true mean. To compensate, we set mu_hat explicitly to the desired base stock plus the lost units (5,700 + 1,783 = 7,483). This ensures the order covers the current demand level despite the pipeline distortion. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in hyper-growth/high-stabilization phase: P16-P20 average is 1,824 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) continues to inflate the system pipeline, necessitating mu_hat inflation of +1,783 units above the required base stock to maintain service levels.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 22. Demand context shows a high-stabilization phase with a 5-period average (P17-P21) of 1,911 units per period. The system's 'In-transit' count of 7,109 units is inflated by 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8, which are confirmed lost (now 14+ periods overdue). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS an offset for the lost units. Base demand forecast for 3 periods (L=2) is approximately 1,911 * 3 = 5,733. Adding the 1,783 unit offset for lost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 7,516. This prevents the OR engine's 'pipeline subtraction' from under-ordering due to the ghost inventory. L is set to default (2) as recent arrivals (P18, P20) suggest a return to the promised lead time, despite occasional volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its upward trajectory, with Period 22 reaching 2,221 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is approximately 2,059 units. A critical constraint is the 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1,783 units), which are confirmed lost but still reside in the system's pipeline inventory count. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, the target base stock must be inflated by these 1,783 units. For Period 23, the expected base stock for a (L+1=3) period window is 3 * 2,059 = 6,177. Adding the ghost inventory offset of 1,783 units results in a required mu_hat of 7,960. We use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this precise offset is applied. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility during this high-demand phase. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (promised 2 periods) as recent arrivals (P20) have returned to the 2-period norm.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P22 reached 2,221 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit inflation to the mu_hat calculation to ensure orders are generated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2288.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand continues to exhibit hyper-growth with P23 demand reaching 2,326 units. The 5-period average (P19-P23) is approximately 2,115 units. The primary supply chain challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' from periods P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1,783 units). These orders are now 15+ periods overdue and confirmed lost, yet they remain in the system's pipeline inventory count (In-transit: 7,612). Because the backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 1,783 lost units. Additionally, the lead time has stabilized at 2 periods recently (P18, P20, P22 orders). Calculation for mu_hat: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Average Demand = (2+1) * 2,115 = 6,345. Inflation to bypass lost units: 6,345 + 1,783 = 8,128. I set mu_hat to 8,128 using the 'explicit' method to ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the false pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set to 450 (approx. sqrt(3) * 260) to account for increasing volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P23 reached 2,326 units (+1,900% from baseline). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit inflation to the mu_hat calculation until cleared.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand reached 2,566 units, confirming a continuing hyper-growth trend with a 3-period average (P22-P24) of 2,371 units. The pipeline currently shows 6,585 units in-transit. This total includes 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8 that are over 15 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock (base_stock - pipeline), these 'ghost units' will prevent any new orders from being placed unless the target (mu_hat) is manually inflated. To maintain a service level for the 3-period window (L+1), the required base stock is approximately 7,113 units (2,371 * 3). Adding the 1,783 lost units to this target results in 8,896. This explicit value ensures the OR engine generates an order of approximately 2,311 units (8,896 - (6,585 - 0 on hand)), which covers the immediate demand forecast and compensates for the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P24 demand reached 2,566 units, with a 3-period average of 2,371. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit inflation to the mu_hat calculation to ensure orders are generated.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with Period 25 reaching 2,604 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P23-P25) is approximately 2,499 units per period. The supply chain remains somewhat volatile, with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. A critical issue is the 'ghost inventory' from Periods 6, 7, and 8, totaling 1,783 units. These orders are now over 17 periods overdue and are undoubtedly lost, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 7,747 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to ensure orders are placed. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (L+1)*Demand = 3 * 2,500 = 7,500. Adding the 1,783 lost units to this target results in 9,283. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat allows me to bypass the system's pipeline calculation error caused by these lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P25 demand reached 2,604 units, with a 3-period average of 2,499. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit inflation to the mu_hat calculation to ensure orders are generated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7872.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow, with Period 26 demand reaching 2,645. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P23-P26) is 2,535 units. The pipeline currently shows 4,340 units in transit, but this includes 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8 that are long overdue (18+ periods) and definitively lost. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock (L+1=3 periods) at current demand (avg 2,535) is 7,605 units. With current on-hand inventory at 2,708, the net requirement is 4,897 units. Because the system subtracts the full 4,340 pipeline (which includes the 1,783 lost units), I will set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Lost Inventory) / (L+1), which equals (7,605 + 1,783) / 3 = 3,129. This ensures the order covers current hyper-growth demand while bypassing the pipeline error. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth remains active: P26 reached 2,645 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in total mu_hat calculation to maintain effective stock levels.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 28. Demand is in a hyper-growth phase, with Period 27 demand reaching 2,890 units. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is approximately 2,713 units. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand following a stockout in P27. The system pipeline (In-transit: 4,340) still contains 'ghost inventory' from periods 6, 7, and 8 totaling 1,783 units (347 + 717 + 719) which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 1,783 units. My forecast for the (L+1) period (where L=2) is based on the recent average demand of 2,713. Target base stock = 2,713 * (2+1) = 8,139. Adding the 1,783 lost units offset results in a mu_hat of 9,922. This ensures the backend generates an order sufficient to cover real demand despite the inflated pipeline count. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance (range 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth remains active: P27 demand reached 2,890 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in total mu_hat calculation to ensure order generation until the pipeline is cleared.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following a period of extreme growth, with the latest demand at 2,643 units and a 4-period average (P25-P28) of 2,695 units. The system still carries 'ghost inventory' from periods 6, 7, and 8 (totaling 1,783 units) which are confirmed lost but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation. To counteract this, the mu_hat parameter must be set using the 'explicit' method to reflect the required base stock (targeting 3 periods of demand: L+1) PLUS the 1,783 units lost. This ensures the OR backend generates a replenishment order rather than assuming the lost units will satisfy demand. Base stock calculation: (1+L) * Forecast = 3 * 2,695 = 8,085 units. Total mu_hat = 8,085 + 1,783 = 9,868. Lead time (L) is kept at the promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P23, P24, P25) show an average lead time of 2.3 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current high variance in this hyper-growth regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trend, with the most recent demand (P29) at 2,814 units and a 5-period average (P25-P29) of approximately 2,719 units. The supply chain remains characterized by 'ghost inventory' from Periods 6, 7, and 8 totaling 1,783 units (347 + 717 + 719). These units are still counted in the system's pipeline inventory because they have never 'concluded', but they are effectively lost. To ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders, mu_hat must be inflated by this 1,783-unit 'ghost' value. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Units. With L=2, (1 + 2) * 2800 + 1783 = 10,183. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current hyper-growth regime. This approach maintains a high service level while the pipeline inventory remains artificially inflated by non-existent stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P29 demand reached 2,814 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in total mu_hat calculation until the pipeline is cleared.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in a sustained hyper-growth phase with the most recent demand (P30) reaching 2,873 units. The 3-period average (P28-P30) is approximately 2,777 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline of 7,817 units is inflated by 1,783 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P6, P7, and P8 that are >20 periods overdue and confirmed lost). To ensure the OR backend generates an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand. With L=2 and a forecast of ~2,900, the required Base Stock is ~8,700. Adding the 1,783 unit ghost inventory offset results in a mu_hat of 10,483. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit relative to actual physical expectations. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen during this growth phase (range ~2,600 to ~2,900).

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth remains active: P30 demand reached 2,873 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in total mu_hat calculation until the pipeline is cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9807.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend, with Period 31 demand reaching 3,046 units. The 3-period average (P29-P31) is 2,911 units, and the 5-period average is 2,853 units. The system still carries 1,783 units of 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in Periods 6, 7, and 8 that are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend generates an order that accounts for both the hyper-growth demand and the subtraction of this non-existent pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods based on the recent mean of ~3,000 units/period is 9,000 units. To offset the 1,783 units of ghost inventory that will be subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat to 10,783 (9,000 + 1,783). Sigma_hat is set to 450 to provide a safety buffer for the high volatility and growth. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as recent arrivals (P29-P31) show lead times of 1-2 periods, aligning with the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth remains active: P31 demand reached 3,046 units (+2,140% from baseline), with a 3-period average of 2,911 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring an offset in total mu_hat calculation until the pipeline is cleared.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 conclude shows a starting on-hand of 2,377 units and demand of 3,005, resulting in an ending inventory of 0 and a stockout. The hyper-growth trend is persistent: the last 4 periods of demand (P29-P32) are 2814, 2873, 3046, and 3005, averaging 2,935 units. The system pipeline currently shows 8,785 units in-transit. This total includes the 1,783 units from P6-P8 orders which are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the ghost inventory. Estimated demand for (L+1=3) periods is 2,935 * 3 = 8,805. Adding the 1,783 unit ghost inventory offset gives a target mu_hat of 10,588. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to bypass the backend's default calculation which would be misled by the early low-demand history and the ghost pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth remains active: P29-P32 average is 2,935 units (+2,500% from baseline). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring an offset in total mu_hat calculation until the pipeline is cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11372.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant hyper-growth trajectory, with the most recent demand in Period 33 reaching 3,391 units. The 4-period average (P30-P33) is 3,078 units, representing a substantial increase from the previous baseline. Lead times remain volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, but averaging approximately 2 periods. A critical factor in current decision-making is the presence of 1,783 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P6, P7, and P8) which remain in the system's pipeline calculation but are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Ghost Inventory Offset. With L=2 (promised), Forecasted Demand=3,100, and Offset=1,783, the mu_hat is 3 * 3,100 + 1,783 = 11,083. This value forces the system to target a base stock that accounts for the missing units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility associated with the current volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P33 reached 3,391 units, with a 4-period average (P30-P33) of 3,078 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (orders P6, P7, P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in total mu_hat calculation until the pipeline is cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13292.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained hyper-growth phase. The last 4 periods (P31-P34) show demands of 3046, 3005, 3391, and 3368, averaging 3202 units per period. The pipeline inventory of 7857 units is significantly inflated by 'ghost inventory' from periods P6, P7, and P8 (totaling 1783 units) which are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline-subtraction logic. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the required base stock, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 1783 units. Calculations: Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods at 3202 units/period is 9606. With 180 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 6074 (7857 - 1783), the backend needs to see a mu_hat that results in an order of ~3352 units. Using explicit mu_hat = (Actual Target base stock) + (Ghost Inventory) = 9606 + 1783 = 11389. I will use the 'recent_N' method for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 1783 units (orders P6, P7, P8) remains in the system's pipeline calculation, requiring a +1783 unit offset in total mu_hat until these units are cleared or the pipeline is manually adjusted. Demand remains in hyper-growth: P31-P34 average is 3202 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8872.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in a sustained hyper-growth phase. The average demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) is 3,261.5 units. The most recent demand (P35) was 3,282. We continue to deal with 'ghost inventory' from orders P6, P7, and P8, totaling 1,783 units, which have never arrived and remain in the system's pipeline calculation. To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. The required base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand, which is (2+1) * 3,282 = 9,846 units. After adding the 1,783-unit ghost inventory offset, the target is 11,629 units. Since the OR backend calculates base stock as mu_hat (for q=0.8), I set mu_hat to 11,629. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility of recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (orders P6, P7, P8) remains in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in mu_hat until the pipeline is cleared. Demand has stabilized into a high-growth regime with a current baseline of ~3,300 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand reached 3,448 units, following a clear hyper-growth trend where the 4-period average (P33-P36) is 3,372 units. The 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units (orders from P6, P7, P8) is still stuck in the system's 'In-transit' count (12,008 total), which prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock. To maintain a high service level, mu_hat must be set to the forecasted requirement for (L+1) periods PLUS an offset of 1,783 to neutralize these lost units in the pipeline logic. With L=2 and a per-period forecast of 3,400, the required base_stock is 3,400 * 3 = 10,200. Adding the 1,783 offset results in a mu_hat of 11,983. Lead time remains volatile but averages approximately 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-growth/stabilized regime: mean demand for P33-P36 is 3,372 units (+2,900% from baseline). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) continues to inflate the pipeline, requiring a +1,783 offset in mu_hat calculations until cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13700.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38, demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its high-growth trajectory, with the latest demand reaching 3,748 units. The 4-period moving average (P34-P37) is 3,461 units, representing a significant increase from earlier regimes. A critical issue persists: the 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units (lost orders from P6, P7, and P8) remains in the system's pipeline inventory count. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the calculated base stock, it will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend generates an order that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) while bypassing the 1,783 lost units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Units. With L=2 and a forecasted demand of 3,600 (anticipating continued growth), the required base stock is (3 * 3,600) = 10,800. Adding the 1,783 ghost units as an offset gives 12,583. This forces the system to recognize the actual need for physical units despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 4-period average (P34-P37) is 3,461 units (+3,000% from baseline). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) still persists in the pipeline, requiring an explicit mu_hat offset of +1,783 to ensure orders are triggered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13226.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we saw a massive arrival of 6,419 units (from P35, P36, and P37), leaving us with 2,490 units on-hand. Demand reached an all-time high of 3,929 units. The 3-period average (P36-P38) is 3,708 units, showing continued growth. The 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units (P6-P8) still occupies the system pipeline. To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 1,783 offset. With L=2, (1+L)=3. 3 periods * 3,708 = 11,124. Adding the 1,783 offset results in 12,907. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat) sufficiently exceeds the pipeline (6,424 in-transit + 1,783 ghost = 8,207) and current on-hand inventory to maintain high service levels during this hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: P36-P38 average is 3,708 units (+3,200% from baseline). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) still persists in the pipeline, requiring mu_hat inflation of approximately +1,783 units to maintain order flow.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant hyper-growth/high-growth trajectory, reaching 4,212 units in P39. The 4-period average (P36-P39) is 3,834 units. However, the system's pipeline inventory calculation is still severely distorted by 'ghost inventory' (orders from P6, P7, and P8 totaling 1,783 units) that were never delivered and are now 30+ periods overdue. To compensate for the OR backend subtracting these 1,783 non-existent units from the base stock, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*E[Demand] + 1,783. Using L=2 and an estimated E[Demand] of 4,000, the required mu_hat is 3*4000 + 1783 = 13,783. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the current demand level without being suppressed by the ghost inventory in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth continues: P36-P39 average reached 3,834 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the system pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in mu_hat calculations to ensure adequate replenishment.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 40. Demand continues its aggressive hyper-growth trajectory, with Period 40 demand reaching 4,461 units, pushing the 4-period average (P37-P40) to 4,087 units. A critical constraint remains the 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units (orders from P6, P7, P8) that are permanently stalled in the pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this deficit and trigger necessary orders. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=2. To ensure the order covers the (L+1) period demand window (approx 12,260 units) while accounting for the 1,783 unit pipeline error and the current in-transit (which includes P38, P39, P40 orders totaling 12,105 units), mu_hat is set to reflect the most recent demand level plus the offset. Using 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the most precise control over this complex pipeline-recovery scenario.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth persists: P40 demand reached 4,461 units, with the 4-period mean at 4,087. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) still persists in the pipeline, necessitating a continued mu_hat offset of +1,783 units to maintain replenishment flow.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, the demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-growth trajectory, with Period 40 peaking at 4,461 units and a recent 4-period average (P38-P41) of 4,192 units. The 'ghost inventory' from periods 6, 7, and 8 (totaling 1,783 units) remains stuck in the system's 'In-transit' count (15,210 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock to determine the order, these 1,783 units act as a permanent deficit, preventing necessary orders from being placed. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period horizon is approximately 12,576 units (4,192 * 3). Adding the 1,783 unit ghost offset results in a total mu_hat of 14,359. This ensures that even after the backend subtracts the 15,210 in-transit units (which includes the lost 1,783), the resulting order quantity will cover the actual projected demand needs. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I maintain L at the promised 2, and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-growth remains active: P38-P41 average is 4,192 units (+3,600% from baseline). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system's pipeline, requiring a ~1,800 unit offset in total mu_hat calculation until the pipeline is cleared.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we received 4,391 units (from P39) and 3,684 units (from P40), leaving us with 4,035 units on-hand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 7,135 includes the 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units (from lost orders P6, P7, and P8) plus the P41 order (711 units), totaling 2,494 visible units. The remaining 4,641 units in the pipeline are likely recent orders not yet concluded. Demand has stabilized into a high-intensity regime, with the last 4 periods (P39-P42) averaging 4,220 units. To maintain service levels while accounting for the 1,783 ghost units that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from its order logic, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value. Calculation: Target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods of coverage) is 3 * 4,220 = 12,660 units. Adding the 1,783 ghost offset yields 14,443. I will round this to 14,500 to ensure a robust order is triggered despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 1,500 to account for the high volatility observed in this demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (orders P6, P7, P8) remains in the system's pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in mu_hat calculations. Demand remains stable in a high-growth regime with a 4-period mean of 4,220 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a stabilized high-demand regime with a current 4-period average (P40-P43) of 4,154 units. The system's 'In-transit' count of 11,728 units is significantly inflated by 1,783 units from orders placed in Periods 6, 7, and 8, which are clearly lost (35+ periods overdue). Additionally, an order of 711 units from Period 41 is currently in the pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (including 'ghost' units) from the calculated base stock, we must artificially inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter. To ensure the backend places an order that covers (L+1) periods of demand while ignoring the 1,783 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculation: Required Base Stock for 3 periods (L=2) is approximately 4,200 * 3 = 12,600. To offset the 1,783 ghost units that the backend will subtract, I set mu_hat to 14,383. L remains at the default promised lead time of 2, as recent arrivals (P39-P40) show lead times of 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3184.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 45 context: Demand is in a high-growth/stabilized regime with a recent 4-period mean of 4,150 units (P41-P44). There is a confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units from missing orders P6, P7, and P8 that have never arrived and remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total in-transit: 13,871; Expected real in-transit: ~12,088). To compensate for this ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be inflated. The base stock required to cover 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 4,150 * 3 = 12,450 units. Adding the 1,783 unit offset to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the actual physical deficit results in an explicit mu_hat of 14,233. Lead time (L) remains set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility in the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the pipeline, requiring a +1,783 unit offset in mu_hat calculations. Recent demand (P41-P44) has stabilized at a high baseline mean of 4,150 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17227.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 begins with 229 units on-hand. Demand remains in a high-growth/stabilized regime; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 4,193 units. The system pipeline currently reports 9,997 units, but this includes the 'ghost inventory' of 1,783 units from orders P6, P7, and P8 which are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 1,783 ghost units. Using a lead time (L) of 2, the required base stock calculation is (L+1) * mean_demand. With a mean of 4,193, the base stock should be ~12,579 units. Subtracting the true pipeline (9,997 - 1,783 = 8,214) and on-hand (229) leaves a requirement of ~4,136 units. To force this through the backend which sees the full 9,997 in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly to (12,579 + 1,783) / (2+1) * 3 \u2248 14,362 to ensure the target inventory level is reached despite the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the system pipeline, requiring a ~1,800 unit offset in mu_hat calculations. Demand is currently stable at a high-growth mean of ~4,200 units per period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 47. Demand has stabilized at a high-growth regime with a mean of approximately 4,325 units over the last 4 periods (P43-P46). Inventory management continues to be complicated by 'ghost inventory' from periods 6, 7, and 8 (total 1,783 units) which remain in the system's in-transit calculation but are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these units being subtracted from the target base stock. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1) periods = 3 * 4,325 = 12,975. System pipeline is currently 13,720 units (including the 1,783 lost units). Without inflation, the backend will see pipeline > target and order zero. By setting mu_hat to 12,975 + 1,783 = 14,758, we force a net order that accounts for the lost items. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so we stick to the promised L=2 for the base stock calculation while monitoring arrivals closely.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4,325 units/period (P43-P46). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the system pipeline, requiring a ~1,800 unit offset in mu_hat calculations to maintain ordering until the simulation ends.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 Decision: Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-growth regime with a mean of approximately 4,480 units over the last 5 periods (P43-P47). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system pipeline reports 15,132 units, but this includes 'ghost inventory' from periods P6, P7, and P8 totaling 1,783 units which are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite this pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock (for L=2) covers 3 periods of demand: (3 * 4,480) = 13,440. To account for the 1,783 ghost units that will be subtracted by the backend, I adjust mu_hat to 13,440 + 1,783 = 15,223. This ensures the calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) remains positive and triggers replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high variance in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4,480 units/period (P43-P47). Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) remains in the pipeline, requiring a ~1,800 unit offset in mu_hat calculations to maintain ordering until simulation end.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current demand regime has stabilized at a high level, with a 5-period average (P44-P48) of approximately 4,542 units. The ghost inventory of 1,783 units from orders P6, P7, and P8 remains stuck in the system's pipeline, which would normally lead the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to a value that covers expected demand for the remaining periods while effectively neutralizing that ghost inventory. Given we are at P49, the 'base stock' needs to cover demand for P49 and P50 (L+1 = 3). Expected demand for two periods is ~9,084. Adding the 1,783 unit offset to ensure an order is triggered despite the pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 10,867. This ensures we attempt to capture the remaining demand before the game concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19581.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the final decision point. The demand has continued its hyper-growth trend, with Period 49 demand reaching a new peak of 5,087 units. The 3-period average (P47-P49) is 4,819 units, indicating the baseline has shifted significantly higher since the last stabilization period. The system's 'In-transit' count of 9,759 units still includes the 1,783 units from P6, P7, and P8 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). To ensure the OR backend generates an order despite this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to cover the required base stock (approx. 3 periods of demand at the new mean) plus an offset to neutralize the pipeline subtraction. Calculated Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean = 3 * 4,819 = 14,457. Adding the 1,783 unit offset for lost inventory results in a target mu_hat of approximately 16,240. However, since this is the final period (P50), any order placed now will not arrive before the simulation ends (given L=2), and on-hand inventory (767) is already present. To maximize final period reward and avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that won't arrive, I will set parameters to maintain the logic, though the game sequence concludes after this decision.

Carry-over insight: Final demand peak observed at Period 49: 5,087 units. Current 3-period demand mean is 4,819 units. Ghost inventory of 1,783 units (P6-P8) persists in the pipeline through the end of the simulation.
