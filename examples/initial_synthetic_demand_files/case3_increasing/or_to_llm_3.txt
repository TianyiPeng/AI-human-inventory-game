We are currently stocking out (sold 0 in P1 and P2 because starting inventory was 0). \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 218 units.

At the start of Period 5, I have 0 on-hand inventory because all orders are still in transit. \n2. Demand Analysis: There is a significant demand regime shift. Historical samples were ~111. Recent actual demands are P1: 91, P2: 246, P3: 285, P4: 437. The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 322 units, which is much higher than the historical baseline. \n3. Pipeline Inventory: Total in-transit is 847 units (141+138+218+350). These are expected to arrive in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively, assuming the 4-period lead time holds. \n4. Inventory Position Calculation: The target inventory level should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent average of 322 units, the required stock is 322 * 5 = 1610 units. Current inventory position is 0 (on-hand) + 847 (in-transit) = 847 units. Gap = 1610 - 847 = 763 units. \n5. OR Recommendation Evaluation: The OR recommendation of 276 units is based on historical averages (including the very low pre-shift samples) and is capped. It significantly underestimates the current demand regime. \n6. Final Strategy: I will override the OR recommendation to more aggressively target the current demand levels. However, I must be wary of the cap formula. Since the OR cap is based on old data, I will manually increase the order to 440 units, which is closer to the most recent demand peak (437) and helps bridge the inventory gap without over-ordering before the first shipment (P1) confirms the lead time.",

The most recent two periods suggest demand is stabilizing or still growing at ~440. 4. OR Recommendation Analysis: OR recommends 152 units. Looking at the OR logic, it uses all history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 91, 246, 285, 437, 448]. This including the old low-demand regime significantly drags down the base-stock calculation. We need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At a current rate of ~440/period, we need 2200 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline is 1146. 5. Strategy: The OR's 152 units is far too low to meet the new demand plateau (440+). Even if I order the OR cap (which is roughly what I will do), I am still under-stocked relative to recent demand.

A 5-period requirement at this level is ~21,100 units. While the current pipeline of 22,500 units appears sufficient to cover this, we have faced consistent stockouts for the last 9 periods because past orders (3,500 units) were insufficient for the subsequent growth.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "This is Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. In the final period, the primary objective shift from maintaining a pipeline to maximizing ending profit by minimizing holding costs and unnecessary inventory. Current state: On-hand inventory is 8,754 units. Previous period demand (P49) was 5,087 units, and the recent 3-period average is approximately 4,819 units. Given that the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed today (Period 50) would arrive in Period 54, which is beyond the game's duration. Therefore, any quantity ordered now would only incur holding costs (if the game were to continue) and would not contribute to sales or satisfy any demand within the active period of play. Additionally, the existing on-hand inventory of 8,754 units is more than sufficient to cover the demand for Period 50 (estimated at ~5,000-5,100 units based on the current growth trend). Ordering more would subtract from the total profit without any potential for additional revenue.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Final period (P50). Ordered 0 units because any order placed now would arrive after the game ends. Current inventory (8,754) is sufficient to cover final period demand.",
