Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) results in a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17. Since we have no specific calendar dates or product descriptions to suggest seasonality, and no arrival history yet to evaluate actual lead time, I will use the baseline statistics. The OR parameters will be set to use the available historical data (N=5) to calculate the base stock. The target inventory level needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the order was placed and 91 units of demand were lost because we started with 0 on-hand inventory. Since L=4, we do not expect this order to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). The current in-transit amount is 141. Given the historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the Period 1 demand of 91, the mean demand is approximately 108. Since there is no evidence yet of a lead time shift or a demand regime change, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples including Period 1) to stabilize the forecast around the observed mean. This will help the OR backend calculate the base stock for the (L+1) horizon which is 5 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (avg=111.4). In Period 1, demand was 91, but spiked significantly in Period 2 to 246. This could be a seasonal shift or random variance; however, given the limited history, I will treat the average across the 2 available game periods (avg=168.5) as the new baseline until a pattern stabilizes. The promised lead time is 4. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as L=4 means the P1 order (141 units) should arrive in Period 5 and be visible in the Period 6 start message. Inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. The pipeline inventory (141 + 138 = 279) is correctly tracked. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the low sample size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods; the first order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Current In-transit is 628 units (141 + 138 + 349). Historical demand samples show a significant shift: from a pre-game mean of 111.4 to recent demands of [91, 246, 285]. The demand has increased markedly over the last two periods. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this upward shift in demand (\u03bc\u0302) and volatility (\u03c3\u0302), while maintaining the promised lead time (L) of 4. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the higher current demand level.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5, meaning they will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (available at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0, and all previous orders (141+138+349+377 = 1005 units) are correctly accounted for in-transit. Demand has shown a clear upward trend over the first four periods (91, 246, 285, 437) compared to the initial pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this growth in demand mean and volatility while waiting for the first shipment to arrive to confirm lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. We have 0 on-hand inventory because demand (448) significantly exceeded the arrival (141). There is a massive demand spike occurring: past demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (avg ~111) has shifted to [91, 246, 285, 437, 448] (avg ~301) over the last 5 periods, with a clear upward trend. In-transit inventory is high (1363 units), which covers about 3-4 periods of current high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this new, higher demand regime (avg 301.4, std 147) and ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently to meet the 4+1 period lead-time window. Using recent_N helps the base-stock calculation adapt to the volatility and increased volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: Average demand increased from ~111 to ~301 (+170%) with high volatility (std ~147). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Demand history shows a significant shift starting around Period 2. The most recent demand samples [246, 285, 437, 448, 587] indicate a high-growth regime with an average of ~400 units and substantial volatility. Total in-transit inventory is 1,648 units, but we are currently stock-out (on-hand = 0) because arrivals are just catching up to the initial ordering phase. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1)=5 period horizon during this upward expansion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2 confirmed: avg increased from ~111 to ~400 in last 5 periods with std ~140. Lead time stability at 4 periods confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand is steadily increasing, with the last three periods showing demands of 448, 587, and 637. The 'Carry-over Insights' already flagged a regime shift starting at Period 2. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is approximately 478.8 with a standard deviation of 145.7. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4), meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Although on-hand inventory is 0, arrivals are consistent with the 4-period lead time. To ensure the OR backend captures this sharp upward trend and high volatility, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime. This will set a base stock level sufficient to handle the ~2400 units needed for the 5-period horizon, while accounting for the ~1913 units already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: last 3 periods (P5-P7) avg demand is 557, significantly higher than the initial regime shift estimate of 400. Standard deviation remains high (~145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive and sustained upward trend, shifting from an initial average of ~111 in Period 1 to an average of 666 over the last three periods (P6-P8). The current period (P9) inventory situation remains critical with 0 on-hand units and high lost sales, though arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 and pipeline is being resolved at the old demand rates, I must set parameters to account for the current 'high-growth' regime. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the most aggressive growth phase (P5-P8 average: 612) while providing enough statistical buffer for the OR backend's safety stock calculation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth demand regime confirmed: Period 5-8 average demand is 612 units, increasing from previous estimates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1996.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently increasing, showing a clear regime shift. The initial demand periods (pre-Period 2) averaged ~111, but the last five periods (P5-P9) show a significantly higher average demand of 682.2 units (448+587+637+776+963/5), with the most recent demand hitting 963. Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1-5. Currently, ending inventory remains at 0, indicating lost sales and under-stocking because order quantities haven't caught up with the acceleration. To account for this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current high-demand environment (~682 per period), and L to 4 as observed. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility (std ~210) associated with this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 5-9 average demand reached 682 units, with a peak of 963 in Period 9. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1692.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend. Recent demand values from Period 5 to 10 are [448, 587, 637, 776, 963, 863], with a clear acceleration. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (Period 6-10) is approximately 765 units, compared to the mean of the last 3 periods which is approximately 867. Given the consistent growth, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime while maintaining some statistical stability. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all concluded shipments (P1-P6), so I will use the default promised lead time of 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 3161 units in-transit, which reflects the lag between ordering and arrival. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods will help the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period horizon of demand (~3825 units required in pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 6-10 average demand is 765 units (compared to 612 in P5-P8), with a peak of 963 in P9. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2456.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 875, significantly higher than previous regimes. Standard deviation over this period is approximately 181. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' is 3506 units, but 'On-hand' is 0, indicating we are consistently under-stocking relative to the accelerating demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest growth trend and increase safety stock for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Using N=5 balances the need to react to growth while maintaining a minimum sample size for variability estimation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 7-11 average demand reached 875 units (compared to 765 in P6-P10). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly in recent periods. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 1221, while the 5-period average (P8-P12) is 991. The service level is currently poor due to stockouts, as demand is significantly outstripping arrivals based on older, lower order quantities. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since the current period is 13, I will focus on the most recent 5-period window (P8-P12) to capture this aggressive growth for forecasting. To ensure the OR backend generates a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 991.8 = 4959, and sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of this same period, which accounts for the high volatility (~188.8 per period).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 8-12 average demand reached 992 units (compared to 875 in P7-P11). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3340.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 13 seen a demand of 1246, maintaining the growth regime started around Period 5. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 1086 units, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (P8-P12) of 992 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. We are currently facing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for several periods) because the growth is outstripping previous base stock calculations that relied on older, lower demand means. To capture this rapid growth while maintaining a high service level (given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am focusing on the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to set the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This results in a mu_hat covering the 5-period risk window (L+1) based on a current local mean of ~1086 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 9-13 average demand reached 1086 units (compared to 992 in P8-P12). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4020.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is experiencing a sustained and aggressive demand growth regime. Demand has increased from an average of ~111 in the first few periods to 1265 in the most recent period (P14). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 1146.2, and the last 3 periods (P12-P14) show an even higher average of 1244. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (P1-P10 orders) exactly 4 periods after ordering. On-hand inventory remains at 0 because demand consistently exceeds arriving shipments, resulting in significant lost sales. To address this, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-growth regime while providing enough historical data to stabilize the variance estimate. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to better meet this rapidly escalating demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 10-14 average demand is 1146 units (compared to 992 in P8-P12). Peak demand reached 1265 in P14. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3836.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, reaching a new peak of 1507 in Period 15. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 11-15) show values of [1136, 1221, 1246, 1265, 1507], resulting in a recent 5-period average of 1275. Based on this growth rate, I am forecasting next period's demand to be approximately 1400. In a (1+L) base-stock model with L=4, mu_hat represents the expected demand over 5 periods. Using the forecasted average of 1400, mu_hat is set to 7000 (1400 * 5). Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the last 5 periods (~140) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 313. On-hand inventory remains at 0 due to demand consistently outstripping supply arrivals, so we must maintain a high base stock to capture this growth. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 11-15 average demand is 1275 units (compared to 1146 in P10-P14), with a new peak of 1507 in P15.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. In Period 16, demand reached a new high of 1547. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is approximately 1417 units. Multiplied by (1+L) where L=4, this sets the base stock level to target 7086 units. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 5528, resulting in a pipeline inventory of 5528. This will trigger a significant order to close the gap and account for the high growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P12 order arriving exactly in P16.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 12-16 average demand is 1417 units (compared to 1275 in P11-P15), with a new peak of 1547 in P16.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 17 demand reached 1724 units, a new peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 1457.8 units, while the average over the last 3 periods (P15-P17) is 1592.7 units. Given this aggressive acceleration, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this growth while maintaining some stability against single-period spikes. Based on the history, lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have been stock-out for several consecutive periods (demand > arrived), mu_hat needs to reflect the current high demand level to ensure future orders are large enough to build safety stock and bridge the gap. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 13-17 average demand reached 1458 units (compared to 1275 in P11-P15), with a new peak of 1724 in P17.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 18 demand reached a new peak of 1802. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), the average demand is 1568 units. Given the consistent growth, using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering the most recent acceleration) will yield a more representative mean than the lifelong average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 due to demand consistently outstripping supply arrivals, the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to capture this growth. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to reflect the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 14-18 average demand reached 1568 units (compared to 1458 in P13-P17), with a new peak of 1802 in P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5224.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Period 19 demand reached a new peak of 2075. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P15-P19), the average demand is approximately 1731 units per period, representing a significant increase from the 1568 average observed in the P14-P18 window. Lead time (L) remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on all conclusions since Period 5. With a lead time of 4, the order cycle covers 5 periods (L+1). To account for the rapid growth and minimize stockouts (given current on-hand is 0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent growth surge of 1731 units/period. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth phase. This strategy aims to elevate the base stock to match current demand levels, allowing the capped policy to safely order against the pipeline inventory of 6887 (which consists of orders from P16-P19).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 15-19 average demand reached 1731 units (compared to 1568 in P14-P18), with a new peak of 2075 in P19.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has consistently outpaced supply, resulting in zero ending inventory for 20 consecutive periods. In Period 20, demand reached 1,973 units, and the average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 1,824 units. To address this sustained growth and minimize the persistent stockout situation, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand levels (1547, 1724, 1802, 2075, 1973). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5 through P20). Therefore, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend reacts to the current high-demand regime and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 16-20 average demand reached 1824 units (compared to 1731 in P15-19). Lead time stability at 4 periods remains confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6212.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 21 demand (1983) and the average of the last 5 periods (P17-P21 = 1911) demonstrate that we have entered a new regime. Service levels have been consistently 100% missed because arrivals are lagging behind demand growth. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since the growth is sustained and accelerating, I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach to capture the most recent demand shift accurately, which currently averages ~1911 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of approx 5 * 1911 = 9555. By using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will scale stock levels to meet the 80% service level target (implied by $4 profit / $1 holding cost) based on the latest high-volatility, high-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 17-21 average demand reached 1911 units (compared to 1824 in P16-20). Market continues to scale sharply upward.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward linear-like trend. Period 22 demand reached 2221 units, and the 5-period average (P18-P22) is now 2010.8 units, compared to 1911 in the previous period's analysis. The lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory consistently hitting 0 and pipeline inventory supporting current growth, it is essential to set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime to capture the current velocity. I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand level and volatility (which increases as the mean increases). The target is to ensure base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 18-22 average demand reached 2011 units (compared to 1911 in P17-21). Growth trend remains uninterrupted.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward growth trend. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P19-P23), demand has been: 2075, 1973, 1983, 2221, 2326, resulting in an average of 2116 units per period. The standard deviation over this period is approximately 157. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this high-velocity growth by using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, ensuring the stock levels are prepared for the current demand regime. With L=4, the pipeline needs to support 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current ending inventory is consistently 0 because demand exceeds the arrivals from several periods ago; therefore, aggressive ordering is necessary to catch up to the market scale.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 19-23 average demand reached 2116 units (compared to 2011 in P18-22). The upward trend remains strong and consistent.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 24 demand reached a new peak of 2566. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 2213.8, while the average over the last 3 periods (P22-P24) has escalated to 2371. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating we are still facing stockouts as arrived units (from orders 4 periods ago) are insufficient to meet current demand. To address the accelerating trend and high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the most recent growth phase) and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility. This will increase the base stock calculation to better match the projected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 20-24 average demand reached 2214 units (compared to 2116 in P19-23), with a new peak of 2566 in P24.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. In the most recent 5-period window (P21-P25), demand values were 1983, 2221, 2326, 2566, and 2604, averaging 2340 units per period. This is an increase from the previous 5-period average (P20-P24) of 2214. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since the growth is linear and persistent, using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this high-growth regime while accounting for the significant volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently met. On-hand inventory is zero, and we are in a stockout-limited sales environment, so aggressive parameters are necessary to catch up to the demand curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 21-25 average demand reached 2340 units (compared to 2214 in P20-24). The upward trajectory remains consistent with no signs of leveling off.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate aggressively. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 2472 units, compared to 2214 in the previous 5. Demand has grown from ~91 in P1 to ~2645 in P26, showing a consistent upward trajectory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently selling out arrived stock, we must use parameters that project the growth through the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent growth and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a buffer for the high variance during this growth phase. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 22-26 average demand reached 2472 units (compared to 2214 in P20-24). The strong upward trend persists with no sign of saturation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and consistent upward trend. Over the last five periods (P23-P27), the average demand has grown to approximately 2666 units, with the most recent observation at 2890. The stock-on-hand remains at 0, indicating that demand is consistently outstripping supply arrivals. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since the market is scaling sharply, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat. Given the current trend, I anticipate demand for Period 28 to be approximately 3000-3100. Calculating mu_hat for (1+L) = 5 periods, 5 * 3100 = 15500. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the high volatility associated with this rapid growth phase. This aggressive setting aims to increase the base stock and capture more of the mounting demand, as current arrivals are insufficient to build any safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 23-27 average demand reached 2666 units (compared to 2472 in P22-26). The upward trajectory remains very strong with the latest peak at 2890 in Period 27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 2669.6 units, but the most recent period (P28) demand was 2643, following a peak of 2890 in P27. Since demand is consistently scaling and often exceeding the previous average, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-growth regime while ensuring sigma_hat (also recent_N, N=5) accounts for the significant volatility observed during this expansion. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. Using recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (mean approximately 2670) will forecast a demand across (1+L) periods of about 13,350 units. Given the in-transit inventory of 11,768 and 0 on-hand, this will prompt a substantial order to cover the continuing growth and prevent lost sales, especially since on-hand inventory has been consistently depleted to 0 every period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 24-28 average demand reached 2670 units (compared to 2666 in P23-27). The upward trajectory remains very strong with consistent stockouts occurring due to demand outpacing supply.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. In the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand was [2604, 2645, 2890, 2643, 2814], with an average of approximately 2719. However, looking at the broader trend communicated in carry-over insights, the demand has been scaling consistently. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. A simple average of the last 5 periods (2719) likely underestimates the demand we will face over the next 5 periods if the growth continues. I'll use an explicit mu_hat based on an estimated forward average demand of 2950 units per period (2950 * 5 = 14750) to ensure we don't stock out during this growth phase. Volatility (sigma_hat) is set explicitly to account for the high variance observed during this scaling (std of last 5 periods is ~125, so sqrt(5)*125 ~ 280, but I will use 350 to be safe).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 25-29 average demand reached 2719 units. The trend remains strongly positive with periodic stockouts occurring as demand consistently exceeds historical averages.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and consistent upward trend. In the last five periods (P26-P30), the average demand has reached approximately 2773 units (2645, 2890, 2643, 2814, 2873), with the current ending inventory at zero due to persistent stockouts (demand consistently exceeding arriving stock). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the market is scaling rapidly, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent, high-demand regime without being overly influenced by the lower historical data. Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time stability. This configuration helps the OR backend set a base stock level that targets a high service level while accounting for the significant growth and volatility observed in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 26-30 average demand reached 2773 units (compared to 2719 in P25-29). Lead time stability at 4 periods remains consistently confirmed across all arrivals.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong, sustained upward trajectory. In the most recent period (P31), demand reached a new peak of 3,046 units. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is approximately 2,853 units, up from the previous 5-period average of 2,773 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Since we have been experiencing repeated stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for almost every period), the OR backend needs to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand level plus the growth trend. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the most recent growth regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 27-31 average demand reached 2853 units (compared to 2773 in P26-30), with a new peak of 3046 in P31. Stockouts continue as demand consistently exhausts arriving inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11338.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward linear trend. In Period 32, we observed demand of 3005, following a peak of 3046 in Period 31. The 5-period moving average has risen significantly, now sitting at approximately 2876 ((2643+2814+2873+3046+3005)/5), compared to previous averages. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have finally moved out of a complete stockout state (ending on-hand inventory is 682), we must set parameters that allow us to maintain this service level while accounting for the continued growth. To capture the most recent and highest demand levels effectively, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most aggressive recent demand statistics (mean ~2876, std ~156) to calculate the base stock for the (L+1) period window. This approach balances the need to satisfy the growing demand while acknowledging the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 28-32 average demand reached 2876 units (compared to 2773 in P26-30). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the Period 33 demand reaching a new peak of 3391. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 3025.8, up from 2853 in the previous analysis. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this momentum by using the most recent 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend reacts to the accelerated growth, while maintaining an explicit L of 4 to reflect the historical consistency of arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 29-33 average demand reached 3026 units (compared to 2876 in P28-32), confirming a persistent upward trajectory and frequent stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend. Period 34's demand was 3,368, and the average for the last five periods (P30-P34) is approximately 3,138. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as it matches the observed reality. To capture the most recent demand growth and mitigate ongoing stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime (avg ~3,138 per period) while acknowledging the significant volatility. Given the 4-period lead time, the ordering window (L+1) covers 5 periods of forecasted demand. The backend logic will use this to target a base stock sufficient to cover the peak demand seen in recent periods, while the 'cap' mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering if the trend were to suddenly invert.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 30-34 average demand reached 3138 units, compared to 3026 in P29-33. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and sustained upward trajectory, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) reaching approximately 3,218 units, compared to 3,138 in the previous window. A new peak occurs almost every period, and current arrivals are consistently failing to meet this demand, leading to repeated stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on all historical arrival data (the P31 order arrived in P35, confirming L=4). To account for the sharp growth and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period window to capture the current demand level. This balances the need for a higher base stock with the OR backend's risk-aversion (holding cost is 25% of profit). Using N=5 for sigma_hat provides a local volatility estimate that reflects the current high-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 31-35 average demand reached 3218 units (compared to 3138 in P30-34). Persistent stockouts continue as arriving inventory is exhausted by demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12372.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 3,299 units, with the most recent demand hitting 3,448 units in P36. Persistent stockouts are occurring because the arriving inventory, limited by the OR backend's defensive capping, is immediately exhausted. To ensure we capture this growth and satisfy more demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window (P32-P36) will give the OR engine a more accurate baseline of the current demand level (~3,300 per period), allowing for higher order caps and better fulfillment of the (L+1) period demand cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 32-36 average demand reached 3299 units (compared to 3218 in P31-35). Consistent stockouts persist as demand continues to significantly outpace realized arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12568.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and persistent upward trend. In Period 37, demand reached a new peak of 3,748 units, while the arriving shipment (ordered in Period 33) was only 3,142 units, leading to a total stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), the average demand is approximately 3,447 units, significantly higher than the 3,138 average observed just four periods ago. This confirms a sustained growth regime. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. To address the persistent stockouts and the rapid demand growth, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most current demand level (approx 3,447 per period, so 17,235 for L+1). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to account for the increasing volatility associated with higher demand volumes. Since the lead time is stable, L=default is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 33-37 average demand reached 3447 units (compared to 3138 in P30-34). Continuous stockouts persist as demand growth outpaces historical ordering levels.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and consistent upward trend. In Period 38, demand reached a new peak of 3929. Comparing the most recent 5-period average (P34-P38: ~3555) to the preceding 5-period average (P29-P33: ~3026), there is a significant sustained increase of approximately 17%. The inventory position remains constrained, with the system repeatedly stocking out (ending on-hand=0) because realized arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand levels. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 19,000. This is calculated as (L+1) * forecasted demand = 5 * 3800. I have chosen 3800 as a conservative but forward-looking estimate given the last two demands were 3748 and 3929. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on all recent 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the high volatility inherent in this rapid growth phase, providing the OR backend with a realistic basis for the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 34-38 average demand reached 3555 units (compared to 3138 in P30-34), with a new peak of 3929 in P38. Stockouts persist as demand consistently outpaces arriving orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14068.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and sustained upward trajectory. In Period 39, demand reached a new peak of 4212, which significantly exceeds the arrival of 3517 units (ordered in Period 35). This mismatch has resulted in a persistent 0 ending inventory for the last 7 periods (except for a small surplus in P32). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in Period 39 of the order placed in Period 35. To address the accelerating demand and mitigate stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent growth surge (average demand for P35-P39 is approx 3720). Given the sharp increase in both mean and volatility, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate buffer. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the latest demand levels during the lead time + review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 35-39 average demand reached 3724 units (compared to 3555 in P34-38), with a new peak of 4212 in P39. Market expansion remains extremely aggressive with consistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13144.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive linear growth pattern, reaching an all-time high of 4,461 in Period 40. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 3,958, significantly higher than previous rolling averages. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since the system is constantly stocking out (ending inventory is zero in 8 of the last 9 periods), there is a high probability that true demand is even higher than recorded sales. I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect historical stability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (the minimum for a sustained trend) to capture the most recent growth trajectory, which projects an expectation of (1+L)*3958. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility accompanying this rapid scaling.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 36-40 average demand reached 3958 units (compared to 3724 in P35-39), with a new peak of 4461 in P40. Continuous stockouts persist as demand consistently outpaces arriving orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13928.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) reaching 4203 units, significantly higher than previous periods. The peak demand reached 4461 in P40. We have been experiencing persistent stockouts because the ordered quantities (based on earlier, lower demand averages) are insufficient to meet the rapidly scaling market. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41). To address this, I am setting L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect historical stability. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P37-P41) to capture the most recent, highest demand regime (average ~4203). This results in a mu_hat of approximately 21,015 units for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility associated with this high-growth phase. This strategy aims to force the OR backend to place larger orders that catch up with the realized demand trajectory while accounting for current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 37-41 average demand reached 4203 units (compared to 3958 in P36-40), with a recent peak of 4461 in P40. Continuous stockouts persist as demand consistently outpaces arrivals.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend. Period 42 demand was 4040, slightly lower than the recent peak but consistent with a high-growth regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 4161.6 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the P42 arrival (ordered P38). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this high-demand plateau/growth and ensure the base stock is calculated using the latest evidence, as demand has consistently outpaced older historical averages. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these values to set the base stock for L+1 periods (5 periods), helping to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 38-42 average demand reached 4162 units (compared to 3958 in P36-40). The high-growth trend persists with consistent stockouts due to demand outstripping incoming supply.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to grow aggressively, currently in a high-growth regime. In Period 43, demand was 3950, with a recent 5-period average (P39-P43) of 4166 units and a peak of 4461 in P40. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. To capture the recent trend without being overly sensitive to any single period's volatility, I am using a recent_N approach with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures that the base stock calculation reflects the current market scale (~4100-4200 per period) rather than the lower historical averages. Setting L to 4 using the calculate method, as the lead time is stable. The backend OR logic will compute the base stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand, accounting for the current high pipeline of 16785 units and the small on-hand stock of 451.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 39-43 average demand reached 4166 units. Growth remains strong with a peak of 4461 in Period 40. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) reaching approximately 4212 units. This reflects a significant and sustained increase from the previous estimates. Period 40 saw a peak of 4461, and Period 44 demand was 4444. On-hand inventory is 342 units, and the pipeline is substantial at 16410 units, but this is necessary to cover the (L+1) horizon in a high-growth environment. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most current demand level (approx 4212 * 5 = 21060 across the horizon), as the long-term average significantly understates current needs. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 40-44 average demand reached 4212 units (compared to 4166 in P39-43), with Period 44 demand at 4444 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16896.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive, sustained growth trend throughout the game, moving from ~100 units to over 4,000 units. In the most recent window (Periods 41-45), demand has stabilized at an extremely high level, averaging approximately 4,193 units (P41: 4166, P42: 4040, P43: 3950, P44: 4444, P45: 4364). Lead time remains reliably stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 560 units, which is low given the daily demand magnitude. To ensure maximum sales and minimize the recurring stockouts observed in history, I am using a recent window of N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for both the 4-period lead time and the 1-period review cycle (L+1=5) based on the most up-to-date market scale.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 41-45 average demand is 4,193 units, stabilizing after a long period of aggressive growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18117.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we observe that the aggressive demand growth seen over the last 40 periods has stabilized. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is approximately 4,266 units, compared to the P41-P45 average of 4,193. Demand in P46 was 4,530. On-hand inventory is essentially zero (3 units), but the pipeline is very large (16,826 units) due to recent high-volume orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal now is to maintain a steady state and avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current stabilized demand level (~21,330 for L+1 periods) without being overly influenced by the previous explosive growth phase. sigma_hat with recent_N=5 accounts for the current volatility in this high-demand regime, ensuring a reasonable safety stock to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization confirmed: Period 42-46 average demand is 4,266 units, showing a deceleration from the previous exponential growth trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15592.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned from an aggressive growth phase into a high-volume steady state, averaging approximately 4,266 units over the last five periods (P42-P46). However, recent demand in P47 spiked to 4,595, and we ended the period with zero on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), the priority is ensuring enough inventory arrives to cover the final periods without excessive leftovers. Given lead time is 4, an order placed today (P48) arrives in P52 (outside the game), meaning our available inventory for the rest of the game is entirely dependent on current on-hand (0) and the specific units arriving in P48 (4,335 units, ordered P44), P49 (4,582 units, ordered P45), and P50 (4,376 units, ordered P46). The parameter choices for P48 will not affect actual arrivals within the game's timeframe but are set using 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime, while L remains at the stable 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Final demand stabilization confirmed around 4,300-4,500 units per period (P43-P47 average: 4,376).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the objective is to satisfy demand for the final two periods of the game (49 and 50). Demand has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with recent samples (P44-P48) being 4444, 4364, 4530, 4595, and 4776, averaging 4542 units. Despite this stabilization, the 'Carry-over insights' and latest data suggest demand is still slightly leaning upward or at least remaining firm at the ceiling of the previous growth spurt. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this latest stable-but-high level (average ~4542 * 5 periods = 22710). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods across all historical arrivals. With only 18,401 units in transit and 0 on-hand, we are currently under-provisioned relative to the expected demand of ~22,710 units across the (L+1) horizon. Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant recent volatility and mean to calculate the base stock and generate an order that bridges this deficit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18380.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime between 4,300 and 4,800 units based on recent observations (P45-P49 average: 4,670). The most recent demand (P49) reached 5,087, indicating a possible final spike or slightly higher plateau than previously estimated. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. My objective is to set parameters to cover demand through the lead time (L) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. Using N=5 for Recent_N captures the current stabilized regime (P45-P49). On-hand inventory is 0, and pipeline inventory is 18,411. Since this is the final period, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will determine the final procurement. I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most current demand levels and volatility, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu is sufficiently high to satisfy the final stretch of demand without excessive over-ordering, though holding costs only apply to ending inventory which is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in Period 45-50 at a high-volume regime (avg ~4670, peak 5087). Lead time remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the observation history.
