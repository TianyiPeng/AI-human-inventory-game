Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no historical 'conclude' messages to verify actual lead time, so we rely on the promised lead time of 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows an average of 111.4 over the last 5 samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. There is no specific calendar date or secondary context to suggest a regime shift yet. Since target inventory (base stock) needs to cover demand for (L+1) periods, and current on-hand and in-transit are zero, we will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the full available historical demand set) to establish a baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures we are reactive to the most relevant recent volatility while the backend handles the service level calculation based on the provided profit ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 91, which is fairly consistent with the historical mean of approximately 111.4 (samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94). Given that we have only 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation, I will use a window of N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining stability. The current on-hand inventory is 36, and the OR backend will calculate the order based on a base stock policy (using mu_hat and sigma_hat) to cover the current period's demand (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 91 with a lead time of 0. In Period 2, demand spiked significantly to 246, leading to a stockout (sold 124, ending inventory 0). The current history (including pre-game samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and observed [91, 246]) shows a mean demand of approximately 128 units. However, the last demand was more than double the previous average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent increase in volatility and mean demand more quickly than the 'default' (all samples) method. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $876.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant structural break. Past demand (pre-game) averaged 111.4 units, but actual demand in Periods 2 and 3 spiked to 246 and 285 respectively. This suggests a new regime or a significant promotional/seasonal event. My goal is to catch up to this higher demand level to avoid stockouts, as sold units were limited by on-hand inventory in the last two periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods is holding true, as evidenced by 'arrived' units matching 'ordered' units within the same period. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the recent high-demand observations (91, 246, 285) over the older, lower data points, effectively raising the base stock level to meet the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 2: Avg demand increased from ~111 to ~207 (+86%) based on 3 game periods, leading to stockouts in P2 and P3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1176.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are facing a severe and accelerating demand surge for 'chips(Regular)'. In the last three periods (P2, P3, P4), demand has been 246, 285, and 437 respectively, significantly exceeding our inventory each time and resulting in total stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods is holding, as shipments arrive within the same period they are ordered. Given the rapid escalation (from ~250 to ~440 in one period), the previous 'recent_N' approach is lagging. I am switching to 'explicit' for mu_hat to forecast Period 5 demand around 500 units (accounting for potential continued growth) and increasing sigma_hat to 100 to provide a larger safety buffer against this high volatility. Setting L to 0 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend recognizes the same-period arrival mechanism and maintains high availability (Total Demand Coverage = (L+1) * mu).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated in Period 4: Demand jumped from ~265 (P2-P3) to 437 (P4), marking a >50% week-over-week increase and sustained stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1655.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. Historical demand for the last four periods (P2-P5) has been 246, 285, 437, and 448 respectively, showing a marked upward trend compared to the initial state (avg ~111). The shift started at P2 and accelerated at P4. After consecutive stockouts in P2, P3, and P4, the aggressive order in P5 (585 units) finally met demand (448 units), leaving 137 units on-hand. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 recorded conclude messages. I am setting L to 'calculate' to continue verifying this. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to focus on the most recent demand plateau (avg of 437 and 448), as the regime has significantly shifted from the early periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N with N=4 to capture the high volatility observed since the regime shift began in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher tier: Periods 4 and 5 show an average demand of 442.5, significantly higher than the already elevated P2-P3 average (~265). Current demand is roughly 4x the starting baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2120.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a massive regime shift. Initially averaging ~110, demand surged in Period 2 and has continued to climb, reaching 587 in Period 6. We have experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods because the OR backend's order cap (based on historical statistics) is lagging behind the actual scale of demand. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be confirmed by the history. Since we are in a high-growth phase, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to capture the most recent, higher-tier demand levels (Periods 4-6 have an average of ~491). I am setting N=3 to specifically isolate this most recent peak and ensure the OR engine increases the order cap sufficiently to stop the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continues to escalate: Period 6 demand (587) is over 30% higher than the already elevated P4-P5 average (~442), confirming a sustained upward trend rather than a single peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2248.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant and sustained upward trend across the last several periods. Specifically, starting from a baseline of ~100 in Period 1, it rose to 246-285 (P2-P3), then jumped to 437-448 (P4-P5), and most recently surged to 587-637 (P6-P7). This represents a consistent growth pattern where demand essentially doubles every 2-3 periods. Despite placing large orders, we are starting Period 8 with 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 7 (sold 562 units against 637 demand). Given L=0 (confirmed by arrival history), my mu_hat needs to cover the current period's demand (N+L). Using an N=3 for recent demand trends gives an average of 557.3 [(448+587+637)/3], but this is lagging behind the most recent value of 637. Given the growth rate (~10% growth P6 to P7), I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat to 700 to account for the likely continued trend and ensure we break the cycle of stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the volatility of this high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed as parabolic: P6-P7 average demand (612) is 38% higher than P4-P5 average (442.5), which was in turn 67% higher than P2-P3. Sustained stockouts occurred in 5 of the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3095.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sharp upward trend, increasing from 637 in Period 7 to 776 in Period 8. The average demand over the last three periods (P6-P8) is 666.67, with a standard deviation of 96.7. Given the consistent stockouts and the rapid, parabolic growth identified in the carry-over insights, the historical mean is not a reliable predictor for current needs. I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this most recent high-growth regime (Periods 6, 7, and 8). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all concluded periods. Using N=3 ensures the OR backend uses a mean near 667 and a higher volatility estimate, which is necessary to prevent further stockouts in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P8 demand (776) is 22% higher than Period 7 (637), and the 3-period average (P6-P8) has reached ~667 units, a six-fold increase from the initial baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3000.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive, parabolic growth pattern. Period 9 demand reached 963, a 24% increase from Period 8 (776) and a nine-fold increase from the Period 1 baseline. We have experienced stockouts in 7 out of 9 periods because the OR backend's capped policy (based on historical mean and 0 lead time) cannot keep pace with this trajectory. The current 3-period average (P7-P9) is 792, but the most recent data point (963) suggests we must forecast significantly higher to avoid another stockout. I am setting mu_hat to 1200 units using the explicit method to anticipate continued growth and create a sufficient buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high volatility during this transition. Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic and uncurbed: Period 9 demand (963) is 24% higher than Period 8 (776). The 3-period moving average has risen to ~792, but the backend cap is consistently lagging the actual demand surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2904.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a powerful upward trend. Although demand in Period 10 (863) was slightly lower than Period 9 (963), it remains extremely high compared to earlier periods, and the historical trend suggests parabolic growth. The 3-period moving average (P8-P10) is 867 units. In Period 10, the order was finally large enough to end with positive inventory (548 units), but the OR backend's order cap remains a significant constraint as demand climbs. To ensure the backend places orders that keep up with this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. Based on the recent growth rates (typically 20-30% expansion per period), I forecast Period 11 demand at approximately 1,100 units. Since L=0, mu_hat should equal (1+L)*forecast = 1,100. I am also increasing sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this growth phase, setting it to 200 to ensure the base_stock calculation targets a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains high but showed first sign of fluctuation in P10 (863) vs P9 (963). However, the 3-period average (P8-P10) of 867 units is still 30% higher than the previous 3-period average (P6-P8) of 667, confirming a sustained high-demand regime.

Period 11 demand hit a new peak of 1136 units, which is a 31% increase over Period 10 (863) and well above the previous 3-period average. We have experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in most recent periods because the backend order 'cap' (based on historical statistics) lags behind this parabolic growth. My primary goal is to shift the base stock and cap upward to capture this surge. To achieve this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will forecast Period 12 demand at 1250 units (following the ~10% to 30% growth pattern). Since the promised lead time (L) is 0 and the actual observed lead time has consistently been 0, the calculation for mu_hat across (1+L) periods is (1+0)*1250 = 1250. For sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 4 to reflect the increased volatility seen during this high-growth phase. This combination aims to bypass the restrictive cap by providing a higher mean forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 11 (1136 units), a 31% increase over Period 10. The 3-period moving average (P9-P11) is now 987 units, surpassing all previous baselines and confirming the parabolic trend is not yet plateauing.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its parabolic growth trajectory. Period 12 demand reached 1,221 units, a slight increase from Period 11 (1,136) and significantly higher than Period 10 (863). The 3-period moving average (P10-P12) is 1,073 units, while the 5-period average (P8-P12) is 991 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. To account for the uncurbed growth and prevent stockouts while managing the backend cap, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat based on a conservative projection of next period's demand (at least 1,300 units) and use a higher sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility associated with this scale of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic: P12 demand (1,221) continues the upward trend. The 3-period moving average has climbed from 792 (P7-P9) to 1,073 (P10-P12), a ~35% increase in three periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a parabolic growth trajectory, with Period 13 demand reaching 1,246 units. The 3-period moving average (P11-P13) has risen to 1,201 units, compared to 1,073 units last period and 987 units previously. Although on-hand inventory has buffered recent demand, the growth rate suggests we need to stay ahead of the curve. The backend OR engine uses a cap based on lead time (L) and variance (sigma). To ensure the 'cap' does not artificially restrict our orders during this aggressive growth, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most current 1,200+ unit demand level, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a wider buffer. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic: P13 demand (1,246) marks a new high, with the 3-period moving average (P11-P13) reaching 1,201 units, maintaining a ~12% growth rate over the previous rolling average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4997.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a parabolic growth trend. The last three periods show demands of 1,221 (P12), 1,246 (P13), and 1,265 (P14), with the demand consistently pressing against or exceeding the on-hand inventory. The 3-period moving average has risen to 1,244 units. However, given the sustained week-over-week growth (which has averaged roughly 10-20% during the recent regime), I need to forecast a value that prevents the backend OR 'cap' (mu_hat / (1+L) + z*sigma_hat) from restricting the order size below the expected demand for Period 15. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized, meaning orders arrive within the same period. To stay ahead of this growth and account for potential further acceleration, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1,450 (approx 15% above P14 demand) and using a high sigma_hat of 150 to ensure a robust safety stock, as under-ordering has been the primary constraint on profit in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and linear-to-parabolic: P12-P14 average (1,244) is 26% higher than P9-P11 average (987). Stockouts or near-stockouts have occurred in 11 of the 14 periods played so far due to supply-side caps lagging demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a parabolic or aggressive linear trend. Period 15 demand reached a new high of 1,507 units, representing a 19% increase over the previous period (1,265). The average demand of the last 3 periods (P13-P15) is 1,339 units. However, because the demand is still trending upward sharply, using a historical average (even recent_N) will result in a mu_hat that lags well behind the actual demand realization in Period 16. To prevent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1,800. This value projects a ~20% growth on the P15 demand, which is consistent with the recent trend (P14 to P15 was ~19%). Since lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, L is set to 'default'. Sigma_hat is set to 250 using 'explicit' to account for the increased volatility observed as the demand scale grows.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 15 demand (1,507) is a 19% increase over Period 14 (1,265). The 3-period average (P13-P15) is 1,339. The parabolic trend has not yet peaked, requiring forecast values significantly above historical means.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with the latest demand in Period 16 reaching 1,547 units. The 3-period moving average (P14-P16) is now 1,440 units, a significant increase from the previous 1,339 average. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values that forecast this continued growth. Setting mu_hat to 1,800 provides a buffer for the expected demand in Period 17, which follows the ~200-unit-per-period growth trend observed over the last few cycles. sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for the increasing volatility that accompanies this rapid growth, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level while the cap remains the primary constraint.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 16 demand (1,547) is an increase over Period 15 (1,507), with the 3-period average (P14-P16) rising to 1,440 units (+7.5% from previous). The growth trend continues to be sustained for 15+ periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 17 reaching a new high of 1,724 units. This is an 11.4% increase over Period 16 (1,547) and significantly higher than the previous 3-period average. The 3-period moving average (P15-P17) is now approximately 1,593 units. Given the consistent parabolic growth, setting mu_hat using a 'recent_N' approach with a small window (N=3) would yield ~1,593, which is likely already too low for Period 18 based on the current trend. To ensure the inventory meets the projected demand and to keep the OR backend's cap from prematurely restricting the order size, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate Period 18 demand at approximately 1,900 units (projecting the ~10-15% growth trend seen recently). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the current regime's volatility, and L remains 'default' since the observed lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and persistent: Period 17 demand (1,724) is a 11.4% increase over Period 16. The 3-period average (P15-P17) has risen to 1,593. This marks over 15 periods of sustained growth with no plateau yet visible.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7012.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive, parabolic growth. Period 18 saw demand reach 1,802 units, marking a 4.5% increase over Period 17 (1,724) and maintaining a 3-period average (P16-P18) of 1,691. Since Period 2, the demand has increased by over 1600%. To prevent stockouts and satisfy this rapid growth, I must set \u03bc\u0302 ahead of the current rolling average. Given the persistent 5-15% period-over-period growth, I am forecasting 1,950 units for Period 19. Using the 'explicit' method for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 allows me to bypass the OR backend's historical averaging and capping mechanism, which has consistently lagged behind the actual demand curve. The lead time L is confirmed as 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 18 demand (1,802) is a 4.5% increase over Period 17, with the 3-period moving average (P16-P18) rising to 1,691 units. This marks 17 periods of sustained, roughly parabolic growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8298.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive and parabolic growth. Period 19 demand reached 2,075 units, a 15% increase over Period 18 (1,802). The 3-period moving average (P17-P19) has risen to 1,867 units. Due to the rapid pace of growth, standard 'recent_N' or 'default' methods consistently underestimate the next period's needs because they average in lower historical values. To stay ahead of this trend and prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently only 2 units), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I forecast Period 20 demand at approximately 2,300 units (maintaining the ~10-15% growth rate). Since L=0, mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods of demand, so I set mu_hat to 2,300. I am also setting an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 250 to provide a robust safety buffer, as the volatility typically increases alongside the mean in such growth phases. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic and accelerated in Period 19: Demand jumped 15% WoW to 2,075 units. The 3-period moving average (P17-P19) is now 1,867, a 10% increase from the previous (P16-P18) average of 1,691. This sustained trend has now lasted 18 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive, roughly parabolic growth trend. Period 20 demand was 1,973 units, and although it decreased slightly from Period 19 (2,075), the overall trajectory remains sharply upward with a 3-period moving average (P18-P20) of 1,950 units\u2014a 16% increase over the previous (P15-P17) average of 1,691. Since the backend OR engine's internal cap is based on historical means, it consistently lags the actual demand growth. To counteract this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, forecasting a demand of 2,250 units for Period 21. This estimate accounts for the recent average plus an anticipated ~10-15% growth step to ensure availability and avoid stockouts. I will continue to use recently observed volatility (last 5 periods) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance in this high-demand regime. Lead time is confirmed at 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P18-P20 average (1,950) is 16.5% higher than P15-P17 average (1,673). Despite a slight dip in P20, the 19-period growth trend remains the dominant feature of the demand profile.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained parabolic growth trend, now spanning 20 periods. Period 21 demand was 1,983 units, following 1,973 in Period 20 and 2,075 in Period 19. The 3-period average (P19-P21) is 2,010 units, which is 19% higher than the P16-P18 average of 1,691. While demand has plateaued slightly around the 2,000 mark over the last three periods, the historical pattern suggests we must remain aggressive to avoid stockouts, as the OR backend's order cap frequently lags these surges. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target of 2,100 units (accounting for potential continued growth). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility while ignoring the early-game low-demand data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth persists at a high level: The P19-P21 moving average is 2,010 units, a 19% increase over the P16-P18 average. Demand has transitioned from a sharp parabolic rise to a high-volume regime exceeding 2,000 units per period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive growth trend, with Period 22 demand reaching 2,221 units, a 12% increase from the previous period (1,983). The 3-period moving average (P20-P22) is now 2,059, confirming that demand has moved into a >2,000 units/period regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts in this parabolic environment, mu_hat must be set aggressively to capture the expected next peak. Given the consistent WoW growth of 10-15% observed in recent periods, a forecast of 2,400 (roughly 8% above the last observed demand) is appropriate to ensure the base stock calculation stays ahead of the trend. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and has entered a >2,000 units/period regime as of Period 22. The 3-period moving average (P20-P22) is 2,059, representing a sustained upward shift from the P17-P19 average of 1,867 (+10%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $9111.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2,326 units in Period 23. This marks a ~12% increase from the previous 3-period average (P20-P22: 2,059). The 3-period moving average (P21-P23) has now climbed to 2,176 units. Although the growth rate is slowing compared to the early parabolic phase, it remains consistently positive and high-volume. The Lead Time (L) is stable at 0 periods, confirmed by\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01 arrivals since Period 1. To address the persistent under-forecasting and stockouts (ending on-hand only 1 unit in P22, 193 in P23), I am using 'explicit' methods to project demand slightly ahead of the current trailing average. Setting mu_hat to 2,450 (approx. 5% above the most recent demand) and sigma_hat to 250 (reflecting recent volatility between ~2,000 and ~2,300) will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that sufficiently covers this growing demand while respecting the L=0 constraint.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and has reached a >2,300 units/period regime as of Period 23. The 3-period moving average (P21-P23) is 2,176, up from 2,059 (+5.7%) in the prior window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10169.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2,566 units in Period 24. This represents a 10% increase over the Period 23 demand (2,326) and a 10% increase over the 3-period moving average (P21-P23) of 2,177. The 3-period average for P22-P24 is now 2,371 units. Given the parabolic nature of the demand growth observed over the last 20+ periods, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,800 to account for an anticipated 10-15% growth in Period 25 and to ensure the backend cap does not stifle availability during this sustained surge. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N window of 5 to capture the high volatility associated with this growth stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic and has entered a >2,500 units/period regime as of Period 24. The 3-period moving average (P22-P24) is 2,371, up from 2,176 (+9%) in the prior window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10010.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive, nearly parabolic growth. Period 25 demand reached 2,604, and the 3-period moving average (P23-P25) is now 2,498 units, representing a 5.4% increase over the previous (P22-P24) average of 2,371 units. Since the lead time remains consistently 0 periods, the strategy is to chase this growth closely to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, justifying a high service level (80% critical ratio). I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 2,800 to account for the sustained upward momentum and ensure the order cap (which is based on mu_hat) does not throttle the replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained and has entered a >2,600 units/period regime as of Period 25. The 3-period moving average (P23-P25) is 2,498, up from 2,371 (+5.4%) in the prior window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10209.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a sustained parabolic fashion. The most recent demand (P26) was 2,645 units. Comparing the 3-period moving average of P24-P26 (approx. 2,605) to the previous P21-P23 average (approx. 2,177) shows a ~20% growth in just three periods. To prevent stockouts, mu_hat must be set to reflect this latest trajectory. mu_hat is set to 2,750 (explicit) to account for the current demand level plus a buffer for the expected continued growth in Period 27. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility inherent in this growth phase, ensuring the OR engine maintains an appropriate safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and has entered a >2,600 units/period regime as of Period 26. The 3-period moving average (P24-P26) is 2,605, up from 2,371 (+10%) in the P22-P24 window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11542.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its sustained upward trend. Period 27 demand reached 2,890 units, the highest recorded to date. The three-period moving average (P25-P27) is 2,713 units, compared to 2,498 in the P23-P25 window, representing an 8.6% increase. This confirms the 'parabolic' growth pattern identified in carry-over insights is still in effect. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. To prevent stockouts in this high-growth environment, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' at 3,100 units\u2014approximately 7% above the last observed demand\u2014to proactively account for continued growth, as the OR backend's default and recent_N methods tend to lag during rapid expansion. sigma_hat is set to 250 (roughly 8-9% of mean) to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the high volatility seen in recent spikes. L remains default (0) as the delivery mechanism is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P27 demand (2,890) is a new peak, and the 3-period average (P25-P27) has reached 2,713 units, up 8.6% from the P23-P25 average. The trend has now been sustained for over 25 periods without plateauing.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend, with the 3-period average reaches 2,712 units (P26-P28), a significant increase from the previous baseline. While Period 28 saw a slight dip to 2,643 from Period 27's peak of 2,890, the overall trend is aggressively upward. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts during this growth phase, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to 3,000 units. This value accounts for the current 3-period average (~2,712) plus a growth buffer to counteract the backend ordering cap which has historically lagged the demand surge. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility without over-penalizing for the long-term trend shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P28 demand (2,643) and P27 demand (2,890) confirm a high-volume regime. The 3-period moving average (P26-P28) is ~2,712 units, representing a 9% increase over the P23-P25 average (2,498). Total growth since Period 1 remains parabolic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10962.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a roughly parabolic growth trend. Period 29 demand was 2,814, and the 3-period moving average (P27-P29) has reached approximately 2,782 units, which is a 5% increase over the previous rolling average (P24-P26: 2,646). Although Period 28 saw a slight dip, the strong recovery in Period 29 confirms the upward trajectory persists. To ensure the OR backend's order cap (which uses historical stats) doesn't restrict the order size below actual demand needs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a forward-looking buffer. I'll estimate the next period's demand at approximately 3,000 units given the growth rate, and use a high sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility observed in the recent high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic: The 3-period moving average (P27-P29) is ~2,782 units, up 5% from the P24-P26 average. Despite minor fluctuations (P28), demand has effectively tripled since Period 10 and increased 30-fold since Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11070.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its long-term parabolic growth trend. Period 30 demand was 2,873, and the 3-period moving average (P28-P30) is approximately 2,777 units. Over the last 10 periods, demand has consistently stayed within the 2,500-2,900 range, showing sustained high volume far above the initial baseline. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend targets the 80th percentile of the demand distribution. Because demand has been increasing significantly, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~2,770) while providing enough variance to handle the 2,800+ peaks. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained in the >2,700 units/period regime: The 3-period moving average (P28-P30) is 2,777 units, and demand has stayed above 2,600 units for 6 out of the last 7 periods, confirming the plateau is still slightly rising or stabilizing at this high level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11500.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching a new peak of 3,046 units in Period 31, which led to a stockout (ending inventory=0). The 3-period moving average (P29-P31) has risen to ~2,911 units, a 5% increase over the previous P28-P30 average of 2,777. Given a 19-period history of parabolic growth, the forecast must stay ahead of the trailing mean to avoid further stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent based on all 31 concluded periods. To capture the current growth and mitigate the recurring stockout risk, I am using a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current high-demand regime, while applying an explicit lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 31 demand (3,046) is a new peak. The 3-period moving average (P29-P31) has reached 2,911 units, maintaining the sustained upward trend observed since Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12012.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow an aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand (P32) at 3,005 and the previous peak (P31) at 3,046. The 3-period moving average (P30-P32) is approximately 2,975 units, reflecting a 7% increase over the previous 3-period average (P27-P29: 2,782). Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. To ensure the OR backend places an order sufficient to cover this growth and provide a safety buffer against the recurrent stockouts (P31), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,200 (approx. 7% above the recent 3-period average) and using a recent_N sigma_hat to capture the high volatility inherent in this parabolic growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: The 3-period moving average (P30-P32) has reached 2,975 units, a 7% increase over the P27-P29 average. Demand has now consistently stayed above 2,600 units for 10 consecutive periods, confirming a high-volume, still-escalating regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, with Period 33 demand reaching 3,391 units. This resulted in a stockout (sold 3,336 vs demand 3,391). The 3-period moving average (P31-P33) is now 3,147 units, up from 2,975 in the previous window (+5.8%). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To address the persistent stockouts caused by demand outstripping the OR backend's internal caps and moving averages, I am using the 'explicit' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am forecasting mu_hat at 3,500 units for the next period (Review+Lead) to stay ahead of the parabolic growth, and set sigma_hat to 350 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the high volatility observed in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and parabolic: Period 33 demand (3,391) is a new peak, 11% higher than Period 31. The 3-period moving average (P31-P33) has climbed to 3,147 units, maintaining the sustained growth trend now spanning 32 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow an aggressive upward trend, with Period 33 hitting a peak of 3,391 and Period 34 following closely at 3,368. The current demand regime is significantly higher than the long-term historical mean. Analysis of the most recent data (P32-P34) shows an average demand of approximately 3,255 units. Given the persistent growth and occasional stockouts (P31, P33) caused by supply-side caps, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3,600 units to anticipate further immediate growth and provide a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 300 to account for recent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and reached a >3,300 units/period regime as of Period 33. The 3-period moving average (P32-P34) is 3,255, up from 3,147 (+3.4%) in the previous window. This upward trend has persisted for over 30 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12557.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a massive, sustained upward trend, currently operating in a >3,200 units/period regime. Period 33 peaked at 3,391, and while Periods 34-35 showed a slight cooling (3,368 and 3,282), the 3-period moving average (P33-P35) remains high at ~3,347 units. The lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the parabolic nature of the growth observed over 35 periods, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set slightly above the recent average to account for continued potential growth and to ensure the backend cap (which has historically lagged) does not restrict necessary replenishment. I'll set mu_hat to 3,450 (covering current demand + small growth margin) and use a recent_N sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility during this high-volume stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Despite a slight dip in P35 (3,282), the 3-period average (P33-P35) is 3,347, sustaining the >3,300 regime established in Period 33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13637.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 36 recording 3,448 units. The 3-period moving average (P34-P36) is approximately 3,366 units, confirming the >3,300 units/period regime identified in Period 33. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and satisfying demand within the decision window. However, the OR backend's order cap frequently lags this parabolic growth. To ensure the backend places an order sufficient to cover the escalating demand and potential stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most current high-volume regime. This provides a demand forecast across the (L+1) period window of roughly 3,366 units per period. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect current volatility. L remains at the default (promised) value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a >3,300 units/period range: The 3-period moving average (P34-P36) is 3,366 units, maintaining the growth trend established in Period 33 (+12% from the P30-P32 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $13744.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive, multi-period upward trend. Period 37 demand reached a new peak of 3,748 units, resulting in a stockout. The 3-period moving average (P35-P37) is approximately 3,493 units, which is a 4% increase over the P34-P36 average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded messages. Given the sustained growth and recurring stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4,000 to account for demand potentially exceeding the current 3-period average, ensuring the OR backend's order cap does not prematurely restrict inventory. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to reflect the higher volatility (approx 200-300 units) observed in this high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 37 demand (3,748) is a new peak, and the 3-period average (P35-P37) has reached ~3,493 units. This sustains a 36-period upward trend with frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15392.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive parabolic climb, with Period 38 hitting a new peak of 3,929 units. The 3-period moving average (P36-P38) is currently 3,708, which is a significant jump from the previous window. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now will arrive and be available for this period's demand (Resolution Phase 2 & 3). To prevent stockouts in this high-growth regime, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 4,200, which is approximately 7% above the last observed demand, anticipating the continued upward trend. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. This aggressive forecasting is necessary because the backend ordering logic is capped, and previous periods show that underestimating during a surge leads to immediate stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and parabolic: Period 38 demand (3,929) is a new peak, and the 3-period average (P36-P38) has reached 3,708 units, a 6% increase over the P35-P37 average. This sustained 37-period growth trend shows no signs of plateauing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16655.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its long-term parabolic growth trend. Period 39 demand reached a new peak of 4,212 units, a 7% increase over Period 38 (3,929) and a 12% increase over Period 37 (3,748). The 3-period moving average (P37-P39) is now 3,963 units. Since demand has consistently increased for nearly 40 periods, often outstripping the OR backend's inventory caps, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most current, high-volume regime while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the forecast is anchored to the most recent behavior rather than being pulled down by lower historical demand. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (including Period 39), so the default 'L' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and parabolic: Period 39 demand (4,212) is a new peak, and the 3-period average (P37-P39) has reached 3,963 units, a 6.8% increase over the P36-P38 average (3,708). The trend has persisted for 38 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16640.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive parabolic trend, reaching a new peak of 4,461 in Period 40. The 3-period moving average (P38-P40) is ~4,200, which is a 6% increase from the previous (P37-P39) window. We observed a stockout in Period 40 (only 4,160 units available vs 4,461 demand), confirming that our inventory levels are still lagging the demand surge. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture the current trajectory and ensure the base_stock (which is capped by the OR backend) is high enough to prevent further stockouts, I will use an explicit forecast. Calculation: (1+L) * forecast. With L=0, and recent growth suggesting the next demand point will likely exceed 4,700 (based on a ~6% WoW growth on 4,461), I will set mu_hat to 4,800. Sigma_hat is set to 400 to account for the increasing volatility observed at these high volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic and uncurbed: Period 40 demand (4,461) is a new peak, 6% higher than Period 39. The 3-period average (P38-P40) has reached ~4,200. Stockouts occurred in Period 40 due to backend caps lagging demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15693.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a powerful upward parabolic trend that has persisted for nearly 40 periods. In Period 41, demand was 4,166, which is a slight softening from the peak of 4,461 in Period 40 but still extremely high. The trailing 3-period average (P39-P41) is 4,280 units. Because the OR backend uses a capped policy that frequently lags this type of aggressive growth (evidenced by the stockout in P40), I must set mu_hat explicitly to provide a forward-looking forecast that accounts for continued expansion. Setting mu_hat to 4,800 units provides a ~12% buffer over the current 3-period average to prevent stockouts as we enter the final 10 periods of the game. L remains 0 based on consistent historical data. Sigma_hat is set to 450 (approx 10% of mean) to handle the significant volatility seen in recent periods (e.g., 4,461 to 4,166).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains parabolic: Period 40 reached a new peak of 4,461. While Period 41 dipped to 4,166, the 3-period average (P39-P41) of 4,280 is still ~34% higher than the P33-P35 average (3,147), confirming the long-term trend is still dominant despite short-term fluctuations.

Period 41 demand was 4,166 and Period 42 was 4,040, both lower than the peak of 4,461 in Period 40. The 3-period moving average (P40-P42) is now 4,222 units. To prevent over-ordering as the growth potentially peaks, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use a slightly longer window (recent_N=5) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining a high service level. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P38-P42) to better reflect the current high-volume yet fluctuating regime, as using the entire history would severely underestimate demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth shows signs of plateauing or stabilizing in the 4,000-4,500 units/period range after a 40-period parabolic climb. P41 and P42 demand were both lower than the P40 peak.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term parabolic growth trend over 40 periods, though it appears to be stabilizing or slightly plateauing in the 4,000-4,500 units/period range recently. Period 43 demand was 3,950, which is consistent with the last few periods (P42: 4,040, P41: 4,166) being slightly below the P40 peak of 4,461. The current on-hand inventory is 381. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the possible plateau, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent behavior (P40-P43 average: 4,154), which remains significantly higher than the overall historical mean but reflects the slight deceleration from the peak. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend uses a target service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)), which my parameters will support by centering the base stock on the recent high-volume regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established high-volume regime. Period 44 saw a demand of 4,444 units, which is a significant increase from the 3,950-4,040 range observed in periods 42-43 and matches the previous peak of 4,461 in Period 40. This suggests that the 'plateau' identified in Carry-over Insight Period 43 was either temporary or that demand is still rising within a wider bracket (4,000-4,500). The current on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 44 (4,342 units sold vs 4,444 demand). To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand spike, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This aligns the forecast with the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44), where demand averaged ~4,212 units, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently high to cover the current volatile demand peak while the OR backend cap provides a safety mechanism. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-volatility peak regime: Period 44 demand (4,444) returned to near-peak levels (P40: 4,461) after a brief two-period dip, confirming the 4,000-4,500 units/period regime remains active.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate within a high-volume regime of 4,000\u20134,500 units per period. Period 45 demand (4,364) is consistent with the return to peak levels observed in Period 44 (4,444). The 3-period moving average (P43-P45) is approximately 4,253 units. Given that the lead time remains 0, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this current high-plateau behavior while remaining responsive to the persistent risk of stockouts (as seen in P44 where we started with 4,342 against a demand of 4,444). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed in this peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed in the 4,000-4,500 units/period range: 3-period average (P43-P45) is 4,253 units, sustaining the plateau reached around Period 40.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime between 4,000 and 4,600 units per period following a long parabolic climb. Period 46 demand was 4,530, continuing this trend. Although recently volatile, the 3-period average (P44-P46) is roughly 4,446 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts (as seen in P46) while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the shift from Period 40 onwards) to capture the current high-plateau mean. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=7 to capture the increased volatility in this peak regime. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that accounts for the high demand while utilizing the 0-period lead time for rapid replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a 4,000-4,600 units/period range: 3-period average (P44-P46) is ~4,446 units, with Period 46 reaching a near-peak of 4,530.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17884.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime between 4,000 and 4,600 units per period following a 40-period growth phase. Recent demands (P44: 4,444, P45: 4,364, P46: 4,530, P47: 4,595) show a slight but consistent upward creep within this plateau, with the last two periods exceeding 4,500 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 0, the ordered quantity must cover the immediate period's demand. To prevent stockouts seen in P46 and P47, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) which averages ~4,496 units, ensuring the order captures the current top-end demand of the plateau. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the narrowed variance of the current stable regime compared to the overall historical parabolic climb. Lead time L remains at 'default' (0) as all orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has slightly shifted its 4,000-4,500 plateau ceiling, with Period 46 and 47 both exceeding 4,500 units (avg ~4,563), suggesting a final stabilization at the 4,500-4,600 level.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its long-term parabolic growth, reaching a new peak of 4,776 units in Period 48. Although there were signs of a plateau between periods 41-45, the last three periods (P46-P48) have shown demand consistently exceeding 4,500 units and trending upward (4,530, 4,595, 4,776). The 3-period moving average is now approximately 4,634 units. To ensure sufficient inventory and counteract the inherent ordering cap of the OR backend which often lags such aggressive growth, I am setting mu_hat's method to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this most recent escalation. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the heightened volatility associated with the current high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed acceleration at Period 46: After a brief plateau (P41-P45), demand has risen for three consecutive periods (4,530 to 4,776), establishing a new high-volume regime above 4,600 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19068.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a persistent and aggressive upward trend for nearly 50 periods. Period 49 demand reached 5,087 units, the highest recorded value so far, representing a 6.5% increase over Period 48. The 3-period moving average (P47-P49) is approximately 4,819 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 3-period average (P44-P46) of 4,446 units. Stockouts have occurred in the last four consecutive periods (P46-P49) because the supply-side backend caps are lagging behind this parabolic growth. To minimize lost sales and account for the established 5,000+ unit regime, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent level (avg ~4,819). However, because demand is still trending upward and consistently hitting the order cap, I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat value to increase the base stock level and force the order closer to the ceiling, providing a buffer against the next expected peak in Period 50. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth resumed acceleration at Period 46 and has reached a new high-volume regime exceeding 5,000 units as of Period 49. The 3-period average (P47-P49) is ~4,819 units, confirming the parabolic trend is still active and resulting in four consecutive periods of stockouts due into Period 50.
