Calculating the average of these samples gives approximately 111 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My ordering strategy needs to cover (L+1) periods to account for the time it takes for an order placed now to arrive (Period 1 + 4 = Period 5 arrival, covering demand for Period 5) and the demand occurring during the wait. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. To protect against stockouts during the lead time and establish a baseline stock, I will target covering 5 periods of demand (avg 111 * 5 = 555 units).

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the order from Period 1 is in-transit (promised lead time is 4 periods).

I need to maintain a pipeline that covers demand until that arrival and beyond. My target pipeline should cover (L+1) periods + buffer. With L=4, targeting roughly 6-7 periods (~700-750 units) is safe to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.
