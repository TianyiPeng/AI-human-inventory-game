(b) Demand regime: Historical samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] suggest a mean demand of approximately 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation around 17. (c) Lead time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. No history yet. (d) Inventory & pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. (e) Order logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods) because an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 3, but visible to me at P4. To minimize stockouts immediately, I aim to reach a target inventory level that covers roughly 3 periods of demand plus a small safety stock. Mean (111.4) * 3 periods = ~334 units. Given zero starting stock, I will order 350 units to establish a baseline pipeline and account for the high-end variance (138) seen in history.",

Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and since demand is resolved after arrivals, the Period 1 demand of 91 resulted in 91 lost sales. Historical samples suggest an average demand of approximately 111.4 units ([112, 97, 116, 138, 94]). The Period 1 demand of 91 is slightly lower than the historical average but within a normal range. To determine the order for Period 2, I calculate the target inventory for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Total expected demand for 3 periods is ~335 units. I currently have 350 units in transit (ordered P1, expected P3). This shipment covers the demand for Period 3 and Period 4's start. However, because on-hand is currently 0 and the P1 order won't arrive until P3, I will likely stock out in Period 2 as well. Since I already have a significant pipeline (350 units) relative to the 111 average demand, and adding more now would only arrive in Period 4 (potentially leading to high holding costs if demand stays at ~111), I will place a smaller supplemental order to maintain a steady flow while waiting to confirm the actual lead time.",

Total arrivals in Period 4 were 600 units (350+100+150), which covered the accumulated backlogged demand from P1-P3 plus P4's demand (Total demand P1-P4 = 91+246+285+437 = 1059).
