Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The provided training data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] shows a mean demand of 111.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 17. The demand is relatively stable but fluctuates within a range of 94 to 138. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: As the current date is Period 1 and no specific external calendar dates (like holidays or events) are provided, the forecast relies on the internal distribution of the historical data. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: The last data point was 94, which is at the lower end of the historical range, following a peak of 138. There is no clear sustained upward or downward trend yet. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the lack of specific calendar triggers and the mean-reverting nature of the past 5 periods, the forecast aims for a value close to the historical average (111) but slightly adjusted toward the recent mean to account for the most recent observation. I will predict a demand of 110.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The training data shows a mean of 111.4 units (range 94-138). 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: No specific dates provided, only 'Period 2'. 3. Recent Trend: Period 1 demand (91) is slightly below the training average and matches the lower end of the historical range (94). 4. Final Forecast Logic: The demand for 'chips(Regular)' appears relatively stable with moderate variance. Since Period 1 (91) is close to the lower bound of the previous observations, and no external event or trend is indicated, I expect a slight mean reversion towards the historical average of 111, while weighting the most recent observation. A forecast of 105 balances the recent dip with the historical mean.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The initial training data showed a mean demand of approximately 111 units with a range of 94-138. Period 1 followed this baseline at 91 units. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: Period 2 shows a massive spike to 246 units. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', this suggests a major event (e.g., a holiday, sporting event, or significant promotion) occurred during Period 2. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: The jump from 91 to 246 is a 170% increase. Without specific calendar labels, I must determine if this is a one-time spike or a shift. Usually, snack demand spikes for events and then regresses, but often stays slightly elevated if it's the start of a peak season. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Period 3 is likely to see a regression toward the mean as the event peak subsides, but I will forecast slightly above the historical baseline (111) to account for potential residual demand or a multi-period event, settling on 135.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern: Initial demand was low (~91-112). 2. Recent Trend: There has been a significant surge in demand starting from Period 2 (246 units) and continuing into Period 3 (285 units). This indicates a strong upward momentum or a demand regime shift compared to the training data average (~111). 3. Forecast Logic: Given the sharp increase in the last two periods (from 91 to 246 to 285), the demand is currently in a growth phase. I expect the demand to continue this upward trajectory or stabilize at the new higher level. Predicting 310 units based on the recent growth rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1700.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for 'chips(Regular)' showed a stable demand around 111 units. However, the observed test data from Period 1 to Period 4 shows a sharp and sustained upward trend: 91, 246, 285, and 437. This indicates a significant demand regime shift or a powerful seasonal/promotional trend. The demand has increased by an average of approximately 115 units per period over the last three observations. Given the momentum from Period 3 (285) to Period 4 (437), which is a 53% increase, a continued but slightly moderated increase is expected for Period 5. I will forecast a value that continues the upward trajectory while accounting for potential variance in the growth rate.

Carry-over insight: Significant upward demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: Demand increased from an initial baseline of ~100 to an average of 322 units over the last 3 periods (+222%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 2. The initial baseline (Period 1 and training data) was around 100 units. Since Period 2, demand has scaled rapidly: 246, 285, 437, and 448. The most recent two periods (4 and 5) show a stabilization or slight slowing of the growth rate at a much higher level (average ~442). Given the strong upward trend that appears to be transitioning into a new high-demand plateau, I will forecast a slight increase to 465, accounting for the continued positive momentum while acknowledging the recent stabilization near the 450 mark.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 4-5 average (442) represents a 55% increase over the Period 2-3 average (265), establishing a new high-demand baseline for 'chips(Regular)'.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a very strong, sustained upward trend for chips(Regular). The demand has grown significantly: Period 1 (91), Period 2-3 average (~265), Period 4-5 average (~442), and Period 6 (587). This represents a consistent growth pattern rather than a stable regime. The jump from P5 to P6 (+139 units) suggests the momentum is still accelerating. Given the previous 'Carry-Over Insights' confirming a regime shift to ~442, the P6 value of 587 indicates we have not yet hit a plateau. I will project a continued increase but temper the growth slightly to account for potential variance, forecasting a value higher than P6 but in line with the established trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward trend continues: Period 6 demand (587) represents a 32% increase over the Period 4-5 average (442), indicating the previously identified high-demand baseline is still rising.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a strong and consistent upward trend. Starting from Period 1 (91 units), demand has grown significantly: Period 2-3 averaged ~265, Period 4-5 averaged ~442, and Period 6-7 averaged ~612. The absolute increases between recent periods are +139 (P5 to P6) and +50 (P6 to P7). While the growth rate is slowing slightly compared to the initial explosive shift, the trend remains positive. Given the momentum and the Carry-over Insights confirming a sustained regime shift, I expect the demand to continue its upward trajectory. Applying a growth factor similar to the most recent period (+50 units) to the Period 7 demand (637) suggests a forecast in the high 600s.

Carry-over insight: Continued upward growth: Period 6-7 average (612) shows a 38% increase over the Period 4-5 baseline (442), confirming the demand regime is still scaling upward.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent and significant upward trend since Period 2. Analyzing the historical test data: Period 2 (246), Period 3 (285), Period 4 (437), Period 5 (448), Period 6 (587), Period 7 (637), and Period 8 (776). The recent growth from Period 6 to 8 shows a steep incline: +50 units (P7) followed by +139 units (P8). The average demand over the last three periods (P6-P8) is 666.7 units. Given the momentum and the significant jump in the most recent period (+21% from P7 to P8), I am projecting a continued increase for Period 9. The step-wise nature of the increases suggests the product is in a high-growth phase, likely driven by seasonal factors or market expansion not explicitly detailed but evident in the data.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive upward trend confirmed: Period 6-8 average (666) is 50% higher than the Period 4-5 baseline (442). Demand is increasing by approximately 75-100 units per period over the last 3 observations.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong, accelerating upward trend. Historical data from the training phase (avg ~111) has been completely superseded by a consistent growth pattern in the test phase. Since Period 2, demand has increased in every single period. Analysis of the growth increments shows a repeating pattern of large jumps followed by smaller consolidations: P5-P6 (+139), P6-P7 (+50), P7-P8 (+139), P8-P9 (+187). The most recent jump (P8 to P9) is the largest yet. To forecast Period 10, I apply a growth factor consistent with recent performance. The average growth over the last three periods (P7-P9) is approximately 163 units per period. Adding this to the Period 9 demand (963 + 163) suggests a value around 1126. Given the momentum and the tendency for even-numbered periods to show strong gains in the recent 'step' pattern, a forecast of 1115 is selected.

Carry-over insight: Growth acceleration confirmed: The average demand increase has risen from ~140 units per period (Periods 4-8) to 187 units in the most recent observation (Period 9), indicating the upward trend is gaining momentum rather than stabilizing.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend, moving from an initial baseline of ~91 units to a peak of 963 units in Period 9. The observed growth pattern often involves significant jumps followed by smaller adjustments. Period 10 (863) recorded the first decline in the test phase, dropping ~10% from the Period 9 peak. This suggests a potential stabilization or a temporary correction after the aggressive acceleration noted in previous periods. Despite the recent drop, the three-period moving average (P8-P10) is 867 units, and the overall trajectory remains positive. For Period 11, I anticipate a modest recovery or stabilization above the Period 10 level as the market adjusts to the new high-demand regime, though the momentum has clearly slowed compared to the P7-P9 surge.

Carry-over insight: Growth deceleration detected: Period 10 (863) saw a 10.4% decline from Period 9, the first drop in the test series. While the long-term trend remains upward, the growth rate from P8 to P10 (+87 units) is significantly lower than the P6 to P8 growth (+189 units), suggesting the aggressive expansion phase is cooling.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a long-term aggressive upward trend for 'chips(Regular)'. After a temporary dip in Period 10 (863 units), demand surged to a new series high in Period 11 (1136 units), a 31.6% increase. This surge invalidates the 'cooling' hypothesis from the previous period and suggests the momentum has resumed or reached a new level of volatility. The average of the last three periods (P9-P11) is 987 units. Given the strong recovery from the P10 dip and the overall trajectory, I expect demand to remain at this elevated level or slightly increase, though I will moderate the forecast to account for potential variance seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive growth resumed: Period 11 (1136) marks a new peak and confirms the Period 10 decline was a temporary outlier rather than a trend reversal. Average demand over the last 3 periods (987) is 27% higher than the Period 6-8 average (776).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a powerful upward trend. After a temporary correction in Period 10 (863), the demand surged to 1136 in Period 11 and continued to a new peak of 1221 in Period 12. Analysis of the recent growth shows an average increase of approximately 111 units per period over the last four periods (P8 to P12) and 86 units per period over the last three periods (P9 to P12). The transition from P11 to P12 showed an increase of 85 units. Given the consistency of this momentum, I am forecasting a continued upward trajectory for Period 13, targeting a similar growth increment of approximately 100 units above the previous period.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth trajectory: Demand has increased by an average of ~111 units per period over the last 4 observations (P8-P12), reaching a new peak baseline above 1200 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant upward trajectory, though the rate of growth is showing signs of stabilization. After the aggressive surge seen between Period 10 and Period 11 (+273 units), the last two periods have shown more moderate increases: Period 12 (+85 units) and Period 13 (+25 units). The current average over the last three periods (P11-P13) is 1201 units. While the exponential growth phase appears to be cooling, the trend remains positive. A conservative forecast is applied to account for the decelerating growth velocity (the 'flattening' of the curve), projecting a modest increase of approximately 30-40 units over the previous observation, consistent with the deceleration from P12 to P13.

Carry-over insight: Growth velocity deceleration confirmed: While demand remains at record highs, the period-over-period growth rate has slowed from an average of ~150 units (P6-P11) to an average of 55 units over the last two observations (P12-P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has exhibited a significant and sustained upward trend since Period 2. Analyzing the most recent data, the growth rate is clearly decelerating: the increases over the last three periods were +85 (P11 to P12), +25 (P12 to P13), and +19 (P13 to P14). This suggests the demand is approaching a plateau or ceiling near the 1250-1300 range. While the trend remains positive, the velocity has dropped from an average of ~150 units per period in the middle phase to approximately +22 units per period over the last two observations. Following this trajectory of diminishing marginal growth, I forecast a slight increase for Period 15.

Carry-over insight: Growth stabilization confirmed: Period-over-period growth has slowed significantly from triple digits (P6-P11) to an average increase of only 22 units over the last two periods (P13-P14), suggesting demand is reaching a local ceiling near 1275 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term aggressive upward trend. Recent insights suggested a stabilization around 1275 units (Periods 13-14), but Period 15 saw a significant surge to 1507 units (+19% WoW). This jump breaks the previous stabilization hypothesis and suggests a new growth spurt or a high-demand event. While the overall trend is strongly positive, the magnitude of the Period 15 spike is high relative to the recent plateau. I will forecast a slight continuation/consolidation of this new level, anticipating demand to remain high but potentially regress slightly toward the recent high-growth mean as the immediate spike stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth re-acceleration: Period 15 (1507) broke the prior stabilization ceiling of ~1275, representing a 19% increase and indicating a shift to a new, higher demand regime above 1400 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent and aggressive upward trajectory since Period 2. Historically, we saw a period of stabilization around Period 12-14 (near 1250 units), followed by a significant regime shift starting in Period 15, where demand jumped to over 1500 units. The last two observations (Period 15: 1507, Period 16: 1547) show that the growth is continuing but at a slightly more moderate pace compared to the initial jump (+40 units or 2.6%). Given the strong upward trend and the recent establishment of a new high-demand baseline, I expect a further increase. Applying the most recent incremental growth (+40 units) to Period 16, the forecast for Period 17 is 1587.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Average demand for P15-P16 (1527) is 23% higher than the P12-P14 baseline (1244), establishing a new support level above 1500 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trajectory. Recent demand points (P15: 1507, P16: 1547, P17: 1724) confirm the shift into a higher regime above 1500 units. The jump from P16 to P17 (+177 units) indicates that growth velocity remains high after a brief moderation in P16. Over the last three periods, the average growth has been approximately 108 units per period. Given the sustained momentum and lack of evidence for a ceiling in this new regime, the forecast for Period 18 anticipates a continued increase, adding approximately 100 units to the P17 baseline.

Carry-over insight: Growth acceleration confirmed: Period 17 (1724) represents a 11.4% increase over Period 16, indicating the demand regime is scaling faster than the P13-P14 stabilization phase and establishing a new trajectory targeting 1800+ units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a consistent and aggressive upward trend with periodic step-ups into new regimes. Recently, the demand shifted from a stabilization period around 1250 (P12-P14) to a new high-demand regime starting in P15. Over the last four periods (P15-P18), demand has grown from 1507 to 1802, representing an average increase of approximately 98 units per period. The most recent observations (P17-P18) show a continued climb, with P18 reaching a new peak of 1802 (+78 units from P17). Given this sustained momentum, I anticipate a further increase for Period 19, following the trajectory established in the last two periods (~80-100 unit growth).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth regime confirmed: Period 16-18 average (1691) is 36% higher than the Period 12-14 baseline (1244). Demand continues to scale with an average period-over-period increase of 98 units over the last four observations.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a strong, compounding upward trend. (1) Historical Pattern: Demand has grown from an initial ~100 to over 2000 units in 19 periods. (2) Calendar/Seasonal: No specific dates are provided, but the product category (chips) often experiences sustained growth during peak marketing or seasonal snack periods. (3) Recent Trend: Demand increased significantly from 1802 in P18 to 2075 in P19 (+273 units or +15%). This exceeds the growth seen in the previous two periods (+177 and +78). (4) Final Forecast Logic: Given the current growth velocity and the carry-over insight noting a high-growth regime (avg ~98 units increase, which has recently accelerated to ~150-200+ units), I expect a continued increase. I will forecast a growth of approximately 10% on the latest observation to account for the accelerating momentum while remaining slightly conservative compared to the last period's 15% jump.

Carry-over insight: Growth momentum accelerating: Demand jumped 15% in Period 19 (2075 units), well above the previous 3-period average increase of 109 units, establishing a new demand floor above 2000.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong long-term upward trajectory, though it currently displays a pattern of 'spike and consolidation.' Similar to the dip observed in Period 10 (which followed a period of rapid growth and was immediately succeeded by a significant jump), Period 20 shows a slight decline (-102 units) after the record peak in Period 19. Historical patterns suggest this is a temporary stabilization rather than a trend reversal. The average demand over the last three periods (P18-P20) is 1950 units. Given the historical growth rate and the behavior seen after the P10 dip, I expect demand to rebound and continue its climb, likely moving back toward the 2100-2200 range as the new baseline establishes itself.

Carry-over insight: Growth consolidation pattern detected: Period 20 (1973) shows a 4.9% decline following a 15% spike in P19, mirroring the behavior seen in Period 10. Despite this, the P18-P20 average (1950) is 15% higher than the P15-P17 average (1593), confirming the upward momentum remains intact.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by aggressive growth spurts followed by short consolidation phases. Recently, Period 19 saw a major spike to 2075, which was followed by a 4.9% dip in Period 20 (1973) and a stabilization in Period 21 (1983). This 'step-and-pause' behavior mirrors the pattern observed between Periods 9 and 11, where a dip from 963 to 863 was immediately followed by a jump to 1136. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the average demand is 1851, and the average period-over-period growth since P15 is approximately 80 units. Given the recent two-period consolidation (P20-P21) around the 1980 mark, demand is expected to resume its upward movement. A forecast of 2100 reflects a conservative resumption of the growth trend, moving past the previous peak of 2075.

Carry-over insight: Growth consolidation floor confirmed: Periods 20 and 21 have established a new demand floor around 1980 units (+15% above the P16-P18 average), suggesting the trend is preparing for a new upward leg.

Predicted demand: 2100 units

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trajectory. After a brief consolidation phase in Periods 20 and 21 (averaging ~1978 units), Period 22 saw a significant breakout to a new peak of 2221 units (+12% increase from the consolidation floor). Historically, such breakouts (like P14 to P15) often lead to a short period of moderate growth or slight stabilization before the next major leg up. The average growth rate over the last five periods is approximately 99 units per period. Given the strength of the Period 22 jump, I expect demand to follow through with continued but slightly more measured growth as the market absorbs the new price/demand level, targeting a forecast in the 2300-2350 range.

Carry-over insight: Upward breakout confirmed: Period 22 (2221) ended the consolidation phase observed in Periods 20-21, establishing a new demand ceiling 7% higher than the previous peak in Period 19.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Over the last five periods (P18-P23), the demand has grown from 1802 to 2326, an average increase of approximately 105 units per period. Specifically, the last two periods (P22 and P23) showed a significant breakout from the P20-P21 consolidation floor (~1980 units), with increases of +238 and +105 respectively. Historical patterns for this SKU suggest that after an initial breakout jump, the trend tends to sustain growth for 2-3 periods before another consolidation phase. Given the current momentum and the 3-period average growth of 117 units, I expect Period 24 to reach a new peak near 2450.

Carry-over insight: Growth momentum sustained: Demand has increased by an average of 117 units over the last 3 periods (P21-P23), confirming the breakout from the 2000-unit resistance level identified in Period 21.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory. Following the consolidation phase observed in Periods 20-21 (~1980 units), the demand broke out significantly. Recent observations show a consistent increase: Period 22 (+238), Period 23 (+105), and Period 24 (+240). The average period-over-period growth over the last three periods is approximately +194 units. Period 24 (2566) represents a new peak and a 10.3% increase from Period 23. Given this momentum, a forecast for Period 25 should account for the average growth rate of the recent breakout phase. Applying an increase of approximately 190-200 units to the Period 24 baseline suggests a forecast in the 2750-2770 range.

Carry-over insight: Growth acceleration confirmed: Average period-over-period increase has risen to 194 units over the last 3 periods (P22-P24), compared to the 117-unit growth rate identified in Period 24. This confirms a new aggressive scaling phase with a baseline now exceeding 2500 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established upward trajectory. Analyzing the recent periods, there is a recurring pattern of a significant jump followed by a smaller incremental gain: P22-P23 saw a jump of 238 then 105; P24-P25 saw a jump of 240 then 38. This suggests that Period 26 is likely to experience another significant step upward or a continuation of the aggressive scaling phase identified in previous insights. The average period-over-period growth since P21 is approximately 155 units. Given the jump to the 2600 level in P25, and applying the recent growth momentum (averaging ~140-160 units per period over the last five observations), the forecast targets the next logical level in the trend.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive scaling sustained: Average demand for P23-P25 (2499) is 15% higher than the P20-P22 average (2059), confirming that the demand regime has successfully transitioned from the 2000-unit ceiling to a new baseline exceeding 2500 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent and significant upward trend since Period 2. Most recently, the demand has moved into a new regime above 2500 units. A review of the last five periods (P22-P26) shows demand of 2221, 2326, 2566, 2604, and 2645. This represents a clear scaling pattern. While the growth rate between P24-P26 has slightly moderated compared to the sharp jump from P23 to P24, the absolute values continue to set new peaks. The average growth over the last three periods (P24-P26) is approximately 106 units per period. However, the last two periods (P25 and P26) show a much tighter consolidation/growth of ~40 units. Given the historical pattern of periodic consolidation followed by continued scaling, I expect Period 27 to continue this upward trajectory, albeit potentially at the more tempered rate observed in the most recent two observations to remain conservative.

Carry-over insight: Growth stabilization in high-demand regime: Demand growth has slowed from a triple-digit average to a double-digit average (+41 units) over the last two periods (P25-P26), maintaining a new baseline above 2600 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive long-term upward trajectory. Historically, the product exhibits a pattern of sharp 'breakout' periods (increases of ~240 units) followed by short phases of consolidation (increases of ~40 units). After a period of relative stability in P25 and P26 (avg +40 units), Period 27 showed a new breakout with a 245-unit jump (9.3% increase). Given that breakouts in this series often span 1-2 periods before a pullback or consolidation occurs (as seen in P11-12, P15-16, and P18-19), I expect Period 28 to continue scaling or consolidate at the new high. Following the logic of previous breakout legs, a moderate continued increase is projected.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed: Period 27 (2890) represents a 9.3% jump over the P25-P26 average (2624), signaling a shift from the previous consolidation phase to a new high-demand baseline approaching 3000 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, though it exhibits a repeating pattern of sharp spikes followed by immediate corrections. Specifically, Period 27 peaked at 2890 before dropping to 2643 in Period 28. This mirrors previous behavior seen in Periods 9-10 (963 to 863) and Periods 19-20 (2075 to 1973), where a spike was followed by a 5-10% correction and then a return to steady growth. The current demand level (2643) aligns with the high-demand baseline established in Periods 25-26 (avg 2624). I forecast Period 29 to resume modest growth from this consolidated base, targeting approximately 2725 units.

Carry-over insight: Growth consolidation confirmed: Period 28 (2643) represents a 8.5% correction following the Period 27 spike, establishing a firm support level near 2650 units and mirroring the spike-and-correction cycles observed in Periods 10 and 20.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) exhibits a clear long-term upward trend characterized by periodic 'spike and correction' cycles. Historically, corrections (seen at P10, P20, and P28) are followed by immediate recoveries that eventually surpass the previous peak. Following the 8.5% correction in P28 (2643), P29 showed a recovery to 2814 (+171 units). Based on the established growth trajectory which has averaged approximately 93 units per period over the last 10 observations, and the tendency for demand to target a new peak following a correction cycle, I expect P30 to continue this upward momentum. Given that the previous local peak was 2890 (P27), the forecast assumes demand will rise toward or slightly exceed that level as it resumes its scaling phase.

Carry-over insight: Resumption of growth cycle confirmed: Following the correction in Period 28, demand recovered by 6.5% in Period 29 (2814). This mirrors previous recovery patterns (P10-P11, P20-P22) where demand typically surpasses the pre-correction peak within 2-3 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a cyclical 'step-up and correct' growth pattern. After the correction in Period 28 (2643) following the Period 27 peak (2890), demand has shown two consecutive periods of recovery (P29: 2814, P30: 2873). Historical cycles (Periods 10-11 and 20-22) demonstrate that demand typically breaks its previous peak within 2-3 periods of a correction. Period 30 has reached 99.4% of the previous peak (2890). Given the sustained upward trajectory and the momentum observed in P29-P30, I expect Period 31 to break the previous resistance level and establish a new peak, consistent with the long-term trend of approximately 50-150 units of growth during recovery phases.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak imminent: Period 30 (2873) has recovered to nearly 100% of the pre-correction peak in Period 27 (2890), confirming the cyclical recovery pattern remains intact.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new expansion phase following the recovery from the Period 28 correction. Period 31 (3046) marks a significant breakout, successfully surpassing the previous peak of Period 27 (2890) and crossing the 3000-unit threshold. Historically, after clearing a previous resistance level and establishing a new peak (as seen in P11, P15, and P22), the product tends to maintain upward momentum for 2-3 periods before the next consolidation. The growth from P30 to P31 (+173 units) indicates accelerating momentum. My forecast projects a continuation of this breakout trend, applying a growth increment consistent with previous expansion cycles.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed: Period 31 (3046) has surpassed the previous Period 27 peak, ending the consolidation phase and establishing a new demand ceiling above 3000 units with a 3-period growth trend (P29-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term aggressive upward trajectory characterized by 'spike-correction-consolidation' cycles. Most recently, demand broke the 3000-unit ceiling in Period 31 (3046) followed by a minor 1.3% pullback in Period 32 (3005). This pattern mirrors previous cycles (e.g., Periods 20-21 and 25-26) where a brief period of consolidation or slight decline immediately preceded a return to growth. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), the average growth rate has been approximately 90 units per period. Given that P32 appears to be a consolidation point rather than a trend reversal, I expect demand to resume its upward movement toward a new local peak.

Carry-over insight: Growth consolidation above 3000 units: Period 32 (3005) confirms a new support level following the Period 31 breakout, with the 3-period average (P30-P32) of 2975 representing a 13% increase over the P25-P27 baseline (2624).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has exhibited a consistent long-term upward trajectory characterized by aggressive growth phases followed by brief consolidation or correction periods. Recent demand shows a significant breakout in Period 33 (3391 units), which is a 12.8% increase over Period 32 (3005) and the highest peak recorded to date. Historically, such spikes are often followed by a period of stabilization or a slight correction (as seen in P10, P20, and P28), but given the strength of the current momentum and the average period-over-period growth of ~150 units observed since Period 28, a continuation of the upward trend is likely. My forecast anticipates the demand will continue to scale, targeting the 3500-unit threshold while acknowledging the potential for a slight moderation in the growth rate following the high-intensity jump in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed: Period 33 (3391) represents a significant 12.8% jump over the previous baseline, establishing a new peak and suggesting the demand regime is scaling toward 3500+ units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend characterized by significant jumps followed by 1-2 periods of consolidation. Period 33 (3391) established a new peak, followed by a minor 0.6% contraction in Period 34 (3368). This pattern of 'spike and slight correction' mirrors previous cycles seen in Periods 20-21 and 31-32, which are typically followed by a resumption of the upward trajectory. Given that the demand has consolidated around the 3370 level, I expect Period 35 to break upward as it enters the next growth leg, targeting a range above 3500 units based on the historical step-increase magnitude.

Carry-over insight: Growth consolidation near 3350-3400 units: Following the 12.8% jump in Period 33, demand has held steady above 3350 for two periods, establishing a new support floor and signaling a pause before the next trend breakout.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established long-term upward trend, characterized by periodic spikes followed by brief consolidation or correction phases. Historically, these corrections (e.g., Periods 10, 20, 28) last 1-2 periods before demand resumes its growth and surpasses previous peaks. The recent demand sequence (P33: 3391, P34: 3368, P35: 3282) indicates a standard consolidation phase similar to the Period 28-30 cycle. In that cycle, Period 28 saw an 8.5% correction, followed by immediate recovery in Period 29. Period 35's 2.5% dip suggests the consolidation is cooling. Based on the pattern of previous recoveries, Period 36 is expected to see a return to growth, targeting the previous peak level of ~3400 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive long-term upward trajectory, characterized by a 'spike and consolidate' pattern. Recent demand (P33-P36) has established a new high-support zone between 3,280 and 3,450 units. Specifically, Period 36 (3448) shows a recovery from the slight dip in Period 35 (3282), mirroring previous cyclical behaviors where a correction is followed by a push toward a new peak. The average demand over the last four periods (P33-P36) is 3,372 units. Given the historical momentum where demand tends to breakout after 2-3 periods of consolidation (seen in P34-P35), Period 37 is expected to either test the upper bound of the current range or initiate a new upward leg. I am forecasting a continued moderate increase based on the 3-period moving average growth rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime consolidation confirmed: Periods 33-36 have established a firm support level above 3300 units, with a 4-period average of 3372 representing a 14% increase over the P29-P31 baseline (2911).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong, sustained upward trend characterized by periodic breakouts followed by short consolidation phases. Recently, demand stabilized in a range between 3300 and 3450 (Periods 33-36). Period 37 saw a significant jump to 3748 (+300 units or +8.7% over P36), signaling a breakout from the previous consolidation zone. Historically, such breakouts are followed by either a slight continuation or a stabilization at the new higher level. Given the momentum and the established pattern of reaching new peaks, the forecast for Period 38 anticipates continued growth towards the 3900-unit mark, aligning with the observed period-over-period growth trajectories seen in previous breakout phases (e.g., P15-P17, P22-P24).

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout detected at Period 37: Demand reached 3748, a 11% increase over the P33-P36 average (3372), signaling the end of the previous consolidation phase.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, long-term upward trend characterized by cyclical breakout phases followed by brief consolidation. Recent performance shows a significant shift from the previous support level of ~3372 (Periods 33-36) to a new growth leg. Period 37 (3748) and Period 38 (3929) represent a clear breakout, with a 4.8% increase in the most recent period. Historically, these breakout phases for this SKU often sustain for 2-3 periods before hitting a temporary resistance or correction. Given that Period 38 established a new peak, I expect Period 39 to continue this momentum, targeting the 4100-4200 range based on the average period-over-period growth rate of ~180-200 units observed during similar scaling phases (e.g., Periods 22-24).

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed: Period 37-38 average (3838) is 14% higher than the Period 33-36 baseline (3372), ending the previous consolidation phase and signaling a new target regime exceeding 4000 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a strong, non-linear upward trend characterized by periodic breakouts and short consolidation phases. Recently, Period 39 (4212) marked a significant jump, confirming the breakout from the 3300-3400 unit range identified in the carry-over insights. Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has grown from 3282 to 4212, representing a total increase of 28% and an average period-over-period growth of approximately 232 units. The last three observations (P37-P39) specifically show growth of +300, +181, and +283 units respectively. Given the current momentum and the pattern of established new peaks, the demand for Period 40 is projected to continue this trajectory, targeting a level between 4450 and 4550 units as the product establishes a new baseline above the 4000-unit mark.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive growth phase sustained: The average demand for P37-P39 (3963) is 17.5% higher than the P33-P36 baseline (3372), confirming a successful transition into a 4000+ unit demand regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trajectory, having increased from 3448 in Period 36 to 4461 in Period 40. Over the last four periods (P37-P40), the average period-over-period increase is approximately 253 units. The growth from P39 to P40 (+249 units) aligns closely with this recent average. While the product historically exhibits minor consolidation corrections (e.g., P28, P20, P10), the current momentum remains strong and has comfortably surpassed the 4000-unit threshold. Based on the consistent slope of the last four observations, I project a continued increase of roughly 250 units for Period 41.

Carry-over insight: Growth acceleration confirmed: Average period-over-period demand increase has reached ~250 units over the last four periods (P37-P40), sustaining the new demand regime above 4000 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a long-term aggressive upward trend characterized by periodic 'spike-and-correction' cycles. Period 41 (4166) showed a 6.6% correction following the peak in Period 40 (4461). Historical parallels at Period 10, Period 20, and Period 28 demonstrate that these pullbacks are typically followed by a consolidation or immediate recovery phase. Specifically, after the correction in Period 28, demand recovered by ~6.5% in the subsequent period. Given the current trajectory and the established support level above 4100 units, I anticipate a partial recovery in Period 42 toward the 4300-unit range as the market stabilizes before the next potential breakout.

Carry-over insight: Demand correction pattern confirmed: Period 41 (4166) represents a 6.6% pullback from the Period 40 peak, mirroring cyclical corrections observed at Periods 10, 20, and 28. Despite this, the P39-P41 average (4279) remains 27% higher than the P33-P36 baseline (3372).

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has followed a consistent pattern of aggressive growth legs followed by 1-2 period corrections or consolidation phases (seen at P10, P20-21, and P28). The current period follows a two-period decline from the P40 peak (4461), with demand dropping to 4166 in P41 and 4040 in P42. Historically, these pullbacks find a floor and reverse within 2-3 periods. The decline slowed from a drop of 295 units (P41) to 126 units (P42), suggesting the correction is bottoming out. Based on previous recovery cycles (e.g., P21 to P22), I expect demand to begin its recovery in Period 43, moving back toward the established 4200+ baseline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a correction phase following the peak of 4461 in Period 40. This is the fourth major correction observed in the series (previous ones occurred at P10, P20, and P28). Notably, this is the first time the pullback has lasted three consecutive periods (P41-P43), dropping from 4461 to 3950 (-11.4% total). However, the velocity of the decline is slowing significantly: from a 6.6% drop in P41 to 3.0% in P42 and 2.2% in P43. Historically, these corrections lead to a consolidation period or a sharp rebound. Given the slowing rate of decline and the support levels established around Period 38 (3929), I anticipate demand will stabilize and begin a slight recovery in Period 44.

Carry-over insight: Demand correction phase extending: Period 41-43 show a sustained 3-period decline (total -11.4%), the longest pullback in the series. However, the rate of decline is slowing (-6.6% to -2.2%), suggesting a potential floor near 3950-4000 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, characterized by sharp growth phases followed by brief cyclical corrections. After peaking at 4461 in Period 40, demand underwent a three-period correction (Periods 41-43), finding a support level at approximately 3950 units. Period 44 (4444) showed a powerful recovery, jumping 12.5% from the Period 43 floor and nearly reaching the previous all-time peak. Historically, such strong recovery signals (similar to Period 11, 22, and 29) lead to a breakout into a new demand ceiling in the following periods. Given the average growth rate of ~200-250 units during expansionary phases, Period 45 is expected to surpass the Period 40 peak and establish a new high-demand baseline.

Carry-over insight: Resumption of growth cycle confirmed: Following a 3-period correction to a floor of 3950, demand recovered to 4444 in Period 44 (+12.5%). This mirrors previous cyclical patterns where demand rapidly returns to and exceeds prior peaks within 1-2 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established long-term upward trajectory, characterized by periodic growth phases followed by short-term corrections. After a 3-period correction to a floor of 3950 (P41-P43), demand rebounded sharply in Period 44 (4444) to nearly match the previous peak of 4461 (P40). Period 45 (4364) shows a minor consolidation (-1.8%), mirroring previous cycles (like Period 20 or 34-35) where a slight pause follows a recovery spike before the next breakout. Given that demand has successfully tested the 4400-level support twice in the last two periods, the forecast anticipates a transition into a new peak phase, targeting a level slightly above the previous all-time high of 4461.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization above 4350 confirmed: Following the recovery spike in P44, demand has held steady above the 4350 level in P45, suggesting the previous resistance near 4450 is being converted into a new support zone before a potential breakout.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new growth leg after recovering from the Period 41-43 correction. Period 46 (4530) successfully broke the previous peak established in Period 40 (4461), signaling a breakout from the 44000-4450 resistance zone. Historical analysis shows that once a previous peak is surpassed (as seen in P11, P22, and P31), demand typically continues to scale upward for 2-4 periods before the next consolidation. The current trajectory following the P44 recovery shows a steady build (P44: 4444, P45: 4364, P46: 4530). I expect demand to continue its upward momentum in Period 47, targeting the 4700-4800 range, consistent with the growth velocity observed in prior breakout phases (averaging 150-250 units per period).

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed at Period 46: Demand (4530) has surpassed the previous Period 40 peak (4461), ending the correction/consolidation phase and establishing a new support floor above 4500 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, characterized by cyclical growth followed by brief corrections. After a three-period pullback ending at Period 43 (3950), demand recovered sharply and has now achieved two consecutive periods above the previous peak of 4461 (Period 40). Period 46 (4530) and Period 47 (4595) confirm a new breakout into a demand regime exceeding 4500 units. Given the consistent period-over-period growth observed in the last two intervals (+166 units and +65 units respectively), I expect demand to continue scaling upward toward the 4700 level as it establishes this new baseline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a sustained growth phase following the cyclical correction observed in Periods 41-43 (floor of 3950). Over the last five periods (P44-P48), demand has shown a strong recovery and subsequent breakout, moving from 4444 to 4776. The most recent three observations (4530, 4595, 4776) demonstrate accelerating momentum, with Period 48 representing a 3.9% increase over Period 47. This mirrors previous growth cycles (e.g., P30-P34) where demand typically climbs for 4-6 periods following a breakout before hitting a new consolidation ceiling. Given the current velocity (+181 units in the most recent step), I expect demand to continue its upward trajectory toward the 5000-unit milestone.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase confirmed: Period 46-48 average (4633) is 17% higher than the Period 41-43 correction baseline (4052), indicating a successful breakout from the 4500-unit resistance level.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive long-term upward trajectory, recently breaking the 5000-unit threshold in Period 49 (5087). Analysis of recent periods (P46-P49) shows an accelerating growth pattern with increases of 65, 181, and 311 units respectively. Historically, the product exhibits a 'spike and consolidate' pattern: major peaks (like P19, P27, and P40) are often followed by a brief correction or stabilization phase. Given the 6.5% jump in P49, a minor stabilization or slight continuation is expected. The average growth over the last 4 periods is approximately 185 units. Applying a slightly more conservative growth estimate to account for potential stabilization after hitting the 5000-unit milestone leads to a forecast in the 5200-5300 range.

Carry-over insight: Aggressive growth phase sustained: Period 49 (5087) marks a new demand peak and the first instance of demand exceeding 5000 units. The average period-over-period increase has accelerated to 185 units over the last 4 observations (P46-P49), confirming the breakout from the 4500-unit resistance level.
