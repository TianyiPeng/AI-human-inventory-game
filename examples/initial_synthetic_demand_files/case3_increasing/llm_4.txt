Inventory planning must account for a lead time of up to 3 periods (L+1 = 4 periods of coverage). Total inventory required for 4 periods at the current regime is approximately 16,800 units.

Therefore, the effective pipeline is 6,600 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 7,559 units. To reach the 16,800 unit target and mitigate the high risk of stockouts in this volatile growth phase, a significant order is required.

We need ~9,600 units to arrive across P49 and P50. P44 (5000) is 5 periods old and highly likely lost or severely delayed. P47 (3500) and P48 (500) are in the pipeline.
