The product 'chips(Regular)' shows historical demand samples of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], averaging approximately 111.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and will be available for demand in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). To maintain a safe service level, I must cover the demand for (L+1) periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Total expected demand over 5 periods is 111.4 * 5 = 557 units. Since there is currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place an initial order of 557 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand once the lead time concludes.
