Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime between 4,000 and 4,600 units, with an average demand of approximately 4,375 units over the last 7 periods (P41-P47). The most recent demand (Period 47) was 4,595, indicating that the upper end of this range is currently relevant. Lead time is reliably 0. On-hand inventory is currently very low (11 units). Given that the game is near its conclusion (Period 48 of 50), the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory in the final period (P50). For Period 48, I will target a stock level of 4,600 units to cover the current high-end demand. Since lead time is 0, the order placed now arrives in Period 48. Total needed = target (4,600) - current on-hand (11) = 4,589.",

Period 49 (Period_49) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues its pattern of relentless long-term growth and high volatility. Period 48 demand reached 4,776, surpassing the previous Period 40 peak of 4,461 and resulting in a stockout. Over the last 5 periods (P44-P48), demand has averaged 4,541 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 4,000-4,400 range. Lead time is confirmed as 0, allowing for same-period arrival. To maximize profit and prevent stockouts in this high-demand, high-growth environment, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 49 plus a significant safety stock buffer. Given recent growth, I will forecast Period 49 demand around 4,800-4,900. To protect against another spike and ensure the service level is maintained with 0 current on-hand inventory, I will place an order for 5,000 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "New demand breakout confirmed: Period 48 demand (4,776) represents a new all-time high and a 14% increase over the Period 41-43 stabilization level (~4,052), suggesting the SKU has entered a new expansion phase above 4,700 units.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive expansion trend. Period 49 demand reached a new all-time high of 5,087 units, surpassing the previous Period 48 peak (4,776) and resulting in a stockout despite an order of 5,000 units. This marks the third consecutive period where demand exceeded 4,500 units and the second consecutive stockout. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Since Period 50 is the final period of the game, I must order exactly enough to meet the expected demand for this period without overstocking, as any remaining inventory will incur holding costs and contribute nothing to profit. Given the consistent upward momentum and recent demand levels (P48: 4,776, P49: 5,087), I forecast Period 50 demand at approximately 5,300-5,400 units. I will order 5,400 units to maximize revenue potential for this final period while minimizing the risk of another stockout in a high-growth phase.",
