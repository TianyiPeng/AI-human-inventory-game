Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods shows a range between 94 and 138, with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.6. There is no clear linear trend, as the values fluctuate (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). Given that this is Period 1 of the forecasting task and no specific calendar events are linked to this period name, the forecast should lean towards the historical average while acknowledging the recent volatility. The most recent data point (94) is lower than the average, but the period before it was the series high (138). Balancing these, I will forecast near the historical mean.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 111 units (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). The most recent observed demand (Period 1) was 91 units, which is slightly below the historical average but remains within the typical variance of the training set (range 94-138). There are no specific calendar events or product-specific drivers provided for Period 2 to suggest a significant spike or drop. Therefore, the forecast is based on a weighted average of recent performance and long-term historical mean, expecting a slight reversion toward the mean from the Period 1 low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows an average of 111.4 units across the initial training data (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). In the test phase, Period 1 started at 91 units, but Period 2 saw a significant spike to 246 units, which is more than double the long-term average. This spike suggests a potential event or promotional activity. Since Period 3 is the immediate follow-up to this spike, demand often remains elevated but begins to normalize or 'cool down' unless a sustained regime shift is occurring. I am forecasting a slight regression toward the mean while accounting for some residual momentum from the Period 2 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed a low-demand baseline around 111 units. However, observed demand in the test phase shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 2. Demand jumped from 91 in Period 1 to 246 in Period 2 and 285 in Period 3. This indicates a sustained increase in demand levels compared to the initial training data. Period 3 represents a 15% increase over Period 2, suggesting a strong upward momentum or a new higher stable mean. For Period 4, I expect the demand to remain within this new high-volume regime, likely continuing the slight upward trend seen between periods 2 and 3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 2: Average demand increased from ~110 to ~260+ (+136% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1496.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 2. Historical training data (avg 111) is no longer representative. Since Period 2, the demand has shown a strong, accelerating upward trend: 246, 285, and 437. Period 4 saw a massive spike to 437 (+53% over Period 3). While the growth is aggressive, the 'carry-over insight' confirms the shift to a high-demand regime. Given the steep climb in the last period, a further increase is projected, though tempered slightly to account for potential variance in this new high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend acceleration: Demand increased from 246 (Period 2) to 437 (Period 4), indicating a momentum-driven growth phase within the new high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1649.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift starting at Period 2. The historical training data average was ~111, but recent observations show a rapid upward trajectory: Period 2 (246) to Period 5 (448). The growth rate between Periods 4 and 5 slowed significantly (from 437 to 448, a ~2.5% increase) compared to previous jumps, suggesting the rapid acceleration phase may be stabilizing into a new high-demand plateau. Based on the recent momentum and the slight tapering of the growth curve, I expect a modest increase for Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: After rapid growth between Periods 2-4, demand has plateaued around the mid-400s (Periods 4-5 average: 442.5), suggesting the initial regime shift expansion is cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2316.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a clear multi-stage upward trend. Period 1 started low (91), followed by a massive shift (Period 2: 246, Period 3: 285). Previous insights suggested a plateau in Period 5 (448), but Period 6 (587) represents a secondary, significant surge of +31% over the previous period. The 'stabilization' noted in the previous carry-over insight was premature, as demand has resumed a sharp upward trajectory. The current momentum suggests another increase, though potentially more moderate than the previous jump. I will forecast a continued increase based on the established upward momentum seen in Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge confirmed at Period 6: Demand broke the previous ~440 plateau, rising to 587 (+31% increase), invalidating the stabilization hypothesis and indicating a renewed growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2391.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a severe upward regime shift. Following an initial jump in Period 2, the demand has climbed consistently. Recent demand shows a clear acceleration: Period 6 (587) and Period 7 (637). The difference between Period 6 and 7 is +50 units. While the growth from Period 3 to 4 was larger (+152), the move from 4 to 5 (+11) suggested a plateau that was immediately debunked by the growth in Period 6 and 7. Given the current momentum, the demand is expected to continue rising. Applying a moderate growth factor consistent with the last period's absolute increase (+50), I project the demand to reach approximately 687.

Carry-over insight: Continued growth trajectory: Demand has increased for two consecutive periods following the Period 6 surge, maintaining a growth rate of ~50 units per period (Periods 6-7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3021.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory with distinct step-ups. Following the initial regime shift at Period 2, we have seen consistent growth. Specifically, recent periods show an accelerating trend: Period 6 (+139), Period 7 (+50), and Period 8 (+139). Calculating the moving average of the last three periods (666.6) vs. the last two (706.5) shows significant momentum. The average increment over the last three periods is approximately 109 units per period. Given the recent jump of 139 units from Period 7 to 8, I anticipate continued growth. Applying a conservative growth estimate based on the recent average increment to the last observed value (776 + 100) suggests a forecast in the high 800s.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-growth regime confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (6-8) with an average period-over-period gain of ~109 units, indicating strong market momentum.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3738.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant and accelerating growth phase. Historical observations show a consistent upward trajectory: Period 6 (587), Period 7 (637), Period 8 (776), and Period 9 (963). The most recent jump from Period 8 to 9 was +187 units (+24%), which follows a growth of +139 units (+21.8%) in the previous step. The trend is exponential rather than linear. Given the momentum observed in the last two periods (average gain of ~163 units), I expect demand to continue rising significantly. Following the trend of ~20% growth, the forecast is set to approximately 1150 units.

Carry-over insight: Acceleration of growth regime: The period-over-period increase has jumped from ~50 units (Periods 6-7) to ~160 units (Periods 8-9), indicating a shift from linear to exponential-like growth in the current phase.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand analysis reveals a strong growth trajectory characterized by 'stepped' increases. Following a period of exponential-like growth from Period 7 to 9 (reaching a peak of 963), Period 10 shows the first significant decline (-100 units). Historically, jumps in demand (P2, P4, P6) have been followed by periods of relative stabilization or smaller gains (P3, P5, P7). The drop in Period 10 suggests that Period 9 was likely a temporary peak and demand is now seeking a new, higher plateau. Period 11 is expected to stabilize within the 850-920 range, potentially reclaiming some of the ground lost in the P10 correction as the long-term trend remains bullish.

Carry-over insight: Growth regime cooling: After reaching a peak of 963 (P9), demand corrected to 863 (P10), marking the first significant decline in the test phase and suggesting a transition from acceleration to stabilization.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an aggressive upward trajectory with high volatility. Analysis of the recent test periods reveals a pattern of surges followed by brief corrections: a plateau at P4-P5 (~440), a dip at P10 (863 vs P9 963), followed by a massive surge at P11 (1136). The P11 value represents a 31% increase from P10 and a new all-time high. Historically, after a massive surge (like P8-P9), the demand tends to either correct slightly or slow down as it seeks a new mean. Given the extreme volatility and the clear upward momentum but acknowledging the 'cooling' mechanism observed in P10, I expect the demand to remain high but potentially undergo a minor stabilization/correction phase similar to P5 or P10 before the next leg up.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak and extreme volatility confirmed at Period 11: Demand reached an all-time high of 1136, maintaining a general upward regime but displaying high variance (period-over-period swings exceeding 25%).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals a multi-stage growth trajectory with periodic 'step-ups'. Following a minor correction in Period 10 (863), demand surged in Period 11 (1136) and continued to a new peak in Period 12 (1221). The last two periods (P11-P12) maintain an average of approximately 1178 units, representing a new high-demand regime. While the growth rate slowed from Period 11 (+273) to Period 12 (+85), the trend remains positive. Based on the pattern of 2-period consolidations seen earlier (e.g., P2-P3, P4-P5), Period 13 is likely to either stabilize around the 1200-1300 range or show a moderate increase. I am forecasting a continued but decelerating rise to 1295, reflecting the sustained upward momentum observed since Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth into 1100+ regime confirmed: Periods 11-12 average 1178 units, marking a 33% increase over the Period 8-10 average (884), though period-over-period acceleration is beginning to taper.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent long-term upward trajectory. Analyzing recent performance, the growth has moved from a rapid acceleration phase (Periods 8-11) into a stabilization phase at a high plateau. Over the last three periods (P11, P12, P13), demand has been 1136, 1221, and 1246 respectively. The period-over-period growth has decelerated significantly (from 7.5% at P12 to 2% at P13), suggesting the market is reaching a local ceiling or saturation point for the current regime. Forecast logic: Given the slight upward momentum persists but is slowing, I expect a modest increase, continuing the stabilization trend around the mid-1200s.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization in high-demand regime confirmed: Demand has settled into a 1200+ range over the last three periods (P11-P13), with period-over-period growth slowing from double-digits to ~2%, indicating a transition from growth to a stable plateau.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from an aggressive growth phase (Periods 2-9) into a high-demand stabilization period. Over the last three periods (P12-P14), the demand has consistently stayed above 1200 units, but the rate of growth is slowing significantly: from 1221 to 1246 (+2.0%) and 1246 to 1265 (+1.5%). This deceleration in increments (+25 units, then +19 units) suggests the product is reaching a market plateau. Following this trend of diminishing returns on growth, I anticipate a modest increase of approximately 15 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5885.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a consistent upward trajectory punctuated by periods of rapid acceleration followed by brief stabilization. Previous insights suggested a plateau in the 1200s (Periods 12-14), but Period 15 significantly invalidated this with a surge to 1507 (+19.1% period-over-period). This pattern mirrors previous growth cycles (e.g., the jump from 863 to 1136). While the increase is substantial, history shows that after massive jumps (like P9), there is occasionally a consolidation or a slightly smaller growth step. Given the strong momentum, I expect demand to follow the new upward trend but at a more tempered rate than the +242 unit jump seen in Period 15.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed at Period 15: Demand broke the 1200-range plateau, increasing from 1265 to 1507 (+19%), signaling a resurgence of growth momentum after a three-period stabilization phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5769.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple growth cycles. After a significant stabilization period (P11-P14) around the 1200 mark, a new growth phase began at P15 (1507) and continued into P16 (1547). This latest move represents a ~20% step-up from the previous regime. The growth between P15 and P16 (40 units, or ~2.6%) suggests that while the jump was large, the immediate follow-through is moving toward stabilization or slower linear growth rather than exponential acceleration. Based on the behavior of previous surges (e.g., P4-P5 and P12-P13), the most likely outcome is a period of consolidation at this new 1500+ level with slight upward drift.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization in new 1500+ regime: Demand has maintained a new level for two periods (avg 1527) following the P15 surge, echoing previous step-up patterns seen in P12-P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6608.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a clear 'step-ladder' growth pattern. Historically, periods of rapid growth (P2-P4, P6-P9, P11-P12) are followed by plateaus or stabilization phases. However, the most recent data shows a sustained and accelerating upward trajectory: P15 (+19%), P16 (+3%), and P17 (+11%). The last three periods (P15-17) average 1593 units. The jump to 1724 in P17 suggests we are either at the peak of this current growth burst or entering a short stabilization phase. Given the strong momentum in the last period, I expect demand to remain high but potentially slow its growth rate slightly as it consolidates near the 1700-1800 range.

Carry-over insight: Renewed growth acceleration confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P15-P17), with a significant jump to 1724 units, marking a ~14% increase over the P15 starting level of this surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6766.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward 'stair-step' growth pattern. Historically, the product undergoes a significant jump followed by 2-3 periods of relative stabilization or moderate growth within that new range. Most recently, following the surge to the 1500s in Period 15, demand has climbed to 1724 (P17) and 1802 (P18). Over the last three periods (P16-P18), the average period-over-period growth rate is approximately 8.5%. Given the consistent momentum from P17 to P18 (+78 units), I anticipate continued high demand. I will forecast a moderate increase consistent with the current growth phase, positioning the next period in the lower 1900s to account for the sustained upward trajectory before the next potential plateau.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime expansion confirmed: Demand has crossed the 1800-unit threshold at P18, having grown consistently for four consecutive periods (P15-P18) with a total increase of ~19.5% during this interval.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a staircase-like growth trajectory. Analyzing the recent cycle (P15-P19), the pattern consists of a large 'step-up' followed by a smaller 'consolidation' period: P15 (+19%), P16 (+2.7%), P17 (+11.4%), P18 (+4.5%), and P19 (+15.2%). Since Period 19 was a significant jump that pushed demand over the 2,000-unit threshold for the first time, historically the next period (P20) is likely to be a consolidation phase with more moderate growth. Applying a conservative growth estimate of approximately 4-5% (similar to P16 and P18) to the Period 19 baseline of 2,075 suggests a forecast in the 2,160-2,180 range. I will project 2,172.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 19: Demand has crossed the 2,000-unit threshold, marking a fifth consecutive period of growth and a 37% increase over the Period 14 baseline (1,265).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong long-term upward trajectory, characterized by significant growth periods followed by minor corrections or brief stabilization phases. Most recently, Period 19 reached a new peak of 2,075 units, followed by a slight correction in Period 20 to 1,973 units (a ~5% decrease). This behavior mirrors the correction seen at Period 10 (863 units) which was immediately followed by a jump to a new high (1,136 units). Given the robust momentum observed from P15 to P19 (where demand grew by ~37%), the dip at Period 20 is interpreted as a temporary pullback rather than a regime shift. I expect demand to recover and resume its upward trend, likely targeting a new level above the previous peak of 2,075.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has exhibited a distinct step-climb pattern throughout the test phase. Most recently, demand surged past the 2,000-unit mark at Period 19 (2075) and has subsequently entered a stabilization phase across Periods 20 and 21 (1973 and 1983 units, respectively). This mirrors previous behavior where a rapid growth phase (Periods 15-19) is followed by a plateau period. The current average over the last two periods is 1978 units. Given the transition from high growth to stabilization observed in earlier regimes (e.g., Periods 11-14 and Periods 4-5), I anticipate demand will remain relatively flat or show very marginal movement around the current level for Period 22.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in 2000-unit regime confirmed: Periods 20-21 show a narrow variance (0.5% change) following the Period 19 peak, indicating a temporary halt in the growth momentum observed from Periods 15-19.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a series of step-up regime shifts followed by brief stabilization periods. Recently, after a five-period growth phase (Periods 15-19) that peaked at 2075, the demand stabilized around 1980 units for two periods (20-21). Period 22 shows a significant new breakout to 2221 units, representing a 12% increase from the previous period and establishing a new all-time high. Based on historical patterns, a 'breakout' period is frequently followed by an immediate continuation of that momentum or a high-level consolidation. Given the strong upward trajectory and the pattern of growth spurts observed in periods 2-4, 6-9, and 15-19, I expect demand to maintain this new level or slightly increase as the new regime settles.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase breakout at Period 22: Demand jumped to 2221 (+12% MoM), breaking the 2000-unit resistance level and signaling a potential end to the Period 20-21 stabilization phase.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a strong step-up growth pattern. Historically, the product transitions from a stabilization phase (e.g., Periods 20-21 at ~2000 units) into a growth breakout (Period 22: +238; Period 23: +105). Over the last five periods (P19-P23), the growth has moved the baseline from ~1800 units to ~2300 units. The most recent period (P23) showed a growth of 4.7% following the 12% jump in P22, suggesting the momentum of the current breakout is still active but potentially starting to normalize. Given the trend of multi-period growth phases observed in previous cycles (P15-P19), I expect a further moderate increase in P24 as it settles into this new higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth in the 2200+ regime: Periods 22-23 confirm a successful breakout from the 2000-unit plateau, with an average demand of 2273 units (a 15% increase over the P20-P21 average).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a strong growth phase, having broken out from a stabilization period at Periods 20-21 (~1,980 units). For the last three periods (P22-P24), demand has increased consistently: 2,221 (+12%), 2,326 (+4.7%), and 2,566 (+10.3%). The average period-over-period increase during this breakout is approximately 194 units. Current momentum indicates that demand will continue to rise as it follows the historical 'step-and-climb' pattern observed in previous growth cycles (e.g., P15-P19). My forecast adds approximately the average growth increment (194) to the last observed value (2,566) while accounting for the acceleration seen in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Continued growth breakout confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P22-P24) with an average period-over-period gain of ~194 units, marking a 20% increase over the Period 20-21 stabilization level.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through multiple phases, SKU chips(Regular) has demonstrated a consistent pattern of rapid growth followed by brief stabilization periods. Historical data shows significant step-ups (regime shifts) rather than linear growth. Specifically, the last four periods (P22-P25) have seen demand rise from 2221 to 2604, representing a substantial sustained breakout from the previous 2000-unit plateau. Analysis of recent momentum shows period-over-period growth of +4.7% (P22-P23), +10.3% (P23-P24), and +1.5% (P24-P25). While the growth rate slowed slightly in the most recent period, the overall trend remains strongly positive with the moving average climbing steadily. I expect demand to show another moderate increase as it probes the upper resistance of this current 2600+ regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained growth regime expansion: Demand has consistently stayed above 2500 units for two consecutive periods (P24-P25), marking a ~30% increase from the Period 21 level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a consistent pattern of rapid growth followed by short stabilization periods. Currently, the product is in a high-demand regime characterized by five consecutive periods of growth (P22-P26), moving from 1,983 to 2,645 units (+33%). However, the rate of growth has slowed significantly over the last three periods: P24 (+10.3%), P25 (+1.4%), and P26 (+1.6%). This mirrors previous stabilization phases observed at P4-P5, P12-P14, and P20-P21. Given that the demand has settled into the 2,600-unit range for the last two periods, I expect a continued stabilization or a very marginal increase as the current growth cycle reaches its ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Stabilization in 2600+ regime: Period-over-period growth has slowed to an average of ~1.5% over the last two periods (P25-P26), indicating a cooling phase after the rapid breakout from the 2200-unit level.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established pattern of step-wise growth followed by brief stabilization periods. Recently, the demand moved from a stable phase around 2600 units (Periods 25-26) to a new peak of 2890 in Period 27, representing a 9.2% increase. Historically, throughout this series (e.g., Periods 2-4, 6-9, 15-19, 22-24), growth bursts typically span 3-5 periods before plateauing. Given the strong jump in the most recent period (P27), I anticipate the upward momentum to continue into Period 28, albeit with a slight moderation in the growth rate as it explores the new 2800-3000 unit regime. My forecast projects a continued trajectory toward the 3000-unit milestone, estimating an increase of approximately 3-4% over Period 27.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase breakout confirmed at Period 27: Demand jumped to 2890 units (+9.2%) after a brief two-period stabilization around the 2600-unit level, signaling a continuation of the long-term upward trajectory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a consistent long-term upward trajectory characterized by 'step-up and stabilize' cycles. Following a significant breakout to a peak of 2890 in Period 27, demand underwent a correction in Period 28 to 2643 (-8.5%), which mirrors previous patterns seen after major peaks (e.g., Period 10 and Period 20). Historically, these corrections lead to either a brief stabilization or the start of a new growth leg. Given that Period 28 returned precisely to the level of Period 26 (2645), it indicates a solid floor has been established in the 2600+ range. I expect Period 29 to resume a moderate growth path, moving back toward the previous peak as the long-term trend remains firmly positive.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by 'stair-step' growth patterns: a period of rapid acceleration followed by a brief stabilization or minor correction before the next leg up. Most recently, demand peaked at 2890 (P27), followed by a correction to 2643 (P28) and a subsequent recovery to 2814 (P29). This behavior mirrors the P19-P21 period where demand peaked, dipped, and then consolidated before breaking higher. Specifically, the recovery in P29 suggests the market is attempting to break the 2800-2900 resistance. Given the historical average growth rate between cycles and the immediate bounce-back from the P28 dip, I expect demand to continue its recovery toward the recent peak.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by alternating phases of rapid growth and brief stabilization/correction. After the breakout at Period 27 (2890 units), the demand experienced a sharp correction in Period 28 (2643 units) but has since stabilized and started recovering over the last two periods (P29: 2814, P30: 2873). The current demand level (avg. P27-P30 \u2248 2805) represents a new high-demand regime, significantly above the previous 2600-unit plateau. Given the recent two-period recovery trend and the historical tendency for the product to consolidate before attempting new peaks, I expect Period 31 to show continued modest growth, returning toward the previous resistance level established in Period 27.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime at 2800+ confirmed: Despite a correction at Period 28, the average demand for Periods 27-30 is 2805 units, marking a successful floor above the previous Period 24-26 plateau (~2600 units).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, long-term upward trajectory characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by brief stabilization phases. Recently, demand successfully broke the 2800-unit resistance level (Periods 29-30) and accelerated to a new record high of 3046 in Period 31 (+6% growth). Analysis of previous breakouts (e.g., Period 15, Period 22) shows that demand typically maintains momentum for 2-4 periods after crossing a psychological threshold. Period 31 is the third consecutive period of growth since the Period 28 correction, and the acceleration (from +59 units in P30 to +173 units in P31) suggests strong current demand. I expect demand to follow this momentum into the low 3100s, applying a conservative growth estimate of ~2-3% over the Period 31 peak.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout at Period 31: Demand crossed the 3,000-unit threshold for the first time, marking a 17% increase over the Period 28 correction level (2643) and signaling a new high-demand regime.

Historically, the product follows a stepwise growth pattern: a significant jump above a threshold, followed by a brief period of stabilization or minor correction (as seen in Period 32: 3005), and then a resumption of the upward trend or consolidation in the new higher range. The current 2-period average (P31-P32) is 3025.5, while the 5-period average (P28-P32) is 2876. Given the consistent historical pattern of establishing a new floor after reaching a milestone, Period 33 is expected to stay above the 3000-unit mark with a slight upward trajectory towards the previous peak as the market absorbs the new regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime above 3,000 units: Periods 31-32 have maintained an average of 3025 units, representing a successfully held position above the previous 2800-unit resistance level (Period 31 breakout).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory, characterized by a series of step-ups followed by brief stabilization periods. In Period 33, demand jumped significantly to 3,391 units, a 12.8% increase over Period 32 (3,005). This breakout mirrors previous patterns (e.g., Period 11, Period 15, Period 22, Period 27) where a surge is typically followed by either a slight further increase or a consolidation near the new peak. The historical growth rate since Period 1 has consistently shifted the demand floor upward. Given that Period 33 set a strong new peak reaching nearly 3,400 units, I anticipate Period 34 will likely consolidate near this level or experience a slight secondary growth push, consistent with the 'High-demand regime expansion' logic seen in the Carry-over Insights.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout at Period 33: Demand reached a record 3,391 units (+12.8% over P32), establishing a new peak above the previously identified 3,000-unit regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, multi-stage upward trajectory characterized by significant growth spurts followed by short stabilization phases. Most recently, demand broke the 3,000-unit resistance level at Period 31 and surged to a new peak regime in Periods 33-34, averaging 3,380 units. The transition from Period 33 (3,391) to Period 34 (3,368) shows a slight cooling (-0.7%), mirroring previous stabilization behaviors seen at the 2,000 and 2,600-unit levels. Based on historical patterns where the product consolidates for 2-3 periods before the next growth leg or a minor correction, the forecast for Period 35 expects demand to remain within the established 3,300-3,400 range. I am projecting a slight recovery toward the recent peak while accounting for the minor deceleration observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Consolidation in 3300+ regime: Periods 33-34 have established a new demand floor with an average of 3380 units, representing an 11% increase over the previous Period 31-32 stabilization level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a step-like growth trajectory. Following the breakout at Period 33 (3,391 units), demand has entered a consolidation phase, with the last two periods showing slight cooling (3,368 and 3,282 units respectively). This pattern of a sharp peak followed by a 2-3 period stabilization is consistent with historical regime shifts observed in Periods 20-21 (2,000-unit plateau) and Periods 31-32 (3,000-unit plateau). Given that Period 35's demand (3,282) remains within the 3,300+ regime identified in Carry-over Insights but indicates a localized downtrend, the forecast for Period 36 assumes continued stabilization near the average of the current high-demand floor (3,347 units), slightly adjusted for the recent softening.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory, characterized by a 'stair-step' growth pattern: rapid breakouts followed by high-level stabilization. Recently, the product shifted from a ~3000-unit regime (P31-P32) to a 3300+ regime (P33-P35). Period 36 showed a new peak of 3448, which is a +5% increase over the previous period and the highest demand recorded to date. The three-period average (P34-P36) is 3366, but the most recent two periods (P35-P36) show positive momentum (rebounding from 3282 back to 3448). Given the historical trend often sees a consolidation period or a slight further climb after hitting a new peak within a high-growth regime, I expect demand to remain strong near the 3450-3500 level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime at 3400+ confirmed: Demand has averaged 3372 over the last four periods (P33-P36), establishing a new support level approximately 11% higher than the previous P31-P32 plateau.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trajectory. Historically, the product has followed a pattern of rapid growth phases followed by short consolidation periods. Recently, after a stabilization phase in the 3300-3400 range (Periods 33-36), Period 37 saw a significant breakout to 3748 units (+8.7%). This mirrors previous regime shifts (e.g., P27, P31, P33). Given this new upward momentum and the historical tendency for growth spurts to last 2-3 periods before plateauing, I expect demand for Period 38 to continue increasing as it settles into this new higher regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed at Period 37: Demand reached 3748 units, an 8.7% increase over the previous four-period average (~3372), signaling a shift from the 3300-3400 plateau to a new 3700+ level.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong long-term upward trajectory characterized by step-up growth phases followed by short consolidation plateaus. Most recently, Period 37 triggered a new growth breakout from the ~3370 level, with Period 38 jumping to 3929. This follows a pattern where new levels are tested and then validated. The last two periods (P37 and P38) show growth of +8.7% and +4.8% respectively. Given that Period 38 is approaching the 4,000-unit psychological resistance level and the historical behavior often sees a brief stabilization or deceleration after a two-period surge (as seen in P33-P35), I forecast a slight moderation in the growth rate for Period 39 while remaining firmly within the new high-demand regime established in P37-P38.

Carry-over insight: Sustained shift to 3700+ regime confirmed: Periods 37-38 average 3838 units, representing a 14% increase over the previous stable baseline of ~3370 units (P33-P36).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong long-term upward trajectory characterized by step-up growth phases followed by brief stabilizations. Recently, the demand broke out of the ~3400-unit plateau (observed in P33-P36) and entered a new high-growth acceleration phase. Over the last three periods (P37-P39), demand has increased from 3748 to 4212, representing a 12.4% total increase in the interval and averaging a period-over-period growth of approximately 232 units (+6%). Given the strong momentum in the last three periods (P37: +300 units, P38: +181 units, P39: +283 units), I expect the upward trend to continue for Period 40. Applying the average growth rate of the current breakout suggests a target around 4444 units, though I am tempering the growth slightly to lean towards the higher-end of the recent mean to account for potential stabilization after three consecutive large jumps.

Carry-over insight: New growth acceleration phase confirmed at Period 39: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P37-P39) with an average period-over-period gain of ~232 units (+6.1%), moving the demand regime from ~3400 to over 4200 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trajectory, having increased for four consecutive periods (P37-P40). Current demand has risen from 3,748 in Period 37 to 4,461 in Period 40, reflecting an average period-over-period gain of approximately 237 units (+5.9%) during this latest breakout. Historically, these growth phases typically last 4-5 periods before entering a stabilization or correction phase. Given the momentum observed in the last two periods (increases of 283 and 249 respectively), I expect one more significant upward move into the 4700+ range before the trend potentially plateaus.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime above 4,000 units confirmed: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P37-P40), resulting in a 19% increase over the previous support level of ~3,400 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a long-term upward trajectory, characterized by step-up growth phases followed by brief stabilization periods. Recently, the demand surged from a plateau of ~3400 units (Period 36) to a peak of 4461 units (Period 40), marking a 4-period growth streak. Period 41 showed a correction to 4166 units (-6.6%). Historically, when a period-over-period decline occurs after a significant surge (as seen in Period 10, 20, 28, and 32), the demand typically stabilizes or resumes growth slightly above the mid-point of the previous surge. The current 4000+ regime appears well-supported by the average of the last three periods (4280 units). Given the correction in Period 41, I expect demand to stabilize near the 4200 level as it establishes a new support floor.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis reveals a consistent 'step-up' pattern: rapid growth followed by a correction and stabilization before the next move. Recent demand peaked at 4,461 (Period 40) before correcting downward to 4,166 (Period 41) and 4,040 (Period 42). This correction (approx. -9.5% from peak) is consistent with past regime shifts (e.g., Period 10, Period 28). The decline rate slowed significantly between P41 and P42 (-6.6% to -3.0%), suggesting the demand is finding a support floor near the 4,000-unit mark. Based on previous cycles, demand typically stabilizes or begins a modest recovery after a two-period correction.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in 4000-unit regime: Following the Period 40 peak of 4,461, demand has corrected and stabilized above 4,000 units (P41-P42 avg: 4,103), following the typical post-surge cooling pattern observed in previous cycles.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data for chips(Regular) shows a characteristic pattern of a rapid surge followed by a cooling stabilization phase. Demand peaked at Period 40 (4,461 units) and has since declined for three consecutive periods: Period 41 (4,166), Period 42 (4,040), and Period 43 (3,950). This represents a transition from the growth phase (P37-P40) to a consolidation phase, similar to patterns seen in Periods 9-10 and Periods 33-35. The carry-over insight from Period 43 notes stabilization within the 4000-unit regime, although the most recent data point (3,950) has dipped slightly below that threshold. Given the dampening week-over-week losses (-290, -126, -90), the decline is slowing. I predict a minor further correction to reach a sustainable floor near the previous 3,900-4,000 support level before the next potential growth cycle.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is characterized by a strong long-term upward trajectory, frequently moving in 'steps' where a sharp surge is followed by a brief period of stabilization or correction. Recently, demand peaked at 4,461 in Period 40, followed by a three-period cooling phase that bottomed out at 3,950 in Period 43. Period 44 showed a significant rebound to 4,444 (+12.5% vs P43), effectively re-testing the previous peak. Historically, such strong rebounds often lead to a breakout or a period of consolidation at the new high. Given the momentum in Period 44 and the average growth rate observed in previous breakout phases, I expect Period 45 to maintain this level or slightly exceed it as the new 4,400+ regime establishes itself.

Carry-over insight: New growth phase confirmed at Period 44: Demand surged back to 4,444 units after a three-period correction, reclaiming the peak levels observed at Period 40 and suggesting a support level around the 4,000-unit mark.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by brief stabilization/consolidation intervals. Most recently, demand surged to a peak of 4,461 in Period 40, followed by a three-period correction to a floor of 3,950 (Period 43). This was followed by a resurgence in Period 44 (4,444 units), which has now transitioned into a new consolidation phase at 4,364 units (Period 45). Historically, these consolidation phases following a surge typically last 2-3 periods before the next growth leg begins. The current stability between P44 and P45 (avg 4404) suggests a temporary plateau. Based on the pattern of previous regimes (e.g., P33-P36 or P41-P43), I expect the demand to remain within this 4,300-4,500 range in the immediate term before any further breakout.

Carry-over insight: New demand floor confirmed at 4,300+ regime: Periods 44-45 have stabilized with an average of 4,404 units following the Period 43 correction, reclaiming the previous peak levels of Period 40.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent step-up growth pattern characterized by sharp surges followed by brief periods of stabilization or slight correction before establishing a new demand floor. Recently, demand recovered from a three-period correction (P41-P43: 4166 to 3950) by surging back to 4444 in P44. The last period (P46) recorded a new all-time high of 4530, breaking the previous P40 resistance level of 4461. The current 3-period average (P44-P46) is 4446, reflecting a significant recovery from the 4000-unit mark. Given that this product typically maintains momentum for 2-4 periods after breaking a resistance level, I expect demand to either stabilize near the current peak or continue a modest upward trajectory toward the 4600 range.

Carry-over insight: New demand peak and resistance breakout at Period 46: Demand reached 4,530 units, successfully surpassing the previous Period 40 peak (4,461) and confirming the end of the Period 41-43 correction phase.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trend characterized by step-up growth phases followed by brief consolidations. Recently, after a correction that saw demand dip to 3,950 (Period 43), the product has entered a new growth phase. Period 46 (4,530 units) successfully broke the previous resistance level of 4,461 (Period 40), and Period 47 (4,595 units) confirmed this breakout with a continued (though slower) period-over-period increase of 1.4%. Given this pattern of sustained growth following a breakout, I anticipate a modest continuation of demand for Period 48 as it moves further into the 4,600+ territory before the next likely stabilization phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained breakout above 4,500 regime: Demand has maintained growth for two consecutive periods (P46-P47) after breaking the previous Period 40 peak (4,461), establishing a new high-demand ceiling.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term upward trajectory characterized by incremental periods of stabilization followed by rapid breakout surges. Recently, the demand has broken out of the ~4,400 unit resistance level, with three consecutive periods of growth (P46: 4530, P47: 4595, P48: 4776). The most recent jump of ~4% from Period 47 to 48 indicates accelerated momentum within this new high-demand regime. History shows that these surges typically sustain for 3-5 periods before plateauing. Given the current trend and the strength of the breakout past the 4,500 mark, I expect a continued increase for Period 49, though at a slightly more moderate rate as it approaches a potential new psychological resistance level near 4,900-5,000.

Carry-over insight: Sustained breakout surge confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P46-P48), rising from 4,364 to 4,776 (+9.4%), establishing a new demand regime above the previous 4,500 resistance level.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, multi-stage upward trajectory characterized by growth bursts followed by short consolidation phases. Recent performance confirms a new breakout: after stabilizing around the 4,000-4,400 mark (Periods 41-45), demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P46-P49), recently crossing the 5,000-unit threshold for the first time. The last three periods (P47-P49) show an accelerating trend with gains of +65, +181, and +311 units respectively. Given the momentum observed in Period 49 (+6.5% WoW) and the historical pattern of sustained surges reaching a peak before a minor correction, I expect continued growth into Period 50. I am projecting a moderated increase relative to the last jump to account for potential stabilization near the next psychological resistance level.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime above 5,000 units confirmed at Period 49: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P46-P49), marking a 16.5% increase over the Period 45 level and breaking the previous 4,700 resistance ceiling.
