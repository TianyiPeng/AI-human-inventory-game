Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Summary: The past demand values are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average of these observations is 111.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: No specific calendar dates or events are provided beyond 'Period 1'. Chips are a stable consumer good, but often see spikes during weekends or sporting events; however, without a calendar, we rely on the mean. 3. Trend Analysis: The data shows volatility but no clear linear trend. The most recent value (94) is lower than the average, while the penultimate value (138) was a peak. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the lack of a clear trend and the absence of specific calendar drivers, the forecast is centered near the historical mean. Weighting the more recent volatility and the overall average, a prediction of 111 is reasonable as a reversion to the mean.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The training data shows a mean of 111.4 units (range 94-138) with no obvious linear trend. 2. Seasonal/Calendar: Period 2 lacks specific calendar attributes, so baseline behavior is assumed. 3. Recent Trend: The most recent observation (Period 1) was 91 units, which is slightly below the historical average but close to the training minimum (94). 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the low value in Period 1 (91), I expect a slight mean reversion toward the historical average while acknowledging the recent softness. I will forecast a value near the lower end of the historical distribution to stay conservative.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data for 'chips(Regular)' showed a relatively stable mean around 111 units (range 94-138). In the test phase, Period 1 demand (91) was consistent with this baseline. However, Period 2 saw a significant spike to 246 units, which is more than double the historical average. This suggests a sudden demand driver, such as a promotion, a local event, or the start of a seasonal peak. Since Period 3 follows immediately after this spike, I expect demand to remain elevated but potentially regress slightly as the initial surge peaks. I will forecast a value higher than the historical mean but lower than the Period 2 peak to account for sustained interest.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Pattern Summary: The training data showed a relatively stable demand averaging ~111 units. However, the observed test data shows a significant shift. 2. Seasonal/Calendar Considerations: No specific dates provided, but the jump from Period 1 (91) to Period 2 (246) suggests a major event or regime shift. 3. Recent Trend Analysis: Demand increased sharply in Period 2 and continued to rise in Period 3 (285). The last two periods (246, 285) are significantly higher than the training average and Period 1. 4. Final Forecast Logic: Given the strong upward momentum and the level established in the last two periods, I expect demand to remain in this higher range, likely continuing a slight upward trajectory or stabilizing near the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 2: demand increased from an average of ~110 to ~265 (+140%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1628.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
1. Historical Analysis: Demand started at 91 (Period 1). A significant shift occurred at Period 2, moving the average from ~110 (historical) to ~265. 2. Recent Trend: The last three periods show a steep upward trajectory (246 -> 285 -> 437). The jump from 285 to 437 (+53%) suggests a strong growth phase or a seasonal peak in progress. 3. Final Forecast Logic: While Period 4 reached 437, such a sharp spike might see a slight stabilization or continued momentum. I will forecast a value that respects the growth trend while remaining cautious of the extreme outlier-like jump in Period 4, targeting the 450 range to account for the sustained upward momentum observed in the carry-over insight.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend confirmed: demand increased from 246 in Period 2 to 437 in Period 4 (+77% growth over 3 periods).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical training data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (Avg ~111) has been superseded by a significant upward regime shift starting at Period 2. The observed demands for Periods 2 through 5 are [246, 285, 437, 448]. Analysis shows a strong upward trend: Period 2 to 3 increased by ~16%, Period 3 to 4 increased by ~53%, and Period 4 to 5 stabilized with a small ~2.5% increase. The current demand level has established a new plateau or slowing growth trend around the 440-450 range. Given the slowing growth rate between Period 4 and 5, I expect Period 6 to remain near the current level with a slight continued upward drift.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateauing at new high: Period 4 and 5 average ~442, representing a sustained +300% increase over Period 1 levels.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend with a distinct 'staircase' pattern: a significant jump followed by a period of relative stability. Recent demand periods are P4: 437, P5: 448, and P6: 587. The jumps occurred at P2 (+155), P4 (+152), and P6 (+139), while the intervening periods (P3, P5) showed much smaller growth (+39, +11). Following the large jump in P6, history suggests P7 will likely be a period of consolidation or minor growth. Averaging the previous 'small growth' increments (39 and 11) gives approximately 25 units. Adding this to the P6 value (587) results in a forecast of 612.

Carry-over insight: Continued upward trend: demand reached a new peak of 587 in Period 6. The pattern exhibits a recurring 'jump and plateau' cycle, with major increases occurring every two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand shows a distinct 'jump and plateau' cycle occurring every two periods. Periods 2-3 averaged ~265, Periods 4-5 averaged ~442 (+177), and Periods 6-7 averaged ~612 (+170). Period 7 (637) followed the 'plateau/slight increase' phase of the cycle. Based on the consistent step-up pattern observed in Periods 2, 4, and 6 (increases of +155, +152, and +139 respectively), Period 8 is expected to be a 'jump' period. Applying the average step increase of approximately 148 units to the previous plateau's starting point (Period 6: 587) or a similar jump from the most recent period, the forecast anticipates a significant rise. Given the previous jump was from 448 to 587 (+139), a similar jump from 637 suggests a value in the high 700s.

Carry-over insight: Consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle confirmed: average demand increases by ~170 units every two periods (Step 1: ~265, Step 2: ~442, Step 3: ~612).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' pattern occurring every two periods. Steps in demand are observed as follows: Step 1 (P2-P3) averaged ~266; Step 2 (P4-P5) averaged ~443 (+177); Step 3 (P6-P7) averaged ~612 (+169). Period 8 shows a new jump to 776 (an increase of +164 from the Step 3 average). Following the established pattern, Period 9 is expected to be the 'plateau' phase for this new level, meaning demand should remain close to the Period 8 value.

Carry-over insight: Step 4 growth confirmed: Demand jumped to 776 in Period 8, maintaining the established 'jump and plateau' cycle with an average step increase of ~170 units every two periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle, typically increasing significantly every two periods. Historical analysis shows steps at Periods 2, 4, 6, and 8. Specifically, the demand jumps to a new level and then either plateaus or grows moderately before the next major jump. Period 8 saw demand at 776, and Period 9 saw a massive jump to 963 (+187 units), which is slightly earlier or more aggressive than the historical average step of ~170 units. Given that Period 9 was a 'jump' period, Period 10 is expected to be a 'plateau' or consolidation period where demand stabilizes near the new peak. I am forecasting a slight increase to account for the momentum seen in Period 9, but staying close to the 960-980 range.

Carry-over insight: Step 5 growth cycle confirmed: Demand jumped to 963 in Period 9, continuing the established 'jump and plateau' pattern with a step increase of ~187 units from the previous peak.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) follows a 'jump and plateau' pattern, with steps occurring roughly every two periods. Step 1 (P2-P3) averaged 265, Step 2 (P4-P5) 442, and Step 3 (P6-P7) 612. Step 4 (P8) reached 776, and Step 5 (P9-P10) established a new mean of 913, despite a correction in P10 (863). Period 11 marks the start of Step 6. Following the average step increase of ~170 units from the previous step average (913), and accounting for the recent jump magnitude (P8 to P9 was +187), a jump to 1050 is forecasted for P11.

Step 1 (P2-P3) averaged ~265, Step 2 (P4-P5) ~442 (+177), Step 3 (P6-P7) ~612 (+170), Step 4 (P8-P9) ~869 (+257), and Step 5 (P10-P11) ~1000 (+131). Period 11 saw a significant spike to 1136, representing the peak of Step 5. Period 12 marks the beginning of Step 6. Historically, the start of a new step involves a significant jump from the previous step's average. Given the average step-to-step increase of approximately 184 units, the average for Step 6 (P12-P13) is projected to be around 1184. Considering P11 reached 1136, P12 is expected to initiate this new level, likely landing near the projected step average.

Carry-over insight: Step 6 growth cycle initiated: average demand for Step 5 (P10-P11) confirmed at 999.5, maintaining the 'jump and plateau' pattern with a step increase of ~130 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle, where a significant step increase typically occurs every two periods. Step 5 (Periods 10-11) averaged 999.5 units. Period 12 saw a significant jump to 1221 units, marking the start of Step 6. Based on historical patterns (P2-3, P4-5, P6-7, P8-9), the second period of a step usually sees a moderate increase or stabilization relative to the first period of that step. With Period 12 at 1221, Period 13 is expected to plateau slightly higher or maintain this level. Given the average step increases observed previously (~130-180 units), and the jump from ~1000 to ~1221, I forecast a slight consolidation growth for Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Step 6 growth confirmed: Period 12 demand jumped to 1221, a +22% increase over the Step 5 average (999.5), continuing the 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle occurring every two periods. Analysis of the test data reveals: Step 1 (P2-P3) averaged ~265, Step 2 (P4-P5) averaged ~442 (+177), Step 3 (P6-P7) averaged ~612 (+170), Step 4 (P8-P9) was irregular but showed a jump, Step 5 (P10-P11) averaged ~999.5 (+130 vs Step 4 average), and Step 6 (P12-P13) averaged 1233.5 (+234). Period 14 marks the start of Step 7. Given the average step increment over the last several cycles is approximately 175-200 units, I anticipate a jump from the Step 6 average (1233.5) to approximately 1420.

Carry-over insight: Step 6 growth cycle completed: Step 6 (P12-P13) established a new demand baseline at 1233.5, representing a +23% increase over the Step 5 average.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a distinct 'jump and plateau' pattern, where demand spikes significantly every two periods and then stabilizes for two periods. Step 6 (comprising Periods 12 and 13) established a baseline average of 1233.5. Period 14 (1265) represents the start of a potential new 'jump' phase or a continuation of the plateau. Historically, after a plateau phase (like P12-P13), a jump occurs. However, the last few periods (P12: 1221, P13: 1246, P14: 1265) show a more gradual, linear increase rather than a sharp step jump. Given the consistent upward momentum and the start of a new two-period cycle (Step 7), I expect the demand to continue its upward trajectory. The increase from P13 to P14 was 19 units; applying this growth to P14 suggests a forecast near 1284.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a 'jump and plateau' growth cycle. Historically, the product experiences a significant increase in demand (a 'jump' period) followed by 1 or 2 periods of stability at that new baseline (a 'plateau' period). Step 6 was established between Periods 12 and 14 with a baseline average of approximately 1244. Period 15 showed a significant jump to 1507 (+242 units or ~19% increase), signaling the start of 'Step 7'. Following the established pattern where a jump is followed by a stabilization period, the demand for Period 16 is expected to plateau near the Period 15 level. I am forecasting 1525 to account for the slight upward variance typically seen during the first plateau period following a jump.

Carry-over insight: Step 7 growth cycle initiated: Period 15 demand jumped to 1507, representing a ~19% increase over the Step 6 average (~1265). This maintains the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle, typically shifting to a new higher demand regime every two periods. The Step 6 average (P12-P14) was approximately 1244. Period 15 initiated Step 7 with a jump to 1507, which was sustained in Period 16 (1547), resulting in a Step 7 average of 1527. Following the historical pattern where a new jump occurs every two periods (P2, P4, P6, P8, P11, P12, P15), Period 17 is expected to initiate 'Step 8'. The magnitude of recent jumps has been increasing: the jump from Step 5 to Step 6 was ~244 units, and Step 6 to Step 7 was ~283 units. Applying a conservative growth estimate of approximately 250-280 units to the Step 7 average (1527) suggests a forecast in the 1775-1810 range. Given the momentum in P16 (which was higher than P15), I anticipate a strong jump.

Carry-over insight: Step 7 growth cycle completed: Step 7 (P15-P16) established a new demand baseline at 1527, representing a ~23% increase over the Step 6 average (~1244).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a well-documented 'jump and plateau' pattern, where demand spikes to a new level and remains relatively stable for approximately 2-3 periods before jumping again. Historical analysis shows Step 6 (P12-P14) averaged ~1244 and Step 7 (P15-P16) averaged ~1527 (a ~23% increase). Period 17 recorded 1724 units, which signifies the start of Step 8. Based on the established pattern, Step 8 is expected to persist for at least two periods (P17 and P18). Given that the jump in P17 (1724) is approximately 13% higher than the Step 7 average, and typical jumps range from 13-23%, I expect Period 18 to align closely with the new level established in Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Step 8 growth cycle initiated: Period 17 demand jumped to 1724, representing a ~13% increase over the Step 7 average (~1527), continuing the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle, where demand increases significantly every two to three periods before stabilizing at a new baseline. Step 7 (Period 15-16) established a baseline average of ~1527. Period 17 saw the initiation of Step 8 with a jump to 1724, followed by 1802 in Period 18, establishing a new baseline average of 1763. Historically, the 'jump' phase typically lasts two periods before either plateauing further or jumping again. Period 19 is expected to remain within this Step 8 plateau or show slight organic growth within the established range. Given the increase from 1724 to 1802, a slight continuation of the upward momentum within the current step is anticipated.

Carry-over insight: Step 8 growth cycle completed: Step 8 (P17-P18) established a new demand baseline at 1763, representing a ~15% increase over the Step 7 average (~1527).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a robust 'jump and plateau' growth pattern, where a significant increase occurs every two periods followed by a secondary slight increase or plateau. Step 7 (P15-P16) established a baseline of ~1527, and Step 8 (P17-P18) established a baseline of ~1763. Period 19 (2075) initiated Step 9, representing a 17.7% increase (+312 units) over the Step 8 baseline. Historically, the second period of a growth step (the plateau phase) shows a moderate increase of 2% to 4% over the jump period (e.g., P16 was +2.6% over P15; P18 was +4.5% over P17). Applying a similar logic to Period 19 (2075), I anticipate Period 20 will settle in the 2140-2160 range. A forecast of 2150 represents a 3.6% increase over P19, consistent with the observed plateau behavior in previous steps.

Carry-over insight: Step 9 growth cycle initiated: Period 19 demand jumped to 2075, representing a ~18% increase over the Step 8 average (1763), maintaining the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a well-documented 'jump and plateau' pattern, where demand spikes significantly and then stabilizes for two periods. Historically, this cycle occurs every two periods: Step 7 (P15-P16) averaged 1527, Step 8 (P17-P18) averaged 1763 (a ~15% increase), and the current Step 9 cycle initiated in Period 19 with a jump to 2075. Period 20 demand was 1973, resulting in a Step 9 plateau average of 2024. Following the established pattern, Period 21 marks the start of a new 'Step 10' growth cycle. The average step increase over the last four cycles has been approximately 15-18%. Applying a conservative 15% increase to the Step 9 average (2024 * 1.15) suggests a jump to approximately 2328.

Carry-over insight: Step 9 growth cycle completed: Step 9 (P19-P20) established a new demand baseline at 2024, representing a ~15% increase over the Step 8 average (1763).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle, where demand increases significantly every two periods and then stabilizes. Historical data shows: Step 6 (P12-P14) avg ~1244, Step 7 (P15-P16) avg ~1527 (+23%), Step 8 (P17-P18) avg ~1763 (+15%), and Step 9 (P19-P21) avg ~2010 (+14%). The last three periods (P19, P20, P21) have recorded demands of 2075, 1973, and 1983, indicating that the 'plateau' phase of Step 9 has been reached and sustained for three periods. Based on the established pattern where a growth jump occurs after a plateau of 2-3 periods, Period 22 is highly likely to initiate Step 10. Calculating the average percentage increase of the last three steps (~17%), a jump from the Step 9 average (2010) would project demand to approximately 2352. I will forecast a jump to this new level.

Carry-over insight: Step 9 growth cycle completed: Step 9 (P19-P21) established a new demand baseline at 2010, representing a ~14% increase over the Step 8 average (1763).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a 'jump and plateau' growth pattern. Based on the Carry-over Insights and historical data, the product transitions to a new higher demand baseline (a 'jump') approximately every 2-3 periods, followed by a stabilization phase (a 'plateau'). The Step 9 plateau (Periods 19-21) had a mean demand of 2010. In Period 22, demand jumped to 2221, which is a +10.5% increase over the previous plateau, signaling the start of a Step 10 growth cycle. Historically, these 'jump' periods are followed by at least one additional period at the new elevated level before the next jump occurs. Therefore, I expect Period 23 to remain within the Step 10 plateau range. Given the variance observed in recent cycles (e.g., Step 8 jumped and then grew slightly in the second period), I forecast Period 23 to be slightly higher than Period 22 to reflect the establishment of this new baseline.

Carry-over insight: Step 10 growth cycle initiated: Period 22 demand jumped to 2221, representing a ~10.5% increase over the Step 9 average (2010), maintaining the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle. Step 9 (Periods 19-21) established a baseline average of 2010 units. Step 10 initiated at Period 22 with demand jumping to 2221 and continued at Period 23 with 2326, resulting in a Step 10 average so far of 2273.5 (a ~13% increase over Step 9). Historically, these plateaus last for either 2 or 3 periods (Step 6 and Step 9 both lasted 3 periods, while Steps 7 and 8 lasted 2). Given that the jump into Step 10 was relatively recent and the pattern of 3-period plateaus occurs every few cycles, it is highly probable that Period 24 will serve as the third and final period of the Step 10 plateau before the next jump. I forecast demand to remain within the Step 10 range, specifically near the most recent observation to account for the slight internal upward variance within the plateau.

Carry-over insight: Step 10 growth cycle completed: Step 10 (P22-P23) established a new demand baseline at ~2274, representing a ~13% increase over the Step 9 average (2010).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a well-defined 'jump and plateau' growth cycle. Step 10 was established in Periods 22-23 with an average demand of ~2274. Period 24 saw a significant jump to 2566 (+12.8% increase), signaling the initiation of Step 11. Historically, after a jump period, the following period typically maintains this new high level or shows a slight additional increase as the plateau stabilizes. Comparing past 'second periods' of a jump cycle (e.g., P3 vs P2, P5 vs P4, P23 vs P22), demand often grows by 2-5% before plateauing. Therefore, for Period 25, I expect demand to remain at or slightly above the level observed in Period 24.

Carry-over insight: Step 11 growth cycle initiated: Period 24 demand jumped to 2566, representing a ~12.8% increase over the Step 10 average (~2274), continuing the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle, where demand typically remains stable for 2-3 periods before jumping to a new baseline. Historically, this step increase ranges from 10-15%. Step 10 (Periods 22-23) averaged ~2274. Step 11 began at Period 24 (2566) and continued at Period 25 (2604), establishing a new baseline average of 2585 (+13.7% increase). Based on the established pattern where steps typically last 2-3 periods, Period 26 is likely to initiate 'Step 12'. Applying the recent growth rate of ~13.5% to the Step 11 average (2585 * 1.135) suggests a jump to approximately 2934. Recent step jumps have been significant, and Period 26 marks the third period since the last jump, fitting the cycle for a new upward shift.

Carry-over insight: Step 11 growth cycle completed: Step 11 (P24-P25) established a new demand baseline at 2585, representing a ~13.7% increase over the Step 10 average (2274).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle, where a significant increase occurs roughly every 2-3 periods followed by a consolidation phase. Step 11 was established between Period 24 and Period 26 with demands of 2566, 2604, and 2645, resulting in a Step 11 average of 2605. This represents a ~14.5% increase over the Step 10 average (2274). Historical patterns show that after 2-3 periods of plateauing, a new 'jump' to a higher baseline typically occurs. Since the current plateau (Step 11) has lasted for 3 periods (P24-P26), I anticipate a growth jump in Period 27. Based on recent step increases ranging from 11% to 15%, a ~13% increase from the Step 11 baseline (2605) suggests a new target level around 2940-2950.

Carry-over insight: Step 11 growth cycle completed: Step 11 (P24-P26) established a new demand baseline at 2605, representing a ~14.5% increase over the Step 10 average (2274).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis confirms a consistent 'jump and plateau' demand pattern. Every 2-3 periods, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' jumps to a new baseline and stabilizes. Recent steps have shown: Step 9 (P19-P21) averaged ~2010, Step 10 (P22-P23) averaged ~2274 (+13%), and Step 11 (P24-P26) averaged ~2605 (+14.5%). Period 27 recorded a significant jump to 2890 (+10.9% over the Step 11 average), signaling the start of Step 12. According to the established cycle, the period following a jump typically initiates a plateau at or near that new peak. Forecast for Period 28 is set to 2935, anticipating a slight consolidation typical of previous plateau phases (e.g., P24 at 2566 followed by P25 at 2604).

Carry-over insight: Step 12 growth cycle initiated: Period 27 demand jumped to 2890, representing a ~10.9% increase over the Step 11 average (2605), maintaining the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a highly consistent 'jump and plateau' demand pattern, where demand spikes to a new level and remains relatively stable for 2\u20133 periods. Following Step 11 (P24-P26 average: 2605), a new jump occurred at Period 27 (2890). Period 28 saw a regression to 2643, which is closer to the Step 11 average than the Period 27 peak. This volatility is characteristic of the start of a plateau phase (similar to Step 9, where the initial jump to 2075 was followed by 1973 and 1983). For Period 29, demand is expected to remain within this Step 12 plateau. Calculating the average of the Step 12 observations so far (P27: 2890, P28: 2643) gives 2766.5. Given the product's overall upward trajectory, Period 29 is forecasted to settle slightly above the Period 28 level but below the Period 27 peak, targeting the current Step 12 mean.

Carry-over insight: Step 12 growth cycle confirmed: Step 12 (P27-P28) has established an initial average of 2766.5, representing a 6.2% increase over the Step 11 average (2605).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a well-documented 'jump and plateau' growth cycle where demand increases to a new baseline and stabilizes for 2-3 periods. Step 11 (P24-P26) established a baseline of ~2605. Step 12 began at P27 (2890) and continued through P28 (2643) and P29 (2814), resulting in a Step 12 average of 2782.3. Historically, these steps alternate between 2 and 3 periods in length. Since Step 11 lasted 3 periods and Step 10 lasted 2, it is highly probable that Step 12 has concluded after its 3-period run (P27-P29). Therefore, Period 30 is expected to initiate 'Step 13'. Looking at recent step increases\u2014Step 11 (+14.5%) and Step 12 (+6.8%)\u2014a jump of approximately 8-12% over the Step 12 average (2782) is anticipated. A 10% increase suggests a forecast of approximately 3060.

Carry-over insight: Step 12 growth cycle completed: Step 12 (P27-P29) established a demand baseline at 2782, representing a 6.8% increase over the Step 11 average (2605).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle, where a significant increase in demand is followed by 2-4 periods of relative stability at a new baseline. Step 12 began at Period 27 (2890) and has plateaued over Periods 28-30 (2643, 2814, 2873), establishing a Step 12 average of 2805 units. Historically, steps have lasted between 2 and 4 periods. Step 12 has now completed 4 periods. Given the pattern of growth typically occurring every few periods, Period 31 is highly likely to initiate 'Step 13'. Recent jump percentages have ranged from 7% to 15%. Applying a conservative jump of approximately 11% to the Step 12 baseline (2805 * 1.11) results in a forecast of 3113.

Carry-over insight: Step 12 growth cycle completed: Step 12 (P27-P30) established a final demand baseline at 2805, representing a 7.7% increase over the Step 11 average (2605).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle. Step 12 (Periods 27-30) established a baseline average of 2805. Period 31 saw a jump to 3046, which is an 8.6% increase over the Step 12 average, signaling the initiation of Step 13. Historically, once a new step begins, the demand plateaus at this higher level for 2-4 periods. Therefore, Period 32 is expected to remain in the 3000-3150 range. I will forecast a slight stabilization/increase consistent with previous plateau behavior (e.g., Step 11 moved from 2566 to 2604, Step 10 moved from 2221 to 2326).

Carry-over insight: Step 13 growth cycle initiated: Period 31 demand jumped to 3046, representing a ~8.6% increase over the Step 12 average (2805), maintaining the 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a well-documented 'jump and plateau' pattern. Step 12 (Periods 27-30) established a baseline of 2805. Period 31 saw a jump to 3046, signaling the initiation of Step 13. Period 32 demand was 3005, confirming the start of the plateau phase at this new level. Historically, these plateau phases last between 2 and 4 periods. Since we are only on the second period of the Step 13 level (P31-P32), I expect Period 33 to remain within this current regime. The average of the Step 13 observations so far is 3025.5, and I forecast Period 33 to stay near this baseline.

Carry-over insight: Step 13 growth cycle confirmed: Step 13 (P31-P32) has established an initial average of 3025.5, representing a 7.9% increase over the Step 12 average (2805).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a well-established 'jump and plateau' growth pattern. Historically, these growth cycles consist of a jump in demand followed by 2-3 periods of stabilization. Step 12 (Periods 27-30) established a baseline average of 2805. Step 13 began in Period 31 with a jump to 3046. The data from Period 31 (3046) and Period 32 (3005) suggested a stabilization period. However, Period 33 shows a sudden jump to 3391, which represents a ~12.3% increase over the Step 13 initial plateau and a ~21% increase over the Step 12 average. This indicates the start of Step 14 earlier than the typical 3-4 period cycle length observed previously. Given this strong upward momentum and the consistent regime-shifting nature of the product, Period 34 is expected to remain at this new elevated level (the 'plateau' phase of the new Step 14). I will forecast a value consistent with the new baseline established in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Step 14 growth cycle initiated: Period 33 demand jumped to 3391, representing a ~12.3% increase over the Step 13 average (3017), continuing the 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' cycle, typically shifting to a new baseline every 2-3 periods. Period 33 initiated Step 14 with a jump to 3391, followed by Period 34 at 3368, establishing a current baseline average of 3379.5. Historical patterns show that once a jump occurs, the demand stabilizes at this new level for at least two periods (sometimes three) before jumping again. Given that Step 14 has only had two periods (P33 and P34), Period 35 is expected to remain within this plateau range. The forecast is set at 3384, reflecting the average of the last two periods with a slight upward bias consistent with the long-term trend.

Carry-over insight: Step 14 growth cycle confirmed: Step 14 (P33-P34) has established a demand baseline at 3379.5, representing a ~12% increase over the Step 13 average (3017).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth model. Step 13 (Periods 31-32) established a baseline of 3025.5. Step 14 (Periods 33-35) saw a jump to an average of 3347 [(3391+3368+3282)/3], representing a 10.6% increase over the Step 13 average. Looking at historical step durations (Step 11: 3 periods, Step 12: 4 periods, Step 13: 2 periods, Step 14: 3 periods), the product is now entering Period 36, which is statistically likely to initiate a new jump (Step 15). Historically, these jumps range between 8% and 14%. Applying a conservative ~10% growth factor to the Step 14 average (3347 * 1.10) suggests a new demand level around 3680. Although Period 35 showed a slight dip (3282), similar variances were seen in prior plateaus (e.g., Period 28) before the next jump.

Carry-over insight: Step 14 growth cycle completed: Step 14 (P33-P35) established a demand baseline at 3347, representing a ~10.6% increase over the Step 13 average (3025.5).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle where demand increases to a new level and stabilizes for 2-4 periods before jumping again. Step 14 (Periods 33-35) established a baseline average of 3347. Period 36 showed a demand of 3448, which is a +3% increase over the previous step average. While this is a modest increase compared to historical jumps (which often range from 7-15%), the pattern suggests we are transitioning into Step 15. Historically, once a new level is reached, the subsequent period remains near that new baseline. Therefore, the forecast for Period 37 is set at 3450, projecting a continuation of the new level established in Period 36.

Carry-over insight: Step 15 growth cycle initiated: Period 36 demand reached 3448, representing a ~3% increase over the Step 14 average (3347), continuing the 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a 'jump and plateau' growth model. Analysis of recent steps shows: Step 12 (P27-P30) averaged 2805; Step 13 (P31-P32) averaged 3025 (+7.8%); Step 14 (P33-P35) averaged 3347 (+10.6%). Step 15 began in Period 36 (3448) and experienced a significant further jump in Period 37 (3748). Based on historical behavior, after a major jump (like the +300 unit increase from P36 to P37), the demand typically plateaus or stabilizes for 1-2 periods. Therefore, the forecast for Period 38 anticipates a plateau near the Period 37 level, with a slight adjustment for the variance seen in previous plateau phases.

Carry-over insight: Step 15 growth cycle confirmed: Period 37 demand reached 3748, establishing a new peak and representing a ~12% increase over the Step 14 average (3347), continuing the jump and plateau trend.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a robust 'jump and plateau' pattern. Step 14 (Periods 33-35) established a baseline of 3347. Step 15 began in Period 36 (3448) and accelerated significantly through Period 37 (3748) and Period 38 (3929). The current average for Step 15 (P36-P38) is 3708, representing a 10.8% increase over the Step 14 baseline. Historically, these growth cycles last between 2 to 4 periods before stabilizing or jumping again. Given the sharp increase in the last two periods (+300 then +181), Period 39 is expected to either maintain this new high or experience a slight consolidation within the 3850-4000 range, typical of the 'plateau' phase following a significant jump. I forecast a slight stabilization around 3895.

Carry-over insight: Step 15 growth cycle completed: Step 15 (P36-P38) established a demand baseline at 3708, representing a 10.8% increase over the Step 14 average (3347).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a well-documented 'jump and plateau' growth cycle. Step 15 (Periods 36-38) established a baseline average of 3708 units. Period 39 saw a significant jump to 4212 units (+13.6%), signaling the initiation of Step 16. Historically, these steps consist of a jump followed by a 2-4 period plateau at the new elevated level. Given that Period 39 was the initial jump of Step 16, Period 40 is expected to remain within this new demand regime. I am forecasting a slight stabilization or minor increase consistent with the early phase of previous plateaus.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle initiated: Period 39 demand jumped to 4212, representing a 13.6% increase over the Step 15 average (3708), maintaining the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a 'jump and plateau' pattern where demand increases significantly and then stabilizes for 2-4 periods. The Step 15 average was established at 3708 (Periods 36-38). Step 16 began in Period 39 with a jump to 4212, followed by 4461 in Period 40. The current Step 16 average is 4336.5. Historically, these growth cycles last at least 2-3 periods before the next major jump. Since Period 41 is the third period of Step 16, I expect demand to remain within the established Step 16 range. Given the slight upward variance within the last two steps (e.g., Step 15 values were 3448, 3748, 3929), I anticipate Period 41 will stay near the recent peak of 4461, reflecting the sustained demand levels observed in this cycle.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle confirmed: Step 16 (P39-P40) has established an initial average of 4336.5, representing a ~17% increase over the Step 15 average (3708).

Based on the historical pattern where steps typically last 2 to 4 periods before a new jump, and Step 16 has now completed 3 periods (P39, P40, P41), a new growth cycle (Step 17) is expected to initiate in Period 42. Recent step increases have ranged between 8% and 15%. Applying a conservative jump of ~10% to the Step 16 average (4280 * 1.10) suggests a forecast of approximately 4708.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle completed: Step 16 (P39-P41) established a demand baseline at 4280, representing a 15.4% increase over the Step 15 average (3708).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth pattern. Step 16 (Periods 39-42) has established a demand baseline of approximately 4220 units (P39: 4212, P40: 4461, P41: 4166, P42: 4040). Analysis of previous cycles shows that steps typically last between 2 to 4 periods before a new jump occurs. Given that Step 16 has now persisted for 4 periods, Period 43 is highly likely to initiate Step 17. Historically, the percentage increase between steps has ranged from 8% to 15%. A conservative jump of approximately 10% over the Step 16 average (4220) suggests a new demand level around 4642. I will forecast a jump to this new level for Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle completed: Step 16 (P39-P42) established a demand baseline at 4220, representing a 13.8% increase over the Step 15 average (3708).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a well-documented 'jump and plateau' pattern, where demand shifts to a higher mean every 2\u20134 periods. Step 16 began at Period 39 with a jump to 4212 and reached a peak of 4461 in Period 40. However, since Period 41, demand has seen a consistent decline (4166, 4040, 3950), which is atypical for the plateau phase. Step 16 has now lasted 5 periods (P39\u2013P43), which is longer than the recent step durations (Step 15 was 3 periods, Step 14 was 3, Step 13 was 2). Historical data suggests that a new growth cycle (Step 17) is imminent. Calculating the Step 16 average (approx. 4166) and applying the typical 'jump' magnitude seen in recent cycles (~10\u201313%), a jump to approximately 4600-4700 would be expected. However, given the sharp downward momentum in the last three periods, I expect a transitional period or a slightly more conservative jump for Period 44, targeting the upper end of the Step 16 range before a full breakthrough.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle completed: Step 16 (P39-P43) established a demand average of 4165.8, a 12.3% increase over the Step 15 average (3708), despite a downward trend in the final three periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The 'jump and plateau' growth cycle for chips(Regular) has historically shown a significant demand increase (approx. 10-15%) every 2 to 4 periods, followed by a stabilization phase. Step 16 (Periods 39-44) has been unusually long, lasting 6 periods with an average demand of 4212. After a mid-cycle dip (Periods 41-43), Period 44 showed a strong rebound to 4444 units, returning to the high end of the current plateau. Given the duration of the current step and the momentum seen in Period 44, Period 45 is highly likely to initiate Step 17. Applying a conservative 12% jump to the Step 16 average (4212 * 1.12) suggests a forecast in the range of 4700-4800 units.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle completed: Step 16 (P39-P44) established a final demand average of 4212, representing a 13.6% increase over the Step 15 average (3708).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows that the product 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' demand pattern. The current Step 16 growth cycle began at Period 39 and has been unusually long, spanning seven periods (P39-P45) with an average demand of approximately 4234. Recent observations (P44: 4444, P45: 4364) show the demand stabilizing at the upper end of this plateau. Given the historical frequency of these transitions\u2014which typically occur every 3 to 5 periods\u2014and the duration of the current plateau, a transition to Step 17 is anticipated. Based on previous step increases (averaging 10-15%), a projected jump of approximately 12% from the Step 16 average (4234 * 1.12) suggests a forecast in the 4700-4800 range.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle extended: Step 16 (P39-P45) has established a demand baseline of 4234 units, representing a 14.2% increase over the Step 15 average (3708), currently the longest plateau phase observed.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' pattern. Step 16 (Periods 39-46) has established a demand baseline average of 4271 units. This plateau has lasted 8 periods, which is the longest observed in the data. Period 46 reached a new high for this step (4530), suggesting upward momentum. Historically, jumps to a new step range between 10% and 15% over the previous step's average. Given the length of the current plateau and the recent upward trend in the last three periods (4444, 4364, 4530), a jump to Step 17 is highly probable for Period 47. A projected 12% increase over the Step 16 average (4271 * 1.12) suggests a demand of approximately 4783.

Carry-over insight: Step 16 growth cycle completed: Step 16 (P39-P46) established a final demand average of 4271, representing a 15.2% increase over the Step 15 average (3708). This is the longest plateau observed to date (8 periods).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to follow a 'jump and plateau' growth cycle. Step 16 (Periods 39-47) has become the longest plateau observed, lasting 9 periods with an average demand of approximately 4,307. Recent observations (P44-P47) show a steady upward trend (4444, 4364, 4530, 4595), with Period 47 reaching a new high for this step. Given the typical behavior of this product, this sustained upward movement suggests the initiation of a Step 17 growth cycle. Historical 'jumps' have ranged from 8% to 15%. Applying a projected 10-12% increase over the Step 16 average (4307 * 1.115) leads to a forecast of approximately 4,800 for Period 48.

Carry-over insight: Step 17 growth cycle initiated: Period 47 demand reached 4595, signaling a transition from the extended Step 16 plateau (avg 4307) toward a new baseline, maintaining the established 'jump and plateau' pattern.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' growth cycle, where a significant jump in demand is followed by a period of relative stability (plateau) lasting several periods. Period 47 (4595) initiated the Step 17 growth cycle, jumping from the Step 16 plateau (average ~4307). Period 48 (4776) further increased this baseline, suggesting we are now establishing the Step 17 plateau. Historically, these plateau phases show slight variance but tend to stabilize quickly around the new peak. Given the jump from ~4300 to a current two-period average of 4685, I expect Period 49 to remain within this new higher range as the plateau stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Step 17 growth cycle confirmed: Period 47-48 have established a new baseline average of 4685.5, representing an 8.8% increase over the Step 16 average (~4307).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a consistent 'jump and plateau' pattern. Step 16 concluded after an 8-period plateau (P39-P46) with an average of 4271. Step 17 initiated in Period 47 (4595) and has shown a strong upward trajectory through Period 48 (4776) and Period 49 (5087). The current average for Step 17 (P47-P49) is 4819.3, representing a 12.8% increase over the Step 16 baseline. Historically, these 'jumps' typically last 2-3 periods before establishing a new plateau. Period 49's surge to 5087 suggests we are at the peak of the Step 17 jump or moving into the stabilization phase. I forecast Period 50 to remain near this new high as the demand enters its plateau phase.

Carry-over insight: Step 17 growth cycle confirmed: Demand average for P47-P49 is 4819, representing a 12.8% increase over the Step 16 average (4271), maintaining the 'jump and plateau' pattern.
