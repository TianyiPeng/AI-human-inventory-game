The historical demand data (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for the start of Period 4. Therefore, our target inventory must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). Using the OR algorithm's parameters: Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, resulting in a critical fractile q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8. The corresponding z-score for a 0.8 service level is approximately 0.84. Expected demand for 3 periods is 334.2 (111.4 * 3). Safety stock is 0.84 * (sqrt(3) * 17.6) \u2248 0.84 * 30.5 \u2248 25.6. Base stock level = 334.2 + 25.6 = 360 units. Since current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 0, the raw order is 360 units. The OR recommendation is capped at 141 units to smooth out volatility and prevent over-stocking early in the game.

Since the lead time is 2, these units are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, the 'In-transit' count is 141, and 'arrived=0' in the P1 conclude message is expected and consistent with L=2.\n\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus Period 1's demand of 91 result in an average demand of 108 units per period. The demand appears relatively stable with no clear evidence of regime shifts or seasonal spikes (no specific dates provided yet).\n\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 141 units. To maintain a service level consistent with a critical fractile of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), we aim to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Target inventory (Base Stock) = 3 * 108 + Safety Stock. Using the OR stats, this target is approximately 350 units.\n\n4. Strategy: Total Pipeline Requirement (~350) - Current On-hand (0) - In-transit (141) = 209 units. The OR recommendation is 138 units, which is constrained by its 'cap' formula (single-period mean + buffer) to prevent over-ordering. However, because we started with 0 inventory and missed sales in Period 1 (sold=0 due to 0 on-hand), we need to more aggressively build the pipeline to ensure future demand is met.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand averaged ~111 units, but Period 2 saw a significant spike to 246 units. Period 1 was lower at 91. The OR recommendation (142) uses the long-term mean and promised lead time. 3. Inventory & Strategy: I currently have 0 on-hand. Total pipeline is 321. Total demand over the L+1 window (P3, P4, P5) needs to be covered. If demand remains high (averaging ~170 based on P1 and P2), I need ~510 units. If it returns to mean (~111), I need ~333. 4. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 142 is slightly conservative given the P2 spike.

Since the P6 conclude showed no arrivals and P7-P10 concludes also showed 0 arrivals despite orders being placed, we are facing a significant supply chain delay or total stockout in the pipeline.

However, the orders from P7 (800) and P8 (850) are over 6 periods past their order date and must be written off as lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 5100 - 1650 = 3450 units. These consist of orders from P14 (1600), P13 (0 - note: history says P13 ordered 1000 but it arrived in P14 conclude), P12 (arrived), P11 (arrived), and the remaining in-transit must be the units ordered in P10-P14.

More critically, orders from P7 (800) and P8 (850) are now 10 and 9 periods overdue, respectively; these 1,650 units are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' total is 6,400. Subtracting the 1,650 lost units gives an effective pipeline of 4,750 units (comprising orders from P15, P16, and P17).\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Demand is in a high-growth regime. Recent demands are P14: 1,265, P15: 1,507, P16: 1,547, and P17: 1,724. The 3-period average is ~1,593 units. Given the trend, I expect P18-P20 demand to average at least 1,750 units per period. \n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Effective pipeline is 4,750. Total demand for the risk period (L+1 = 3 periods) is estimated at 5,250 units (1,750 * 3). The current effective pipeline (4,750) is insufficient to cover this expected demand.\n\n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the 1,650 lost units in its pipeline calculation and uses a lagging historical mean that doesn't account for the current 1,700+ demand level. To reach a target stock level of ~5,250, I need to order approximately 500 units (5,250 - 4,750).

Wait, let's re-calculate: Orders outstanding are P26 (2,500). All previous orders through P25 have arrived or are lost. In-transit of 6,200 includes P26 (2,500) + P17 (1,800 lost) + P7/P8 (1,650 lost) + others? Actually, the math: P26 (2,500) + P17 (1,800) + P7/P8 (1,650) = 5,950. The 6,200 roughly matches this.

Current Total Reliable Asset = 4,051 (on-hand) + 2,500 (P26 in-transit) = 6,551. Gap = 7,815 - 6,551 = 1,264 units.

However, accounting for confirmed lost shipments (P7, P8, P17, P27 = 5,950 units), the 'effective' pipeline is much leaner. 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR agent recommends 0 units because the current on-hand inventory (6,271) + pipeline significantly exceeds its calculated base-stock level. However, the OR agent does not account for the continued aggressive demand growth or the risk of future lost shipments. 5. **Decision**: While on-hand inventory covers ~1.6 periods of current demand, we must maintain the pipeline to avoid a stockout in 2-3 periods if demand continues to rise.

We assume a 2-period lead time for planning.\n\n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation of 0 is heavily influenced by the raw 'In-transit' figure (14,000), which it does not realize contains nearly 6,000 lost units.

We are currently in Period 47 of a 50-period game, meaning there are only 4 periods of demand remaining (P47, P48, P49, P50). To maximize profit and minimize terminal holding costs, we must ensure we have enough inventory to cover remaining demand without over-ordering at the end. Total estimated demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 17,800 units (4,450 * 4). Our current inventory position consists of 2,906 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 15,100 units. However, we must subtract the 9,850 units confirmed/likely lost (P7, P8, P17, P27, P38), leaving an effective pipeline of 5,250 units (primarily the P46 order of 4,500). Total effective inventory is thus 2,906 + 5,250 = 8,156 units. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because its internal 'In-transit' calculation does not account for the nearly 10,000 lost units. To cover the ~17,800 units of remaining demand, we need approximately 9,600 more units. I will order 4,500 units this period to maintain the flow, as lead times have recently fluctuated between 1-3 periods, ensuring we don't stock out in the final two periods while leaving room for a final adjustment in Period 48.",

However, based on the historical pattern of losses (Periods 7, 8, 17, 27, and 38), we must verify the effective pipeline. The current in-transit inventory consists of orders from P44 (500), P46 (4,500), P47 (4,500), and older potentially delayed units. Specifically, the P44 order is now 3 periods old and might arrive in P48. Given that we are at Period 48 of 50, we only have three periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50). Our total demand exposure is approximately 13,500 units. We currently have 0 on-hand. The pipeline of recent, reliable orders (P46, P47) plus the P44 order totals 9,500 units. Adding an order of 4,500 units now will bring our total expected supply to 14,000 units, which covers the remaining game duration while minimizing the risk of ending with excessive stock or stockouts.

Confirmed lost orders include P7, P8, P17, P27, and P38, totaling 9,850 units. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P44 (500), P46 (4,500), P47 (4,500), and P48 (4,500), totaling 14,000 units. The order from P44 (500 units) is now 5 periods overdue and highly likely lost based on previous supplier failure patterns for large/overdue orders. Excluding this, the active pipeline is 13,500 units. Since lead times recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, these 13,500 units are expected to arrive across P49 and P50. Total expected demand for the remaining two periods is approximately 9,500 units (4,750 * 2). With an active pipeline of 13,500 units against a target requirement of ~9,500 units, the system is already over-provisioned for the final horizon.

The effective pipeline therefore consists of the orders from Period 48 (4,500 units) and Period 49 (0 units).
