  "rationale": "We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Based on historical data provided (112, 97, 116, 138, 94), the average demand is approximately 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.5. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 141 units. To calculate the necessary inventory position, we must cover demand for L+1 periods (4+1=5). Total expected demand over 5 periods is ~557 units. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to build up the pipeline. The OR recommendation of 141 is actually quite conservative because it's designed to cap single-period orders to smooth the supply chain. However, since we are starting from zero inventory, we need to establish a consistent pipeline. I will follow the OR's recommendation of 141 to start building the inventory ladder without over-ordering before confirming the actual lead time and demand stability in this environment.",

The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on historical averages and is completely decoupled from current reality.

Since demand resolution for Period 50 happens after the Period 50 decision phase but before the conclusion of Period 50, even if the lead time were 1 period, an order placed now would not arrive in time to satisfy any remaining demand in this game. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the units arriving during Period 49 (ordered in Period 45: 3,500 units) will be available to meet Period 49's demand.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The decision for Period 50 is the final action of the game. Since the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 50) would arrive during Period 54, but the game concludes at the end of Period 50. Therefore, any capital spent on new orders will not result in units available for sale within the simulation timeframe and would only serve to reduce the final profit. Reviewing current status: On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has been around 4,500-5,000 units. A shipment of 3,000 units (ordered in Period 46) is scheduled to arrive during Period 50's arrival resolution phase, which will allow for up to 3,000 units to be sold in this final period. The OR algorithm recommends 4,800 units based on its standard logic, but it does not account for the simulation's end at Period 50. I will override the recommendation to 0.",
