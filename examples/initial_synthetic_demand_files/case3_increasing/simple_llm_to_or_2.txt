Period 1 (Period_1) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The historical demand data for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods shows a range between 94 and 138, with a mean of 111.4 and a median of 112. There is no clear linear trend, as the values fluctuate (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). The most recent value (94) is the lowest in the set, but it follows the highest value (138), suggesting high volatility rather than a sustained downward trend. Given the absence of specific holiday calendar indicators for 'Period 1' and the established baseline, the forecast targets the historical average to account for this variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a training period average of 111.4 units (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). The most recent observed demand in Period 1 was 91 units, which is slightly below the previous average but within a normal fluctuation range for snack items. There are no specific calendar events or product-specific drivers identified for Period 2. The forecast assumes a return toward the historical baseline while factoring in the recent soft demand from Period 1.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for chips(Regular) showed a stable baseline (avg ~111 in training). However, Period 2 saw a dramatic shift to 246 units (+121% from Period 1). Such a sharp increase in a snack category suggests a promotional event or a specific large-scale event. Since Period 1 (91) was lower than the training mean and Period 2 (246) was significantly higher, I expect the demand to stabilize or experience a partial correction in Period 3, as intense spikes for 'Regular' chips are often short-lived or driven by stocking behavior. I will project a moderate decrease from the peak while remaining above the historical baseline to account for potential momentum or an ongoing event.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand during the training phase was stable around 111 units. In the test phase, Period 1 started at 91 units, followed by a significant regime shift starting in Period 2 (246 units) and continuing into Period 3 (285 units). This represents a nearly 150% increase from previous averages. Given the strong upward momentum from Period 2 to Period 3 (+39 units), the forecast for Period 4 anticipates a continuation of this high-demand trend, settling slightly higher than Period 3 as the new demand level stabilizes.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical training data showed a low average demand around 111. However, the observed demand for the first four test periods (91, 246, 285, 437) indicates a sharp and sustained upward trend, likely signifying a demand regime shift or a strong seasonal growth period for 'chips(Regular)'. Period 4 reached a peak of 437. Based on the acceleration of demand (+155 between P1 and P2, +39 between P2 and P3, +152 between P3 and P4), I expect the demand to remain high or continue to increase slightly as the trend stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Significant upward demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 2: Average demand increased from historical ~111 to current average of ~322 (+190%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 2. After an initial historical average of ~111, the demand has rapidly expanded. Specifically, the last four periods show values of 246, 285, 437, and 448. This indicates not just a shift in level, but a strong upward trend. The growth between Period 3 and 4 was particularly sharp (~50% increase), while the growth slowed between Period 4 and 5 (~2.5% increase), suggesting the demand might be stabilizing at this new, higher plateau. Given the recent average of the last two periods is 442.5 and the trend is still technically positive, I predict a slight continuation of this momentum for Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Upward trend acceleration confirmed: Peak demand reached ~440 levels in Periods 4-5, establishing a new high-volume baseline significantly above the early Period 2-3 average of 265.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a strong and consistent upward trend since Period 2. The sequence of demand observations (91, 246, 285, 437, 448, 587) indicates a clear growth pattern. Specifically, the demand has increased from an initial baseline of ~100 to nearly 600 units within 6 periods. Between Period 5 and Period 6, there was a significant jump of 139 units (+31%). While the growth rate is aggressive, the last three periods (437, 448, 587) suggest a trajectory that is still accelerating or reaching a high-velocity phase. Given the most recent observation of 587 and the sustained momentum, a forecast reflecting continued growth while slightly tempering the massive jump seen in Period 6 is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward acceleration confirmed through Period 6: Demand has grown from ~250 in Period 2 to ~587 in Period 6, with a recent period-over-period increase of 31%.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and aggressive upward trajectory since Period 2. Historical demand analysis shows a progression of 91, 246, 285, 437, 448, 587, and 637. Computing the period-over-period growth: P4 to P5 (3%), P5 to P6 (31%), and P6 to P7 (8.5%). The average growth rate over the last three periods is approximately 14%. The last two periods (587 to 637) show a gain of 50 units. Given the sustained momentum and the Carry-Over Insights confirming an upward regime shift, the forecast for Period 8 expects continued growth. I will project an increase similar to the most recent absolute gain (+50) while tempering for potential stabilization, resulting in a forecast of 690.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth trend confirmed through Period 7: Demand has increased for 6 consecutive periods, rising from 91 to 637, with a 3-period trailing average of 557.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1756.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is exhibiting a consistent and significant hyper-growth trend. Analyzing the historical sequence from Period 1 to 8: 91, 246, 285, 437, 448, 587, 637, 776. This reflects seven consecutive periods of growth following the initial observation. The absolute growth installments over the last few periods have been +139 (P6), +50 (P7), and +139 (P8). The average growth over the last three periods is approximately 109 units per period. The percentage increase from P7 to P8 was ~21.8%. Given the momentum and the lack of signals for saturation or seasonal tapering, I will project a continuation of this upward trend. Applying the recent growth average (~110-140 units) to the last observed demand of 776 leads to a forecast in the 885-915 range.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth trend continues unabated through Period 8: Demand has increased for 7 consecutive periods, with a 3-period trailing average of 666 and a current 139-unit jump (+22%) in the most recent period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2728.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a hyper-growth regime, exhibiting a consistent upward trend for 8 consecutive periods since Period 1. Historical demand has increased from 91 units to 963 units. Analysis of the delta between periods shows significant acceleration: +155 (P1-P2), +39 (P2-P3), +152 (P3-P4), +11 (P4-P5), +139 (P5-P6), +50 (P6-P7), +139 (P7-P8), and +187 (P8-P9). The 3-period trailing average is 792, while the most recent jump represents a 24% increase. Given the momentum and the increasing magnitude of the deltas in recent periods, particularly the jump from 776 to 963, a continued strong upward trajectory is expected for Period 10, likely pushing the demand past the 1,100 unit mark.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth trend acceleration confirmed through Period 9: Demand has increased for 8 consecutive periods, crossing the 900-unit threshold. Recent period-over-period growth increased to +24%, with a 3-period trailing average now at 792.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2748.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a long-standing hyper-growth trend that saw demand rise from 91 in Period 1 to a peak of 963 in Period 9. However, Period 10 shows the first decline in 9 periods, dropping from 963 to 863 (-10%). This suggests a potential cooldown or a stabilization phase following the aggressive growth. The 3-period trailing average (Periods 8-10) is 867, which is very close to the most recent observation. Given the break in the upward streak, I will forecast a slight stabilization near the current level rather than a continued sharp increase or a deep correction, assuming the market is settling into a high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand stabilization: Period 10 marked the first demand decrease after 8 consecutive periods of growth, suggesting the hyper-growth phase may be transitioning into a high-volume plateau (approx. 850-950 range).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant long-term growth trend, rising from 91 units in Period 1 to 1136 units in Period 11. Although Period 10 showed a temporary dip (863), potentially suggesting stabilization, Period 11 saw a massive rebound to a new all-time high of 1136 (+31.6% WoW). This indicates that the hyper-growth phase has not yet plateaued. The trailing 3-period average is now ~987. Given the volatile but upward momentum, I anticipate another increase, though perhaps more tempered than the last jump as it tests a new thousand-unit baseline.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-growth trend resumed in Period 11: After a single-period dip, demand surged to a new record high of 1136, confirming that the high-volume plateau hypothesized in Period 11 has been breached. The 3-period trailing average has risen to 987.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong hyper-growth trend. Following a brief correction in Period 10 (863), demand surged in Period 11 (1136) and continued to grow in Period 12 to a new record high of 1221. The growth from Period 11 to 12 (+85 units) shows a slight deceleration compared to the massive jump after the Period 10 dip, but the upward momentum remains very strong. Given the 2-period recovery trend following the dip and the historical pattern of consecutive increases, I predict a continued moderate increase for Period 13, targeting the 1300 level.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth confirmed through Period 12: After the temporary dip in Period 10, demand has grown by a total of 358 units over the last two periods, reaching a new peak of 1221 and raising the 3-period trailing average to 1073.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Over the last 13 periods, the demand has grown from 91 units to 1246 units. While the hyper-growth trajectory (which saw frequent double-digit percentage gains) appears to be decelerating slightly (1221 to 1246 is a ~2% increase), the momentum is still positive. The 3-period moving average is 1201, and the current observation is 1246. Despite the slowing growth rate compared to the explosive middle phase, no peak or reversal is yet evident. I expect a modest increase for Period 14 as the trend approaches a potential new plateau.

Carry-over insight: Growth deceleration observed: While the upward trend remains intact, period-over-period growth slowed to ~2% in Period 13 compared to the previous average growth of ~20% during the hyper-growth phase.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive expansion from Period 1 (~91) through Period 14 (1265). We are currently in a phase of significant deceleration following the hyper-growth observed between Periods 3-12. Specifically, the growth rate has dropped from double digits to +2% in Period 13 and +1.5% in Period 14. This indicates the product is likely reaching a market saturation point or a stable high-volume demand plateau. Given the trailing 3-period average (1244) and the consistent but slowing upward momentum, I expect a modest increase for Period 15, continuing the plateauing trend.

Carry-over insight: Growth stabilization confirmed: Period-over-period growth has dropped from ~20% to <2% over the last three periods (12-14), indicating a transition from hyper-growth to a stable high-demand plateau around the 1250-1300 unit range.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a hyper-growth phase into what appeared to be a stable plateau around 1250 units (Periods 12-14). However, Period 15 showed a significant jump to 1507 units (+19% increase), breaking the previously identified stabilization. This suggests either a new upward trend leg or a seasonal surge. The 3-period trailing average (1339) and the 5-period average (1275) both point towards a new, higher baseline. Given the recent momentum after the period of stability, I expect demand to remain at or slightly above this new 1500 level, though I am applying a conservative adjustment to account for the possibility of Period 15 being a localized peak.

Carry-over insight: End of stabilization phase confirmed: Period 15 broke the 1250-1300 plateau with a 19% jump to 1507 units, establishing a new demand ceiling.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its long-term upward trajectory. Historically, this product exhibits a 'step-up' pattern: a significant surge in demand followed by a brief period of stabilization at a new higher plateau. After the plateau at ~1250 units (Periods 12-14), Period 15 saw a major jump to 1507 (+19%). Period 16 (1547) shows the typical deceleration following a surge (+2.7%). Based on previous consolidation phases (like P13-P14), I expect Period 17 to maintain this new high-volume level with a slight upward movement as it stabilizes before the next potential growth phase.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau reached: Demand has sustained levels above 1500 units for two consecutive periods, establishing a new baseline approximately 20% higher than the previous 1250-unit plateau.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term upward trend with periodic transitions between growth and stabilization phases. Historically, demand shifted from a 1250-unit plateau (Periods 12-14) to a 1500-unit plateau (Periods 15-16). Period 17 saw a significant jump of 177 units (+11.4%) to 1724 units. Following the established pattern of this specific series, a jump of this magnitude usually signals the start of a new high-demand baseline or is followed by a small corrective growth period. Given the recent trajectory (1507, 1547, 1724), the current 3-period moving average is 1593. A modest continuation of the upward momentum is expected as it establishes this new regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Demand has crossed the 1700-unit threshold in Period 17, representing a ~13% increase over the previous 1500-1550 plateau established in Periods 15-16.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical analysis shows a strong, sustained upward trend since Period 2. Recently, the demand has transitioned from a plateau around 1250 units (Periods 12-14) to a new range above 1700 units (Periods 17-18). The last four periods (15-18) yielded jumps of +242, +40, +177, and +78 units respectively. This pattern suggests a 'step-up and consolidate' growth behavior. Following the +78 unit increase from Period 17 to 18 (+4.5%) and considering the average absolute increase over the last three periods (~98 units), a forecast in the 1900-unit range is most likely. I will predict 1900 units, reflecting continued but moderating upward momentum as the product seeks a new high-volume ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward momentum confirmed across the 1700-1800 unit range: Period-over-period growth averaged ~6% over the last three periods, successfully establishing a new high-demand ceiling after the previous 1500-unit baseline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained hyper-growth pattern. Following a brief plateau around the 1250-unit range (Periods 12-14), demand has surged again, showing consistent period-over-period growth. Over the last five periods, demand has risen from 1507 to 2075. Most notably, the growth between Period 18 and Period 19 represents a significant 15% jump (273 units), breaking the previously observed slower growth rate of ~5-6%. The 3-period moving average has shifted from ~1690 to ~1867. Given the current momentum and the product's history of breaching newly established plateaus, the forecast anticipates a further increase. I am projecting a moderated 8% growth over the last observed period to account for potential variance while respecting the strong upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Upper-tier hyper-growth acceleration confirmed: Demand has breached the 2000-unit threshold in Period 19 with a 15% period-over-period spike, significantly exceeding the previous 5-6% growth rate observed between Periods 16-18.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a long-term hyper-growth trend, recently breaching the 2000-unit mark in Period 19. Period 20 shows a slight contraction (1973 units), which is a recurring pattern in this dataset (e.g., Period 10) where a significant surge is followed by a minor correction or consolidation before the next leg up. The 3-period trailing average is 1950, and the 5-period average is 1824, indicating the overall momentum remains strongly positive despite the 5% dip in the most recent period. Given the historical behavior where dips are momentary pauses in a larger upward trajectory, I expect demand to stabilize or slightly rebound toward the 2000 level.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent long-term hyper-growth trend, moving from ~91 units in Period 1 to ~2000 units by Period 19. However, the last three periods (19-21) indicate a period of stabilization or a high-volume plateau. Demand peaked at 2075 in Period 19, followed by a minor dip to 1973 (Period 20) and a slight recovery to 1983 (Period 21). This pattern suggests that after the recent 15% jump in Period 19, the market is currently consolidating around the 1950-2000 range. Given the historical pattern where small dips or stalls were followed by either continued plateaus or resumed growth, a conservative forecast sticking to the recent two-period mean (approx. 1978) is appropriate while acknowledging the slight upward movement from Period 20 to 21.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed in the 1950-2050 range: Period-over-period volatility has decreased significantly following the Period 19 peak, with the last 3 periods averaging 2010 units and showing less than 1% growth in the most recent interval.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent long-term upward trajectory. Based on the historical data, there have been various phases of hyper-growth followed by stabilization plateaus. The most recent data shows a significant jump from a plateau in the ~1980 range (Periods 20-21) to a new peak of 2221 in Period 22, representing a 12% increase. This suggests a continuation of the upward-step pattern observed throughout the product lifecycle. Given the transition to this new level, the forecast expects demand to sustain around this new 2200+ baseline, accounting for potential minor stabilization or continued slight momentum.

Carry-over insight: New demand ceiling reached: Period 22 broke the previous 1970-1990 stabilization plateau with a 12% increase to 2221 units, establishing a new high-volume baseline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent long-term upward momentum. Over the last two periods (22 and 23), demand has moved from a stabilization range (approx. 1950-2050) into a new growth phase, reaching 2221 and then 2326 units. This indicates a period-over-period growth of +12.5% in Period 22 and +4.7% in Period 23. While the growth rate has moderated slightly from the initial spike in Period 22, the trend is still clearly positive. I expect demand to continue rising reasonably into Period 24, following the trajectory of the last two periods which averaged roughly 100 units of growth per period.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (Periods 22-23): Demand has shifted from a 2000-unit plateau to a new baseline above 2200 units, with a 2-period average of 2273 compared to the previous 3-period average of 2010 (+13%).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent hyper-growth pattern throughout the observation window, frequently characterized by steps and subsequent accelerations. Following a stabilization period around 2000 units (Periods 19-21), demand has entered a new growth phase over the last three periods: 2221 (+12%), 2326 (+4.7%), and 2566 (+10.3%). The current 3-period trailing average is 2371, significantly higher than the previous baseline. Given the strong momentum in Period 24 (+240 units), I expect demand to follow the established trend of continued growth as it tests a new ceiling, likely approaching the 2700-2800 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward momentum confirmed Periods 22-24: Demand has transitioned from a 2000-unit plateau to a rapid growth corridor, increasing by 15.5% over the last three periods to reach a new peak of 2566.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a long-term upward trend. Analyzing the most recent period (Period 25), the demand grew to 2604 units, a 1.5% increase following the 10.3% surge observed in Period 24. This pattern follows historical behavior where large jumps (like those in Periods 15, 17, 19, and 24) are followed by small-percentage growth or stabilization for 1-2 periods before the next significant shift. The 3-period trailing average is now 2498. Given the slight deceleration in growth from Period 24 to 25 (+38 units), I anticipate an incremental increase for Period 26 to remain within the current 2600-2700 unit channel, reflecting continued but slowing momentum.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau reached in Periods 24-25: Demand has stabilized above the 2550-unit threshold, establishing a new high-volume baseline approximately 15% higher than the previous 2200-2300 level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its long-term upward trend, recently transitioning into a new high-volume plateau. Following the hyper-growth observed between Periods 21 and 24 (2221 to 2566), the last three periods (24, 25, 26) show a marked stabilization in the 2550-2650 range, with demand figures of 2566, 2604, and 2645 respectively. The period-over-period growth has slowed significantly from double digits to roughly 1.5% in the most recent interval. This pattern suggests a shift from a growth corridor to a high-demand baseline. For Period 27, I expect the demand to follow this minor upward drift within the established plateau, leading to a forecast slightly higher than Period 26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Historically, the product has transitioned through several plateaus (1250, 1500, 2000, 2250, and most recently 2600). The last three periods (25-27) show a clear breakout from the ~2600 plateau: Period 25 (2604), Period 26 (2645), and Period 27 (2890). The recent jump of 245 units (+9.3%) in Period 27 suggests a transition to a new demand regime nearing the 3000-unit mark. Given the momentum of this 'hyper-growth' pattern seen in previous cycles, I expect the demand to follow this upward trajectory. My forecast weights the recent acceleration heavily while accounting for the established pattern of periodic sharp increases followed by brief consolidations.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed in Period 27: Demand has broken out of the 2600-unit plateau with a 9% spike to 2890 units, establishing a new probable baseline in the 2850-3000 range.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term hyper-growth trend with periodic steps into higher plateaus. Recently, the demand reached a new peak of 2890 in Period 27 before pulling back to 2643 in Period 28. Historically, Period 10 and Period 20 also showed single-period dips following strong growth, which were immediately followed by a resumption of the upward trajectory or stabilization at the higher level. The current 3-period moving average is 2726, while the 5-period average is 2670. Given the established pattern of reaching a 2600-unit baseline (Periods 24-26) and the breakout in Period 27, the dip in Period 28 is likely a correction rather than a trend reversal. I expect demand to rebound towards the 2750-2850 range as it stabilizes within the new regime identified in the carry-over insights.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, characterized by brief stabilization plateaus followed by upward breakouts. Most recently, Period 27 established a new peak at 2890. Periods 28 and 29 showed a slight correction (2643) and then a recovery (2814), respectively. This pattern resembles the stabilization observed in Periods 20-21 and 24-26, where demand oscillates before pushing higher. The 3-period moving average is currently 2782. Given the recovery in Period 29 and the historical trend of returning to or exceeding previous peaks, I anticipate demand will trend back toward the high-water mark of ~2900 set in Period 27. The forecast conservatively targets the upper end of the recent oscillation range (2643-2890) reflecting the sustained upward momentum noted in Carry-over Insights.

Carry-over insight: New demand stabilization zone confirmed: Since Period 27, demand has fluctuated within the 2640-2900 range, consistently maintaining a new baseline approximately 7% higher than the previous Period 24-26 plateau (~2600).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has moved into a stabilization zone between 2600 and 2900 units, as noted in the Carry-over Insights for Period 30. Looking at the last four periods (27-30), demand has been: 2890, 2643, 2814, and 2873. The 3-period trailing average is 2777, and the most recent demand (2873) shows a return toward the upper bound of this range. There is no clear evidence of a new breakout trend, but rather a consistent fluctuating plateau. Given the slight momentum over the last two periods (growing from 2643 to 2814 to 2873), I expect the demand to remain near the upper end of the established range for Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11409.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a continued upward trajectory. After a stabilization phase in the 2600-2900 range (Periods 27-30), Period 31 saw a new peak of 3046 units, breaking the previous ceiling. This represents a 6% increase from the Period 30 value and confirms that the product has entered a new demand regime above 3000 units. Historically, shifts like this have been followed by sustained maintenance of the new level or further incremental growth. Given the strength of the move in Period 31 and the consistent historical pattern of upward baseline shifts, I am forecasting a slight continuation of this momentum for Period 32.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed in Period 31: Demand has breached the 3000-unit threshold (3046), marking a move out of the previous 2640-2900 stabilization zone established in Periods 27-30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9747.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently transitioning out of the Period 27-30 stabilization zone (avg ~2805) into a new higher-volume regime. Period 31 breached the 3000-unit mark (3046), and Period 32 consolidated this gain with a demand of 3005. Historically, this product exhibits rapid growth phases followed by short plateaus. The current 3-period trailing average (P30-P32) is approximately 2975. Given the established pattern of breaking through previous resistance levels and stabilizing at higher baselines, I expect demand to follow this upward trajectory or maintain the new 3000+ floor. A slight upward bias from the current 2-period average (3025) is projected as the product enters this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed in Period 32: Demand has successfully established a baseline above 3000 units for two consecutive periods, moving out of the previous 2640-2900 stabilization zone.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting a long-term hyper-growth trajectory with frequent periodic shifts to higher demand plateaus. Recent history shows a move from the 2600-2900 range (Periods 27-30) into a new regime above 3000 units starting at Period 31. Period 33 show a significant jump of approximately 13% (+386 units) from the previous period, reaching an all-time high of 3391. This matches previous patterns where a stabilization is followed by a sharp breakout. Given the sustained momentum seen in the last three periods (3046, 3005, 3391), the forecast anticipates a slight continuation or high-level consolidation near the most recent peak, while acknowledging that rapid growth often sees a dampening effect immediately following a large spike.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed in Period 33: Demand has spiked to levels above 3300, breaking out of the 3000-3050 mini-plateau seen in Periods 31-32 and representing a 12% increase from the previous 3-period average.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a long-term hyper-growth trajectory, recently transitioning through several plateaus (2000, 2300, 2600, 2800). Following a breakout at Period 31, demand established a new baseline above 3000. In Periods 33 and 34, demand surged again to a higher plateau in the 3350-3400 range (3391 and 3368 respectively). History shows that after significant spikes, the product often experiences a brief period of consolidation or minor fluctuation at the new level before the next growth phase. Given that Period 34 showed a very slight decline (-23 units) compared to Period 33, I expect demand to remain stable within this new high-volume zone.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed in the 3350-3400 range: After breaking the 3000-unit mark in period 31, demand has stabilized at a level approximately 12% higher than the previous Period 27-30 average.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term hyper-growth trend characterized by successive plateaus and breakouts. Most recently, the demand established a new high-volume plateau in the 3300-3400 range (Periods 33-34) after breaking the 3000-unit mark. However, Period 35 shows a slight decline to 3282, which is approximately 2.5% below the average of the previous two periods (3379.5). Given the historical pattern of brief stabilization or minor dips before either maintaining a plateau or initiating a new breakout, the forecast assumes the demand will remain within the established 3300-3400 stabilization zone but adjusts slightly downward to mirror the most recent momentum shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12863.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has moved through a series of step-ups and stabilization plateaus. Since Period 33, demand has largely stabilized within a new high-volume corridor between 3280 and 3450 units. Specifically, the last four periods (33-36) recorded demands of 3391, 3368, 3282, and 3448, averaging 3372 units. While Period 36 showed a slight uptick (+5% vs Period 35), the overall trend indicates a stabilization phase rather than a new hyper-growth breakout. No significant calendar events are provided, so the forecast is based on the current 4-period moving average and the established plateau. Expect demand to remain within this established high-volume range.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed in the 3300-3450 range: Following the breakout in Period 33, demand has maintained an average of 3372 over the last 4 periods, representing a consistent level ~15% higher than the Period 27-30 average.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has demonstrated a consistent multi-regime upward trend. Most recently, the product transitioned from a stabilization zone of 3300-3450 (observed from Periods 33-36) into a potential new growth surge. Period 37 saw a significant 8.7% spike to 3748, which follows the historical pattern where demand plateaus for 3-4 periods before breaking out to a new baseline. Over the last 5 periods (33-37), the average demand is 3447, but the last two periods show 3448 and 3748, indicating upward momentum. Given this established pattern of breakout spikes followed by consolidation near the new peak, the forecast for Period 38 anticipates a slight cooling or consolidation around the 3800 level, continuing the upward trajectory but adjusting for the typical post-spike stabilization.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed in Period 37: Demand surged to 3748, breaking the previous 3300-3450 plateau and indicating a potential shift toward a 3700-3800 baseline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data for 'chips(Regular)' shows a continued and significant upward trajectory. After maintaining a plateau in the 3300-3450 range (Periods 33-36), demand broke out in Period 37 (3748) and accelerated further in Period 38 (3929), representing a 4.8% increase in the most recent period. The moving average has shifted upward significantly: the last 3 periods average 3708, while the last 2 periods average 3838. Given the persistent historical pattern of this SKU moving from one high-volume plateau to another through growth spurts, and the fact that we are currently in an 'acceleration' phase after breaking the 3500-unit ceiling, I expect demand to continue its upward momentum toward the 4000-4100 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward acceleration confirmed (Periods 37-38): Demand has risen for two consecutive periods after breaking the 3300-3450 plateau, reaching a new peak of 3929 and increasing the 2-period average to 3838 (+14% over the previous plateau).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
(1) Historical pattern summary: The product 'chips(Regular)' has exhibited a distinct stair-step hyper-growth pattern since Period 1. (2) Seasonal/calendar considerations: No specific external calendar events are provided, but the trend implies high positive momentum. (3) Recent trend analysis: Over the last three periods (37-39), demand has accelerated from 3748 to 4212, representing a 12.4% increase over just two intervals. Period 39 saw a significant jump of 283 units (+7.2%) reaching a new all-time high. (4) Final forecast logic: The trend is currently in a breakout phase above the previous 3800-3900 level. Given the consistent 5-8% growth rate over the last few periods, I expect demand to continue rising, likely to the 4400-4500 range, following the established momentum.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime breakout confirmed (Periods 37-39): Demand has risen for three consecutive periods, breaking the 4000-unit threshold for the first time. The current 3-period average is 3963, a 17% increase over the Period 33-36 plateau of ~3372.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a state of sustained hyper-growth. Analysis of the historical data shows that after a period of stabilization around 3300-3450 (Periods 33-36), demand broke out in Period 37 and has increased for four consecutive periods (3748 -> 3929 -> 4212 -> 4461). The growth rates for the last three periods were approximately +4.8%, +7.2%, and +5.9%, respectively. The current 3-period trailing average is 4200 units. Given the consistent upward momentum and the absence of plateau signals in the most recent periods, I anticipate a continued increase. Applying a conservative growth factor of approximately 5.5% to the most recent observation (4461) suggests a forecast in the 4700 range.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-growth acceleration (Periods 37-40): Demand has increased for four consecutive periods, rising from 3448 to 4461 units (+29% total growth). This confirms a definitive breakout from the previous 3300-3450 plateau and marks transition into a 4000+ unit demand regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant period of hyper-growth. Between Period 36 and Period 40, demand climbed from 3448 to 4461 units, marking four consecutive periods of growth. In Period 41, demand experienced a correction, dropping to 4166 units (-6.6%). This pattern mirror historical 'mini-plateaus' or technical pullbacks seen previously (e.g., Period 10, Period 20, Period 28, and Period 32), where a single-period dip followed a strong rally before growth resumed or stabilized at a new high-volume baseline. Given the 3-period trailing average is currently 4280 and the 5-period average is 4103, the demand is likely to either stabilize or see a slight recovery as it establishes a new regime above the 4000-unit threshold. I forecast a slight rebound toward the recent average, accounting for the possibility that Period 41 was a temporary variance in an ongoing upward trend.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime stabilization confirmed (Periods 39-41): Despite a single-period dip in Period 41, demand has remained above the 4100-unit mark for three consecutive periods, establishing a new baseline approximately 23% higher than the Period 33-36 plateau of ~3372.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is characterized by a strong long-term upward trend punctuated by short-term stabilization phases. The most recent sequence (Periods 37-40) saw a rapid climb from 3748 to 4461 units. However, Periods 41 and 42 have shown a cooling-off effect, with demand decreasing to 4166 and then 4040. Historically, following a major peak (e.g., Periods 19, 27, and 33), the product enters a brief consolidation phase or minor dip before either resuming growth or establishing a new plateau. The current decline over the last two periods (-6.6% then -3.0%) suggests a similar stabilization. I anticipate the demand will remain within the 4000-4100 range as it finds a new support level above the previous Period 33-36 plateau (~3372).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime stabilization confirmed (Periods 39-42): Despite a two-period decline from the Period 40 peak, demand has remained above the 4000-unit mark for four consecutive periods, establishing a new baseline approximately 20% higher than the Period 33-36 plateau.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a high-volume plateau. After a peak of 4,461 in Period 40, demand has declined for three consecutive periods (41-43), settling at 3,950 units. This pattern indicates a cooling off from the hyper-growth phase into a new stable range. The carry-over insights suggest a baseline has been established above 4,000, though the most recent observation (3,950) is slightly below this. The trailing 3-period average is 4,052, and the 5-period average is 4,166. Given the consistent but decelerating decline over the last three periods (-295, -126, -90 units respectively), the rate of decline is slowing. I forecast a stabilization around the 3,900-4,000 level for Period 44.

Carry-over insight: New demand stabilization confirmed (Periods 41-43): Following the Period 40 peak of 4,461, demand has corrected and stabilized within the 3,950-4,150 range, establishing a secondary plateau approximately 17% higher than the Period 33-36 average.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has historically exhibited a strong upward trend, transitioning through several growth phases and plateaus. Recent history shows a significant peak at Period 40 (4461), followed by a minor correction and stabilization period (Periods 41-43) where demand ranged from 3950 to 4166. However, Period 44 saw a sharp rebound to 4444 units, nearly reaching the previous all-time high. This suggests that the stabilization phase has ended and the upward momentum is resuming. The 3-period trailing average is currently 4144, but the most recent jump of ~12.5% (494 units) indicates strong immediate momentum. I expect demand for Period 45 to stay near this new high-volume level, likely slightly higher as it tests the previous peak resistance.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed in Period 44: After a three-period stabilization in the 3950-4150 range, demand surged to 4444 (+12.5% PoP), returning to near peak levels and signaling a resumption of the upward trend.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term hyper-growth trend with periodic stabilization phases. Following a peak in Period 40 (4,461) and a subsequent correction to the 3,950-4,150 range, Periods 44 and 45 have seen demand return to near-peak levels (4,444 and 4,364 respectively). The current 2-period average (4,404) is significantly higher than the previous stabilization average (~4,050), suggesting a new high-volume plateau is forming near the previous all-time high. Given the slight cooling in Period 45 from Period 44, a forecast that respects this current high-volume level while allowing for minor variance is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand plateau confirmed (Periods 44-45): Demand has returned to the 4,350-4,450 range after a brief correction, representing a new stabilization level near previous peak performance.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term upward trend, recently transitioning from a stabilization zone in the 3950-4150 range to a new high-volume plateau. Over the last three periods (44-46), demand has consistently remained above 4300, specifically recording 4444, 4364, and 4530. This suggests a new baseline around 4450. The period-over-period change from Period 45 to 46 was an increase of approximately 3.8%. Given the recent momentum and the pattern of establishing stabilized plateaus after breakout periods, I expect demand to remain in this upper range with a slight positive bias as the market settles into this new regime.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime established (Periods 44-46): Demand has stabilized in the 4350-4550 range, representing a ~10% increase over the previous secondary plateau of ~4050 units found in Periods 41-43.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical data shows a long-term upward trend with periodic stabilization plateaus. Recently, demand shifted from a level around 4000 units (Periods 41-43) to a higher plateau between 4350 and 4600 units (Periods 44-47). The most recent observations (4530 in Period 46 and 4595 in Period 47) indicate that demand is currently testing the upper bound of this new range. Given the slight upward momentum over the last two periods (growth of ~1.4%), the forecast expects demand to remain within this established high-volume regime with a modest continued increase toward the 4650 level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17212.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a persistent long-term upward trend characterized by periodic stabilization followed by breakouts. Most recently, Period 48 saw a significant jump to 4776 (+3.9%), breaking the previous stabilization plateau of 4350-4550 units identified in Period 47. Over the last three periods (46-48), demand has increased consistently (4530, 4595, 4776), with an average period-over-period growth of approximately 2.7%. Given this sustained upward momentum and the breakout from the previous ceiling, the forecast for Period 49 anticipates continued growth at a similar rate, projecting the demand into the 4900-4950 range.

Carry-over insight: New demand breakout confirmed in Period 48: Demand reached 4776, breaking the 4350-4550 plateau and establishing a new high-volume baseline with three consecutive periods of growth.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM Demand Forecast:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new hyper-growth phase after breaking out of the 4350-4550 plateau. Observed demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P46-P49), recently breaching the 5,000-unit threshold. Specifically, the growth rate accelerated from +3.9% in Period 48 to +6.5% in Period 49. Given the historical pattern of this SKU to sustain momentum once a new ceiling is broken (as seen in the Period 37-41 run), I expect continued upward movement. A conservative continuation of the recent growth trend (~5-6%) suggests the next demand point will fall in the 5300-5400 range.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime breakout confirmed in Period 50: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods, breaching the 5,000-unit threshold for the first time. The current 3-period average (P47-P49) is 4819 units, representing a 10% increase over the previous 4350-4550 plateau.
