Based on the historical demand samples provided [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand is 111.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack with relatively stable demand, though potentially affected by weekends or local events (dates are generic Period_1 for now). Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the same period and be available to satisfy demand. To maximize reward while avoiding stockouts on the first day, I will target the high end of the historical range. Since current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I need to order enough for this period's demand.

Given that the profit per unit ($4.0) is 4x higher than the holding cost ($1.0) and that we have experienced lost sales due to stockouts in the last three periods (ending inventory 0), I am setting the forecast for Period 25 to 2750 units to both meet the growing demand and establish a small buffer.",
