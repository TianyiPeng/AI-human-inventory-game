Historical samples show an average demand of 111.4 units (samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94). Step 2: Demand Regime Analysis - Since this is Period 1, I rely on historical samples. The range is 94-138. I will forecast a baseline of ~115 units per period. Step 3: Lead Time & Pipeline - Promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed now (P1) arrives in P3 (visible at P4 start). To maintain service levels, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). Step 4: Inventory Assessment - On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Total pipeline requirement = Expected Demand * (L+1) + Safety Stock. Step 5: Order Logic - To cover 3 periods of demand at ~115/period plus a small safety buffer for variance (given P1 start at 0 inventory), I will order 360 units. This targets a healthy opening stock once the shipment arrives in P3.",
