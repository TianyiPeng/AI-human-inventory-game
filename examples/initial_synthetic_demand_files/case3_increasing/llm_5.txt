The average of these samples is 111.4 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My ordering strategy must cover the demand for the lead time (L) plus the current period (L+1), which equals 5 periods (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I need to place a large initial order to establish a pipeline that meets this expected demand. Calculating for 5 periods at an average of ~112 units per period gives a baseline requirement of 560 units. I will order 560 units to ensure that once the lead time passes, the machine is sufficiently stocked to meet the average demand without excessive stockouts in the early game, while acknowledging that the first arrival won't occur until Period 5 at the earliest.",
