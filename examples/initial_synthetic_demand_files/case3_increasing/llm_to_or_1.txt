Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. The past demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows five data points: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments yet, and the promised lead time is 4, we need to establish a baseline order that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level according to the OR engine's formula. I will use the default promised lead time (4) as the starting point for L.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 91. Since the on-hand inventory was 0 and the order hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time is 4), we had 0 sales. Current on-hand is 0, and 141 units are in-transit. The historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the Period 1 demand of 91 suggests a relatively stable demand regime with a mean around 108. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, our replenishment cycle covers L+1 = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the new Period 1 data) to capture the current demand mean and volatility. Since we have no concluded arrivals yet, I will stick with the promised lead time 'default'.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders placed (Period 1 or 2) could have arrived yet if the promised lead time holds (P1 order would arrive in P5 at the earliest). Demand has shown a significant spike in Period 2 (246) compared to Period 1 (91) and historical data (avg ~111), suggesting a potential regime shift or high volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 279 units in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher recent figures (n=2 for the available periods), while keeping the lead time at its promised default until arrival data suggests otherwise. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect the increased standard deviation from the recent demand volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The initial demand data (91, 246, 285) shows a sharp upward trend compared to the provided pre-game history (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant lost sales (sold=0), indicating stockouts. The promised lead time is 4. Given the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4 sequence: order P1 -> arrive P1+4=P5). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in periods 1-3 is expected behavior for L=4. Since we have zero inventory and rising demand, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the base-stock level accounts for the current demand spike while we wait for the pipeline (569 units) to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The history shows orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) have not yet arrived as of the Period 4 conclude message. Since arrival happens during the arrival resolution phase of Period 1+L, an order with L=4 placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, there is no evidence yet that the lead time has deviated from the promised 4 periods. However, demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last 5 samples (including pre-game history: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94; and game history: 91, 246, 285, 437). The mean demand from the last 3 game periods is significantly higher (approx 322) compared to the initial samples. To ensure the base stock covers the (L+1) period horizon (5 days), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this surge, while maintaining the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The Period 5 conclude message confirms the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (141 units), validating the promised lead time. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 1294 units in-transit. Demand has shown a significant upward trend: 91, 246, 285, 437, 448 (last 5 samples). The mean of the last 3 samples is 390. To calculate mu_hat, we use (1+L) * mean_demand. With L=4, mu_hat = 5 * 390 = 1950. For sigma_hat, we use the standard deviation of the last 4 samples (as they better represent the current high-demand regime) multiplied by sqrt(1+L). The std of [246, 285, 437, 448] is approximately 104. sqrt(5) * 104 is approx 232. Using recent_N for both allows the backend to capture this growth phase while maintaining the logic's integrity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~400 units over the first 5 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing a situation where demand has rapidly scaled and we are currently out of stock due to the lead time delay. Demand history shows [91, 246, 285, 437, 448, 587], clearly reflecting a sharp upward trend or shift. The mean of the last 3 periods is approximately 490 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 and the Period 2 order in Period 6. Since the demand is still increasing (587 in Period 6), using a simple mean of all samples would underestimate needs. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~490 units/period). This results in a mu_hat covering L+1 (5) periods. Explicit L is set to the promised 4 to ensure the OR backend uses the confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand increased from ~100 to ~490 units over the last 6 periods; Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1160.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe a sustained upward trend in demand for chips(Regular). Over the last 4 periods, demand has risen from 437 to 637 units (P4: 437, P5: 448, P6: 587, P7: 637), averaging approximately 527 units. The last three periods specifically average 557 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals (governed by a consistent lead time of 4 periods) are consistently lower than the surging demand. The in-transit pipeline (2056 units) contains orders from P4-P7. Given the promised lead time of 4 is holding steady, my target stock must cover demand during the lead time + the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since demand is clearly trending upward rather than being stable at a new mean, I will use an explicit forecast of 600 units per period to ensure the base stock calculation prevents further stockouts. mu_hat is set to (1+4)*600 = 3000. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(5)*100 = 224 to account for the increased volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth continues: the last 3 periods average 557 units, indicating a stronger upward trend than the previous regime shift suggested.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is experiencing a strong, sustained upward demand trend. Historical demand for the last five periods (P4-P8) has been 437, 448, 587, 637, and 776, showing a rapid increase that exceeds earlier averages. In the last 3 periods, demand averaged 666 units. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and confirmed actual lead time (L=4 from P1-P4 arrivals), the current in-transit inventory (2444) plus on-hand (0) must cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand is accelerating too fast for the global mean or a simple recent_N average to capture without significant stockouts. Therefore, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat based on an expected average demand of 800 units over the next 5 periods (800 * 5 = 4000). I am also using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility accompanying this growth, setting it at roughly 20% of the mu_hat to ensure the OR backend maintains a higher base stock level to prevent recurrent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~400 (P4-P5) to ~666 (P6-P8), a 66% increase in 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1956.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. Looking at the last four periods (P6-P9), demands were 587, 637, 776, and 963, showing a consistent upward trend. The mean of the last 3 periods is ~792, but the most recent period (P9) reached 963. Given the growth trend, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast. I project next period demand at ~1100. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using an average demand of ~1200 across those 5 periods to stay ahead of the curve, mu_hat = 5 * 1200 = 6000. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 800 to account for high volatility during this growth phase. The lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains exponential: P9 demand (963) is 50% higher than P7 (637). Current pipeline inventory must be maintained at higher levels to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2244.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a powerful upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P6-P10) averaging 765 units. Current ending inventory remains at 0, indicating chronic stockouts due to underestimating the growth rate during the 4-period lead time. Significant order increases in P9 (984) and P10 (1789) are currently in-transit and will begin arriving in P13 and P14 respectively. For Period 11, the immediate concern is that the incoming shipment (from P7) is only 629 units, which is unlikely to satisfy current demand levels (P10 demand was 863). To stay ahead of this growth, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most aggressive growth phase (P8-P10 avg = 867) and multiplying it by (1+L) to set the base stock level. I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: last 3 periods average 867 units, a 35% increase over the previous 5-period average of 642. The system consistently exhausts stock on arrival, suggesting the growth rate exceeds the OR engine's standard replenishment logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2516.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience rapid exponential demand growth. The last 3 periods (P9-P11) have seen demands of 963, 863, and 1136, averaging 987 units per period. This is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average. Historically, arrivals have consistently been exhausted immediately (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for all periods), indicating that we are under-ordering relative to the actual realized demand because the OR engine relies on historical stats which tag behind this trend. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). To account for the continuing growth and prevent further lost sales, I will use an 'explicit' value for mu_hat. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to 5500 (representing a forecast of 1100 per period for the next 5 periods) to get ahead of the current trend of ~1000 units/period. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high volatility observed during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P11 demand (1136) is the highest yet. Average demand for P9-P11 is 987, vs P6-P8 average of 666 (+48% increase). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit rapid growth, with the most recent sample (Period 12) reaching 1221 units, a 41% increase over the demand from three periods ago (Period 9: 863). The average demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) is 1073.3 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently stocking out upon arrival, I must set the forecast (mu_hat) to capture this upward trajectory to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time + review period (1+L = 5 periods). An explicit mu_hat of 6500 (representing a forward-looking average of 1300 per period * 5) is used to stay ahead of the growth curve. Sigma is set to a higher explicit value of 800 to account for the increasing volatility associated with this growth scale.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P12 demand (1221) continues the rapid upward trend with a 3-period average (P10-P12) of 1073 units, compared to the previous 3-period average of 867 (+24%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3936.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit exponential growth. The last 5 periods' demand [963, 863, 1136, 1221, 1246] averages 1085.8 units, while the last 3 periods [1136, 1221, 1246] average 1201 units, showing that the growth trend is persisting. The system is consistently stocking out upon arrival because demand is outpacing the historical mean. To capture the current growth, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the highest demand levels. The lead time (L) is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages from P1-P9 (all 4 periods). Setting mu_hat to the average of the last 3 periods (1201 * (1+L) = 6005) ensures the base stock calculation targets the most recent aggressive demand regime, mitigating stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P11-P13 average demand is 1201 units, representing an 80% increase compared to the P6-P8 average of 666. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4536.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive growth, with Period 14 reaching a new high of 1265 units. The 3-period average (P12-P14) is now 1244 units, a significant increase from the P9-P11 average of 987 (+26%). In Period 14, for the first time in many periods, we ended with on-hand inventory (524 units) because the large order from Period 10 (1789 units) arrived. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the sustained hyper-growth, I will use an 'explicit' Mu_hat to forecast demand across the L+1 window (5 periods). I project demand to grow from 1265 to an average of roughly 1450 over the next 5 periods. Therefore, Mu_hat = 1450 * 5 = 7250. This aggressive setting ensures the OR engine maintains a sufficient pipeline to meet the surging demand. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this latest high-growth regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P12-P14 average demand is 1244 units, representing a 26% increase over the P9-P11 average of 987.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an aggressive upward trend, with Period 15 demand reaching 1,507 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P13-P15) is 1,339 units, compared to 1,073 units for P10-P12 (+25%). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current period is 16 and lead time is 4, we must cover demand through Period 20 (L+1 periods). My previous orders (in-transit) are catching up, but because demand is consistently outpacing the simple moving average used by the OR engine, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I project demand for the next 5 periods will average 1,550 units per period (reflecting the sustained growth), requiring a mu_hat of 1,550 * 5 = 7,750. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P13-P15 average demand is 1,339 units, a 25% increase over the P10-P12 average of 1,073.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5312.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extremely aggressive upward trend. Specifically, the demand in Period 16 reached 1,547, and the average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) is 1,439.7 units, which is significantly higher than the previous three-period average (P11-P13) of 1,201 units. We are consistently hitting zero ending inventory or selling out immediately upon arrival, indicating that the standard logic is lagging behind the market growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover (1+L) * 1650 units (a conservative forecast based on current growth momentum). For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 250 * sqrt(5) to account for high volatility during this growth phase. The 'recent_N' method for N=3 would yield a mu_hat of ~7200, which is slightly more conservative than my explicit forecast, but given the current trajectory, an explicit forecast is necessary to build a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P14-P16 average demand is 1,440 units, a 20% increase over the P11-P13 average of 1,201. The product consistently stocks out, suggesting the growth rate continues to outpace lead-time-adjusted averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6731.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit exponential growth. Over the last three cycles (P15-P17), demand averaged 1,593 units per period, a 19% increase from the P12-P14 average of 1,339. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the P13 order in P17. Given that the lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). A simple average would lag significantly behind this trend. I will use 'explicit' values to project demand forward: based on the ~20% growth rate observed every 3 periods, I forecast an average demand of 1,650 units per period for the next lead-time window. This results in mu_hat = 1,650 * (4 + 1) = 8,250. This aggressive forecasting is necessary to build the pipeline inventory needed to meet future demand and move beyond the current pattern of constant stockouts (sold = on-hand). Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of demand to account for the high volatility accompanying this rapid growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P15-P17 average demand is 1,593 units, a 19% increase over the P12-P14 average of 1,339. The growth rate is consistently outpacing historical averages, necessitating forward-looking explicit parameters.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive exponential growth, reaching 1,802 units in Period 18. The 3-period average (P16-P18) is 1,691, representing a ~17% increase over the previous three-period average (P13-P15) of 1,439. To address this, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand at a level that anticipates continued growth during the lead time. Given the current trend, I project demand will exceed 1,850 units per period. With L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods (L+1). A conservative forward-looking estimate for mu_hat is 5 * 1,900 = 9,500. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility associated with this rapid growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P16-P18 average demand is 1,691 units, a 17% increase over the P13-P15 average of 1,439. Projected demand for upcoming periods is >1,850 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6892.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit exponential growth. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), demand has shifted from 1,724 up to 2,075, with an average of 1,867. This represents a 17% increase over the previous three-period average. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Because the system is consistently stocking out (ending on-hand inventory is 0 in almost every period) and the demand is accelerating faster than simple averages can track, I am setting explicit parameters to anticipate the demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I estimate the pending demand per period will average approximately 2,100 units. Thus, mu_hat is set to 10,500 (2,100 * 5). Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the volatility seen in this aggressive growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and accelerating: P17-P19 average demand is 1,867 units, a 17% increase over the P14-P16 average of 1,593. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7116.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Period 20 demand was 1973, slightly down from Period 19's peak of 2075, but the 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1950 units. Comparing P18-P20 (avg 1950) to P15-P17 (avg 1593) shows a 22% increase over just 3 periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the replenishment cycle must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Given the current trend, I forecast average demand for the next 5 periods at approximately 2150 units/period (reflecting the sustained ~15-20% growth seen in historical increments). This results in a required base stock (mu_hat) of 10,750 (5 * 2150). Current in-transit inventory is 9375. Operating at 0 on-hand inventory confirms we are still under-ordering relative to realized demand. I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure the OR backend can respond to this growth, as historical-mean methods (recent_N) are lagging behind the actual ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P18-P20 average demand is 1,950 units, a 22% increase over the P15-P17 average of 1,593. Forecast for the next 5 periods is ~2,150 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7853.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory. The recent 3-period average demand (P19-P21) is approximately 2,010 units, representing a 5.4% increase over the previous 3-period average (P16-P18: 1,907). In Period 21, demand reached 1,983, and the system is still barely meeting demand with arrivals from Period 17. Given the consistent ~15-20% growth observed every 3-4 periods throughout the history, I am forecasting a mean demand of 2,150 units per period for the current and lead-time window (next 5 periods). This forward-looking 'explicit' mu_hat of 10,750 (representing (1+L=5) * 2,150) is necessary to ensure the OR engine orders enough to keep pace with the acceleration, as historical averages lag significantly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'Period N-4' fulfillment seen in the game history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this high-growth regime without being skewed by the much lower variance of the early game.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P19-P21 average demand is 2,010 units, a 26% increase over the P14-P16 average of 1,593. Upward trend continues significantly above early-game levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Period 22 demand was 2,221 units, setting a new peak. The average demand of the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is 2,059 units, compared to the P17-P19 average of 1,867, representing a 10% increase over that short window. To prevent stockouts during the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5), we must project demand forward. Estimating a conservative 10% growth for the next cycle suggests a mean demand of approximately 2,250 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 11,250 (5 * 2,250) ensures the base stock covers projected demand, while increasing sigma_hat to 500 (approx. sqrt(5) * 225) accounts for the high variability associated with this rapid growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P20-P22 average demand is 2,059 units, confirming a sustained upward trend from the previous 1,867 average (+10%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8752.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a strong upward growth regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is 2176.7, compared to the previous 3-period average of 1950. The demand for Period 23 reached 2326, its highest point yet. Because demand consistently exceeds historical averages by the time orders arrive (L=4), I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters reflect the current momentum rather than lagging historical means. I am setting the forward-looking mean to 2400 per period. Over the (1+L) = 5 period horizon, this results in mu_hat = 12000. I am maintaining a volatility estimate (sigma_hat) of 750 (scaled to the lead time window) to manage the variance in this high-growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P21-P23 average demand is 2,177 units, a 12% increase over the P18-P20 average of 1,950. Period 23 peak demand (2,326) represents a new high. Growth continues to trend at ~5-10% every 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend, with the last 3 periods averaging 2,371 units (P22: 2221, P23: 2326, P24: 2566). Period 24 demand is the highest recorded yet. Comparison of 3-period rolling averages confirms a consistent growth: P180-20 (1,950 units) to P22-24 (2,371 units), representing a 21% increase. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need to cover (L+1) periods of demand, I must forecast ahead to prevent stockouts. I expect demand for the next 5 periods to average approximately 2,750 units. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 2,750 * 5 = 13,750. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the last 5 periods (approx 220) scaled by sqrt(5), leading to ~492. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P22-P24 average demand is 2,371 units, a 21% increase over the P18-P20 average of 1,950 units. Period 24 demand (2,566) reached a new peak, confirming the acceleration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9188.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive and sustained growth. The most recent demand (Period 25) hit 2604 units, with a 3-period average (P23-P25) of 2498 units, representing a 15% increase over the previous 3-period average of 2177 units. To meet this trajectory, I am using 'explicit' parameters for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Considering the promised and confirmed lead time (L=4), we must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I project demand for the next 5 periods to be approximately 2,800 units per period on average, totaling 14,000 units for mu_hat. I am also increasing sigma_hat to 1,200 to account for the high volatility accompanying this exponential growth and to ensure the backend creates a sufficiently high base stock to prevent the ongoing stockouts seen in Periods 23 and 25.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P23-P25 average demand is 2,498 units, a 15% increase over the P21-P23 average of 2,177. Current demand trajectory suggests mean demand will exceed 2,700 units/period immediately.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive exponential growth. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 2,645 units, and the average of the last three periods (P24-P26) is 2,605 units. Comparing this to the P21-P23 average of 2,177 units reveals a 20% increase over just three periods. Based on this trajectory, I forecast the mean demand for the upcoming lead time (L=4) and review period to be at least 2,900 units per period. Setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+4) * 2,900 = 14,500 ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for this continued acceleration. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the system has consistently hit stockouts (on-hand is 0), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 600 (scaled by sqrt(5)) to capture the increasing volatility inherent in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P24-P26 average demand is 2,605 units, a 20% increase over the P21-P23 average of 2,177. Forecast for next 5 periods is ~2,900 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit aggressive growth. Period 27 demand reached 2,890 units, affirming the upward trajectory noted in previous periods. The average demand for the last three periods (P25-P27) is 2,713 units, compared to the P22-P24 average of 2,371 units, representing a 14.4% increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the review plus lead time (1+4=5 periods) while accounting for this growth, I am forecasting an average demand of 3,100 units per period. This gives a mu_hat of 15,500 (3,100 * 5). I am maintaining a sigma_hat that reflects the high volatility seen during this expansion phase to prevent stockouts, as the system has recently struggled to maintain on-hand inventory due to the rapid growth outpacing historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P25-P27 average demand is 2,713 units, a 14% increase over the P22-P24 average of 2,371 units. The trend suggests mean demand will exceed 3,100 units/period immediately.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory. The average demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) is 2,726 units, compared to the previous three-period average (P23-P25) of 2,499 units (+9% increase). Given the recurring stockouts and the trend where actual demand consistently exceeds previously calculated averages by the time orders arrive, I am shifting to explicit parameters. I forecast the mean demand for the upcoming lead time (L=4) plus current period to be approximately 3,100 units per period, resulting in a mu_hat of 15,500 (3,100 * 5). The lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P23 order arrived P27, P24 order arrived P28). I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels to ensure a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and persistent: P26-P28 average demand is 2,726 units, a 9% increase over the P23-P25 average. Current trajectory suggests mean demand will exceed 3,100 units/period within the next lead time window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10649.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. The average demand over the last three periods (P27-P29) is approximately 2,782 units. Given the persistent growth and the current date (Period 30), I am forecasting a mean demand of 3,100 units per period for the upcoming lead time plus review window (L+1 = 5 periods). This forward-looking approach is necessary because the standard statistical methods (like mean of all samples) are lagging significantly behind the actual trend, leading to constant stockouts. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 15,500 (3,100 * 5) and sigma_hat to 1,500 (approx. 10% of mu_hat) ensures the OR backend targets a base stock high enough to account for the sustained growth and variability during the delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and persistent: P27-P29 average demand is 2,782 units, an 11% increase over the P23-P25 average. Forecast suggests mean demand will exceed 3,100 units/period within the next window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10075.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trend. Recent history (P28-P30) shows demand levels around 2,643 to 2,873 units. Looking back at the growth pattern, demand has increased by approximately 10-15% every three periods. Applying this trajectory, I anticipate mean demand for the next lead time window (L=4) to exceed 3,100 units per period. The on-hand inventory has finally begun to build up (1,417), but stay-out risks remain high given the growth rate and the 4-period lead time. I am using 'explicit' parameters to force a base stock level that accounts for the persistent, non-stationary growth and ensures the OR engine places sufficiently large orders to cover the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand growth continues: Average demand for P28-P30 is 2,777 units, representing a 6% increase over the previous three-period average (P25-P27). Forecast for the upcoming window is ~3,100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10548.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P29-P31) is 2,911 units, while the average for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 2,853. Since Period 30, on-hand inventory has finally begun to accumulate (ending P31 with 1,636), but given the lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent a future stockout as the growth continues. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime, which reflects the current high-demand state (~2,850 units). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a high service level for this high-margin product (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline of 11,828 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P29-P31 average demand is 2,911 units, representing a 7% increase over the P26-P28 average of 2,726. The inventory system has successfully transitioned from chronic stockouts to building a buffer, but aggressive growth persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10353.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, though the growth rate appears to be stabilizing. The average demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 2,975 units, compared to 2,782 in the previous window. While we have successfully built an on-hand inventory buffer (1,667 units), the high demand trajectory persists. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is high (80%), requiring us to maintain sufficient pipeline inventory to cover the (L+1) window. Given the growth, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 15,000 to cover 5 periods (L+1) at an average forecasted demand of 3,000 units/period (3,000 * 5 = 15,000), which incorporates a slight forward-looking buffer against continued acceleration. Sigma_hat is set to 800 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand growth maintains a plateau/slow-growth phase at ~3,000 units/period. Average demand P30-P32 is 2,975 units, a 7% increase over P27-P29 (2,782).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has now transitioned into a plateau/slow-growth phase around 3,000-3,300 units per period. In Period 33, demand reached a new high of 3,391. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P31-P33) is 3,147 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure that the pipeline inventory covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a mean demand (mu) of roughly 3,100 - 3,200 leads to a mu_hat (1+L)*mu of approximately 16,000. Current on-hand is 1,381 and in-transit is 10,352 (Total 11,733), suggesting we are still slightly under-protected against the upcoming 5-period window if growth continues. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand reached a new peak of 3,391 in P33. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is 3,147, representing a 6% increase over the P28-P30 average of 2,975. The growth trend remains active but is decelerating compared to the mid-game exponential phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12392.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a significant growth phase, though the rate of acceleration is showing signs of stabilizing at a higher level. The most recent demand figures (P31-P34: 3046, 3005, 3391, 3368) show an average of 3202 units per period. The 3-period average for the most recent periods (P32-P34) is 3255, reflecting an approximate 8% increase over the previous three-period average (P29-P31: 3010). Since the OR backend uses promised lead time (L=4) and historical stats, and we are in a rapid growth regime, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 captures the most relevant high-demand regime while excluding the much lower early-game data. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand (1080) plus pipeline (10681) is being managed to prevent the chronic stockouts seen in the mid-game. I will use 'recent_N' for N=5 to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current >3,000 unit/period reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: P32-P34 average demand is 3,255 units, an 8% increase over the P29-P31 average of 3,010 units. The mean demand has stabilized above 3,200 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12710.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a strong growth trend, though it has stabilized somewhat around a new mean. The average demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is 3,218 units, compared to 2,876 for P26-P30, representing a 12% increase. The single most recent demand (P35) was 3,282. Given the persistent upward trajectory observed throughout the game, I am applying a forward-looking 'explicit' mu_hat to account for likely demand growth during the next lead-time window (L+1 = 5 periods). I estimate the mean will reach 3,450 units per period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (418), and while in-transit is high (11,578), the aggressive growth necessitates high base stock parameters to avoid reverting to the stockouts seen in earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: P31-P35 average demand is 3,218 units, a 12% increase over the P26-P30 average of 2,876 units. Mean demand is now consistently exceeding 3,200 units per period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 36 reaching 3,448 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 3,366 units, while the 5-period average (P32-P36) is 3,299 units. This represents a significant increase from the mid-game levels. Despite building an inventory buffer in previous periods, the relatively low arrival in Period 36 (1,076 units from the P32 order) caused a complete stockout (ending inventory 0). To ensure coverage over the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods), and accounting for the ongoing growth trajectory, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 17,500 (representing a forecast of 3,500 units/period * 5 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 800 to account for recent volatility and prevent further stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains sustained: P34-P36 average demand is 3,366 units, a 4% increase over the P31-P33 average of 3,235 units. The system experienced a stockout in Period 36 due to a low scheduled arrival (P32 order), confirming that current pipeline must account for higher mean demand (~3,500).

Daily Reward (R_t): $14356.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory, reaching a new high of 3,748 in Period 37. The last three periods (P35-P37) average 3,493 units, which is a 13% increase over the P31-P33 average of 3,147. Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and the pipeline inventory is being exhausted immediately upon arrival, leading to stockouts. Specifically, even with an arrival of 3,589 in P37, we stocked out because demand hit 3,748. To prevent further stockouts and account for the 4-period lead time effectively, mu_hat must be set using a forward-looking explicit value. Based on the current trend (+~5-10% every few periods), I expect demand to exceed 3,800-4,000 units per period within the next lead-time window. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*4000 = 20,000 to ensure the backend projects enough stock for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of this high-growth regime, and Lead Time (L) is calculated as the stable 4-period observation remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: P35-P37 average demand is 3,493 units, a 13% increase over the P31-P33 average. A new peak demand of 3,748 units was recorded in Period 37, leading to a stockout despite a large arrival.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate aggressively, reaching a new peak of 3,929 units in Period 38. The 3-period average (P36-P38) is 3,708 units, which is approximately a 14% increase over the P33-P35 average of 3,247. This growth has consistently outpaced the OR engine's replenishment logic, leading to stockouts in P36, P37, and P38. With a 4-period lead time, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the clear upward trajectory, setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) would yield a mean of 3,708.33 per period (18,541.6 cooled over 5 periods). However, since the trend is still climbing, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting a slight forward-looking adjustment to approximately 3,850 per period to prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. L remains default as the lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and accelerated: P36-P38 average demand is 3,708 units, a 14% increase over the P33-P35 average. Stockouts occurred in three consecutive periods (P36-P38), indicating a need for higher explicit safety buffers to account for the current demand velocity.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, with Period 39 recording a new high of 4,212 units. The last three periods (P37-P39) show an average demand of 3,963 units, which is a 18% increase over the P33-P35 average (3,347). We have faced four consecutive periods of stockouts (P36-P39) despite significant arrivals, signifying that our inventory position is consistently trailing the actual growth curve. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding ratio (4:1), it is optimal to over-estimate demand slightly to ensure product availability. Following the current growth trajectory, I forecast mean demand for the next lead-time window (L+1=5 periods) will reach ~4,400 units per period. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the OR engine to account for this 4,400 forecast and high current volatility (std ~250 during growth), ensuring the pipeline inventory target is raised sufficiently to end the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive and persistent: P37-P39 average demand reached 3,963 units, a 18% increase over the P33-P35 average. Mean demand is currently exceeding 4,200 units per period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand reached 4,461, confirming a persistent upward trend. The average demand for the last three periods (P38-P40) is 4,201 units, representing a significant increase over the previous 3-period average of 3,708 (+13%). Since Period 36, the system has experienced chronic stockouts because actual demand represents the 'real' mean, while arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) were calibrated for a lower demand regime. To stabilize, I am setting an explicit mu_hat based on an expected mean of 4,600 units per period for the L+1 window (5 periods * 4,600 = 23,000). This forward-looking adjustment compensates for the velocity of demand growth. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility associated with this growth phase. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and persistent: P38-P40 average demand reached 4,201 units, a 13% increase over the P35-P37 average. Explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to stay ahead of the trend and mitigate chronic stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15692.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect an aggressive upward trend. In Period 41, demand was 4,166 units, making the 3-period average (P39-P41) 4,280 units. The 5-period average (P37-P41) is now 4,203. Despite large arrivals, the system is consistently stocking out because demand is outrunning the base stock calculations based on historical data. To account for the lead time of 4 periods and the current velocity, the OR backend needs a forward-looking mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover a projected average demand of 4,800 units per period across the review and lead time window (1+L = 5 periods), totaling 24,000. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 1,200 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high volatility observed during this expansion phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: P39-P41 average demand is 4,280 units, a 15% increase over the P35-P37 average of 3,711. Current trajectory suggests mean demand will exceed 4,800 units/period within the next window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15906.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to demonstrate a clear upward trend, though it showed a minor deceleration in Periods 41 (4,166) and 42 (4,040) following a peak in Period 40 (4,461). Despite this slight dip, the 3-period average (P40-P42) is 4,222, which is significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of 3,963. The item has been frequently stocking out (Periods 36-41), and the current on-hand inventory is only 254 units. To stay ahead of the growth trajectory and ensure we fully capture the demand during the 4-period lead time window (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat to 23,250 (calculated as 5 periods * 4,650 units/period). This represents a forward-looking mean that accounts for the historical ~10% growth seen in 3-period windows. Setting sigma_hat to 1,200 provides a safety buffer for the high variance observed during this growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme and sustained: P40-P42 average demand is 4,222 units, a 6.5% increase over the P37-P39 average of 3,963. While individual periods 41-42 showed a slight softening from the P40 peak, the overall trajectory remains aggressively upward.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we analyze the current state of demand and supply for 'chips(Regular)'. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by consistent historical arrivals. Demand has entered a high-volume, albeit slightly more volatile, phase. The most recent three periods (P41-P43) saw demands of 4166, 4040, and 3950, which are lower than the peak of 4461 in P40 but still represent a massive increase from earlier regimes. Specifically, the average of the last 10 periods (P34-P43) is approximately 3889 units. Given the persistent under-ordering that led to chronic stockouts between periods 36 and 41, the OR engine needs parameters that reflect this new high-demand plateau while accounting for volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (post-Period 34) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the increased variance observed during this growth phase. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) window of ~19,445 units, aligning with current pipeline levels and ensuring a sufficient service level for this high-profit-margin item.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime averaging ~3,900 units/period (P34-P43), significantly higher than the mid-game growth phase. Volatility has also increased proportionally with volume.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand was 4,444 units, and the average demand over the last three periods (P42-P44) is approximately 4,145 units. The overall trend, while still high, shows stabilization compared to the earlier exponential growth phase. The 'Carry-over insights' note a high-volume regime averaging ~3,900-4,200 units. Since we are entering the final periods of the game (Period 45 of 50) and lead time is 4, orders placed now will arrive in Period 49. To maximize reward and avoid excess ending inventory in Period 50, I will set mu_hat to cover a stable forecast of ~4,200 units per period across the (L+1) window. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-volume stabilization while filtering out the single peak of Period 40. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current high-volume volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth has transitioned from exponential to a high-volume stable/slow-growth regime averaging ~4,150 units over P42-P44.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15618.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a high-volume demand regime that has stabilized between 3,900 and 4,400 units per period. The recent 3-period average (P43-P45) is 4,253 units, while the 5-period average (P41-P45) is 4,193 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46 to P50), and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. Orders placed after today (P47 onwards) will not arrive before the simulation ends. Therefore, my goal for Period 46 is to ensure the pipeline inventory covers all remaining demand until Period 50. Currently, On-hand is 1,838 and In-transit is 14,259, total 16,097. Estimated demand for 4 remaining periods (decision to arrival window) + review period is (1+4) * 4,250 = 21,250. To capture the current high-demand stability without over-reacting to the P40 peak (4,461), I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and volatility to reflect the current high-volume state.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime (approx. 4,200 units/period) for the final phase of the game (P41-P45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $15129.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime, averaging approximately 4,269 units over the last five periods (P42-P46: 4040, 3950, 4444, 4364, 4530). The exponential growth seen in earlier stages has slowed into a steadier high-volume phase with increased volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the main objective shifts to satisfying remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 2,991, and there is a significant pipeline of 13,114 units. Orders placed in P43 (3,981), P45 (4,595), and P46 (4,538) will arrive in P47, P49, and P50 respectively (assuming L=4). Note: The P44 order was 0, meaning there will be no arrival in P48. To cover demand for the remaining 4 periods (estimated at ~17,200 total units) and account for the missing P48 arrival, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the stable regime) to ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock level that accounts for the current mean demand of ~4,300. This will ensure the final arrivals are sufficient to meet demand without excessive overstocking at the game's conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16003.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period_48, with the game ending at Period_50, we are within the final lead time window. The demand has stabilized in a high-volume regime, with recent demands for P45-P47 being 4364, 4530, and 4595, averaging 4496 units. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 2377 units, and the pipeline inventory of 13820 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50). Given the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's conclusion. Therefore, the primary objective shifts to minimizing holding costs by not adding unnecessary units to the pipeline, while ensuring the existing 'In-transit' and 'On-hand' stock can fulfill the remaining demand. I will set mu_hat to a slightly higher 'explicit' value of 22500 (representing 5 periods * 4500 units) to ensure the base stock calculation doesn't trigger a massive corrective order, though the cap and existing pipeline should naturally result in a zero or minimal order for this final stretch.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with only two decision phases remaining (P49 and P50). The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Due to the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53, which is well beyond the game's horizon. Similarly, an order in Period 50 would arrive in Period 54. Therefore, any orders placed in these final two periods will incur procurement costs without any possibility of contributing to sales or revenue. Our objective is to maximize total reward R_t (Profit \xd7 Units Sold \u2212 Holding Cost \xd7 Ending Inventory). Currently, 'In-transit' stands at 18,721 units, which includes orders from P45 (4,595), P46 (4,538), P47 (4,687), and P48 (4,901). The arrival of the P44 order (which was 0) explains the lack of arrivals in Period 48. The P45 order will arrive during Period 49 and the P46 order during Period 50. Each of these upcoming arrivals (~4,500 units) is sufficient to cover the current demand regime (~4,300-4,700 units). Placing additional orders now would be wasteful. I will set the parameters to essentially stop ordering by setting a very low mu_hat relative to the massive pipeline inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are at the final decision point. The demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime, with the most recent demand (P49) at 5,087 units and a 5-period average (P45-P49) of approximately 4,670 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' pipeline is very high (18,814 units), reflecting aggressive orders from previous periods (P46, P47, P48, P49). Specifically, the orders from P46 (4,538), P47 (4,687), P48 (4,901), and P49 (4,688) are all in transit and expected to arrive over the next four periods. Since this is the final period, the goal is to set parameters that reflect the current high-demand state (~4,700 mean) while allowing the OR engine's capped base-stock policy to determine if any final small adjustment is needed to the existing large pipeline. Using recent_N=5 for demand captures the most current high-volume level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~4,700 units/period (P45-P49 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
