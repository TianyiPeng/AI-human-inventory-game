In Period 44, a stockout occurred when demand (4,444) exceeded available stock (4,200), but Period 45 demand subsided slightly to 4,364. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Currently, there are 136 units on-hand. Since this is the late game (Period 46 of 50) and demand has shown significant variance and occasional spikes back toward 4,500, I will target a stock level of 4,500 to provide a buffer against potential period-over-period growth or high variance spikes, while minimizing excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation.

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned from a long-term hyper-growth phase into a high-level fluctuation regime. Over the last five periods (P42-P46), demand has averaged approximately 4,266 units, with the most recent demand hitting 4,530 units. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 47. Given the recent peak of 4,530 and the high profit margin ($4) vs. holding cost ($1), the cost of a stockout is significantly higher than the cost of holding inventory. I will target an order of 4,700 units to provide a safety buffer against the upward variance seen in the last two periods (4,364 to 4,530) and the recent stockout in Period 46.",

To ensure high service levels and capture the upper bound of recent variance (approx. 4,600-4,700), and considering the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), I will order enough to cover an expected demand of 4,650 units.

The Period 48 demand (4776) resulted in a stockout as starting on-hand inventory (4650) was insufficient. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To maximize profit in Period 49, I must cover the expected demand which is trending toward the 4800-4900 range.
