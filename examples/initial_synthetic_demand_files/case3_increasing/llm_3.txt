  "rationale": "Step 1: World Knowledge & Product Analysis - 'chips(Regular)' is a stable consumer packaged good (CPG) with relatively consistent demand, though susceptible to social events or weekends. Step 2: Demand Analysis - Based on the provided historical samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand is approximately 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of ~17. Step 3: Lead Time & Pipeline - The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the risk of stockout during the order cycle (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to target inventory to cover the next 3 periods of demand. Step 4: Inventory Assessment - Current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0. Step 5: Order Logic - Target stock level = Average Demand * (Lead Time + 1) + Safety Stock. Calculation: 111.4 * 3 = 334.2. Adding a small safety stock buffer due to the initial 0 inventory: 335 + ~40 units (approx 2.3 standard deviations for high service level) = 375. Order for Period 1 = 375 units.",
