According to the GAME MECHANISM, an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5 (1+4) and be visible/usable at the start of Period 6. Therefore, I must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods). My current on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. Expected total demand for the first 5 periods is approximately 111.4 * 5 = 557 units. Given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), target service level should be reasonably high.
