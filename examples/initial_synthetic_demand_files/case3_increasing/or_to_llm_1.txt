There are no units in-transit. \n\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation of 3,340 units is severely undershooting current demand. This is because the OR agent uses all historical samples (starting from ~100 units) and does not adjust for the massive regime shifts that have occurred. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts, an order reflecting the recent average (~4,280) plus a small safety margin is required.\n\n5. **Final Strategy**: I will order 4,500 units.
