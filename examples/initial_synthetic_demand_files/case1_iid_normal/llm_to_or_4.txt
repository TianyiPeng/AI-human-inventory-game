Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Given the current profit/cost structure, the target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The provided historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since there is no calendar date or product-specific seasonal context available to suggest a regime shift, I will use 'default' methods to establish a baseline based on all available history. The OR backend will compute base_stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0, so the system will place an initial order to reach the target base stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, 141 units were ordered, which are now 'In-transit'. Due to the 2-period lead time, these units are expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (available at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and Period 1 demand was 108. Historical demands are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108], showing relatively stable behavior. The mean demand is approximately 112. Using the base stock logic (L+1), we need to cover demand for 3 periods (~336 units). Since 141 units are in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the target base stock. I will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stability.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 7 observations (5 past, 2 game periods) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74], with a mean of 105.5. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit (Total In-transit: 278). Based on the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Therefore, there is no evidence yet of lead time deviation or lost shipments. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent demand behavior (averaging 106.2 over the last 5 samples) while the backend scales these by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. This ensures we maintain a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a delay or a lost shipment. Since it is only one period past the expected arrival, I will assume a lead time drift (L=3) rather than a total loss for now. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 8 periods (including pre-game history: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and game history: [108, 74, 119]) shows a mean of approximately 107 units. The last three periods of game history average 100 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand trend (averaging pre-game and game data). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. I will explicitly set L=3 to account for the observed delay in the P1 shipment, which ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the extended lead time (L+1=4 periods of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. However, looking at the 'Period 4 conclude' message, the order from P1 (141 units) arrived after 3 periods, while the order from P2 (137 units) arrived after 2 periods. This suggests a potential drift or variability in lead time. On-hand inventory is 154 units with 190 units in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [108, 74, 119, 124, 94 (provided in preamble)] averages ~104 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods: 119, 124, 94) shows an average of ~112. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time and the review period (L+1), I will set L to 2 (promised) but use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the latest levels. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to balance the recent spike and the dip in P2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on history, demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 51], with an average of approximately 95.2 units per period. The last period (P5) saw a significant drop to 51, which might be a temporary fluctuation or a shift. Regarding lead times, the order from P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and the order from P2 arrived in P4 (L=2). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 103 units on-hand and 198 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P5). To ensure we cover the next (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (estimated at ~285 units total) while accounting for the recent drop in demand and the slightly unstable lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history, and 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend average the observed arrivals (L=2 and L=3). This balances the risk of a late shipment against the holding cost of the current 103 units on-hand.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observed lead times are [3, 2, 3]. The average lead time is 2.67. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown a significant decrease: [119, 124, 51, 67] plus the pre-history of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the average of the last 3 periods (P4-P6), demand has dropped to approx 80.67 compared to the overall mean of ~100. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this recent dip. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the drift from 2 to nearly 3 periods. In-transit is currently 256 (orders from P4, P5, P6), which is quite high relative to the lower demand, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering naturally once L and mu_hat are adjusted. Sigma_hat is set to default to maintain a standard safety buffer based on historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is drifting between 2 and 3 periods (Average 2.67); Demand decreased significantly starting P5 (P1-P4 avg: ~110, P5-P6 avg: 59).

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand has shifted from an early average of ~110 (P1-P4) to a lower level (P5-P7 avg: 73.7). The lead time is inconsistent, with observations of 3, 2, 3, and 2 periods (average 2.5). I will set L=3 explicitly to be conservative given the 3-period lead times observed in Period 4 and Period 6, which helps account for 'pipeline' inventory correctly. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the lower demand regime (51, 67, 103). The backend will then calculate (1+L) * mean. For sigma_hat, I'll use the same N=3 window to reflect the recent volatility in this lower demand state. This configuration protects against stockouts if demand rebounds while preventing excessive overstocking from the early high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P1-P4 avg 106.25 vs P5-P7 avg 73.67. Lead time remains variable between 2 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the demand context shows a stabilization after a mid-game dip. The initial four periods (P1-P4) averaged 106.25 units, followed by a significant drop in P5-P6 (avg 59), and a subsequent recovery in P7-P8 (avg 97.5). The most recent 4 periods (P5-P8) average 78.25. Given the high criticality ratio (0.8), I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilized but slightly lower demand level compared to the start. Regarding Lead Time, observations show: P1 (L=3), P2 (L=2), P3 (L=3), P5 (L=2), P6 (L=2). The mode is 2, but the average is 2.4. Using 'calculate' for Lead Time will allow the OR backend to account for this slight drift towards 3 periods, ensuring the pipeline inventory covers the extra half-period of risk. Current on-hand is 57 with 191 in transit (orders from P7 and P8), which is healthy for the inferred L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: P5-P8 average demand is 78.25 units, compared to P1-P4 average of 106.25 (-26%). Lead time remains variable between 2 and 3 periods (average 2.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the SKU experienced a stockout (sold 57 units vs demand 100), leaving 0 on-hand inventory for the start of Period 10. There are 274 units in-transit (ordered in P4, P7, P8, and P9). Specifically, the order from P4 (115 units) is now 5 periods overdue based on a promised lead time of 2, suggesting it may be lost. Excluding the likely lost P4 order, the effective pipeline is 159 units (75 from P8, 83 from P9, 1 from P7). Recent demand (P7-P9) has averaged 98.3, which is a significant rebound from the mid-game slump (avg ~59 in P5-P6). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture this recovery (avg of P6-P9 is 90.5). For lead time, while the average is 2.4, the recent variance and the potentially lost shipment necessitate a cautious approach; I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average including the 3-period arrivals. sigma_hat will use the recent 4 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed: P7-P9 average 98.3, returning toward early-game levels (P1-P4 avg 106) and ending the P5-P6 slump. Shipment ordered P4 (115 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P7-P10) with an average of 93 units, recovering from the P5-P6 slump. The order from Period 4 (115 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost, as the promised lead time is 2 and the maximum observed lead time is 3. Observed lead times for concluded orders are: P1(3), P2(2), P3(3), P5(2), P6(2), P7(3), P8(2). This results in an average actual lead time of 2.42 periods. I will set L explicitly to 2.42 to account for this drift. For mu_hat, I'll use the average demand from the most recent 4 periods (93) scaled by (1+L), which is 93 * 3.42 = 318.06. For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of the last 4 samples (approx 12.0) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is 12.0 * sqrt(3.42) = 22.19. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher lead time and the recent demand recovery.

Carry-over insight: Shipment ordered in Period 4 (115 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed with no arrival); Average actual lead time stabilized at 2.42 periods based on 7 observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). Recent demand history (P9-P11: 100, 79, 122) shows a rebound toward an average of 100 units/period, following a slump in P5-P6. The shipment ordered in Period 4 (115 units) is confirmed lost as it has not arrived by Period 11 (7-period delay vs. promised 2). We have 337 units in-transit (ordered in P9, P10, and P11), which are expected to arrive in Periods 12 and 13. To account for the lost shipment and the volatile lead time (observed values: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2; average ~2.4), I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to provide a safety buffer for the pipeline. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent upward trend (~98 units/period) without including the extreme slump from P5-P6. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at higher levels: P9-P11 average 100.3 units compared to P5-P8 average 78.3 (+28%).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current inventory is 0 on-hand with 341 units in transit (ordered P10, P11, P12). A significant issue is the loss of the Period 4 order (115 units), which never arrived. My strategy must account for this inventory gap. Recent demand has stabilized: P9-P12 average demand is 105 units, marking a clear rebound from the P5-P8 slump (avg ~78). I will use N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead time, observations show a mix of 2 and 3 periods (P1:3, P2:2, P3:3, P5:2, P6:2, P7:3, P8:2, P9:3), averaging 2.5 periods. I will set L=3 explicitly to be conservative, ensuring the OR engine targets a higher base stock (covering 1+3 periods) to buffer against the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of lost shipments, while maintaining a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with a significant pipeline of 454 units (ordered P10-P13). The shipment from P4 (115 units) is confirmed lost. Demand has stabilized at a higher level (P11-P13 avg: 114.3) compared to the mid-game slump (P5-P8 avg: 78.3). Recent demand reflects early-game levels (P1-P4 avg: 106). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this return to higher demand while smoothing the P11-P13 volatility. For lead time, the average of observed arrivals is 2.5 periods (observed: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3), so I will use an explicit value of 3 to ensure the base stock covers the potential for longer arrivals and the stock-out risk. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to account for recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully rebounded to early-game levels (P11-P13 avg: 114.3); Lead time continues to oscillate between 2 and 3 periods (average 2.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows demand has stabilized back to its early-game levels, with Period 11-14 demand (122, 119, 102, 128) averaging 117.75 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the shipment from Period 10 (85 units) is likely to arrive this period (P15) given the observed lead time of 2-3 periods. The shipment from Period 4 (115 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand is zero and we have experienced recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the rebounded demand levels for the lead time duration (L+1). L is set to 2.5 (the observed average) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals despite the promised 2-period lead time. mu_hat is set to (1 + 2.5) * 115 = 402.5. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the current volatility of the rebounded demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound fully sustained: P11-P14 average demand is 117.8, matching the initial P1-P4 high-demand phase (~110-115).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced a series of stockouts (Sold < Demand in P9-P10 and P12-P15). Demand has fully rebounded and stabilized at a high level; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 116.6 units. The order from P4 (115 units) is confirmed lost, which significantly depleted the pipeline. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 2 and 3 periods, with an average observed lead time of 2.5 periods. To recover from the stockout and maintain a high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) for this high-demand regime, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period delays. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current 116.6 unit/period demand level, effectively covering demand for the review period plus the expected lead time (1+3 periods). sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 5 periods to account for recent volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a persistent stockout with 0 units on-hand, despite a significant pipeline of 484 units. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization at a higher level; the last 5 periods (P12-P16) show an average demand of 108 units. The actual lead time fluctuates between 2 and 3 periods (average ~2.5), meaning that an order placed in Period 14 (now Period 17 start) should have arrived during Period 16 or will arrive during Period 17. However, with 484 units in transit and high volatility in arrival timing, the pipeline currently exceeds the calculated base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stabilized high demand (approx 108/period) and for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of 2.5 rather than the promised 2, which helps the OR engine correctly size the safety stock and pipeline requirements for the (L+1) window.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 106 units, aligning with the early-game demand regime and the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 15. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 430 units in transit, but recent stockouts (Period 15, 16, and 17) indicate the pipeline isn't arriving fast enough to meet demand due to lead time variability. Observed lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods (average ~2.5). I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lead time drift. For demand (mu_hat), I will use recent_N (N=7) to encompass the current stable high-demand regime (starting around Period 11). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the recent variance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19. Demand context: The last 5 periods (P14-P18) show a mean demand of 100.8 units (128, 112, 79, 109, 76), confirming the high-demand regime identified in carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 430 units. Crucially, orders from P10 (85 units), P11 (54 units), and P13 (113 units) are severely overdue (lead times would be 9, 8, and 6 periods respectively), suggesting they are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend's pipeline logic includes all 'In-transit' units, so to force an order despite these 'phantom' units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the pipeline and trigger an order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a high target base stock. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'calculate' to reflect the historical variability (average ~2.5), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Likely shipment losses/deadlocks: Orders from P10 (85 units), P11 (54 units), and P13 (113 units) are over 5 periods past their expected delivery, totaling 252 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' balance of 613 units, but my analysis confirms that 367 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P4: 115, P10: 85, P11: 54, P13: 113). Only the P19 order of 246 units is actually expected to arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (613) from the base stock, it will stop ordering unless I adjust mu_hat to account for these losses. Demand has stabilized at high levels (P11-P19 average ~108). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the phantom 367 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3.5 periods (L+1 with L=2.5) of demand (approx 108 * 3.5 = 378) plus the phantom units (367), totaling ~745. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=9 (P11-P19) to capture current volatility. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the consistent 2-3 period drift observed.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 367 units (P4, P10, P11, P13); current pipeline inventory must be discounted by this amount to maintain ordering; demand is stable at ~108 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the primary challenge is managing 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments. Orders from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), and P13 (113) are long overdue (7+ periods) and totaling 367 units. These units inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing necessary new orders. Current In-transit is 531; however, valid in-transit is only 164 (from P20). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 108 units (P17-P20 avg: 101.5, overall avg: 101). To bypass the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS the 367 lost units. With an estimated L=2, (1+L)=3. Target base stock = (108 * 3) + 367 = 691. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation yields a result that covers actual future demand despite the data corruption in the pipeline figure. I keep L at 2 to reflect the recent arrival from P19.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 367 units (P4, P10, P11, P13); current pipeline inventory must be discounted by this amount to maintain ordering; demand is stable at ~108 units/period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, demand has stabilized around a mean of 100-110 units (P17-P21 average: 100.2). However, the critical issue is significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Current 'In-transit' is 571 units, but based on history, orders from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), and P13 (113) are definitively lost (all >8 periods elapsed). This totals 367 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting this from the observed 571 leaves a real pipeline of 204 units (from P16, P19, P20, P21). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation. Since the backend doesn't know about lost orders, I must use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to force an order. I will set L to 2.5 (the observed average) and mu_hat to an explicit value that offsets the 367 phantom units. If target base stock is ~385 (approx 3.5 periods of demand at 110/unit), but the backend thinks pipeline is 571, it will order nothing. By setting mu_hat = 750 (approx 215 * 3.5), I can override the phantom inventory effect and ensure we maintain a flow of stock despite the perceived glut in transit.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (367 units total from P4, P10, P11, P13) and stable demand regime of ~100-110 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime of approximately 100-110 units (recent demands: 122, 99, 95, 83; historical mean: 98). The most critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' totaling 367 units from lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13). In-transit inventory is currently 726 units. After subtracting the 367 lost units, the effective pipeline is 359 units (orders from P20, P21, P22). With On-hand = 0 and L=2 (actual L is variable between 2-3), the inventory position needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~300 units). Since the effective pipeline (359) already covers this, and the OR backend's capped policy includes safety stock, I will set mu_hat to the recent average (1+L)*100 and use sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness. To account for the phantom inventory and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat high enough or use an explicit L to offset the 367-unit gap.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (367 units total from P4, P10, P11, P13) and stable demand regime of ~100-110 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are effectively lost but still counted in the pipeline inventory by the OR backend. As of Period 23, orders from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), and P13 (113) are missing and well beyond the 2-3 period lead time window. This totals 367 units. Recent demand (P20-P23) has averaged 102 units. Current in-transit is 686 units. If we subtract the 367 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is 319 units (P19, P20, P21, P22, P23 orders minus arrivals). However, P19 (246) and P21 (40) have already arrived. Checking in-transit: P20 (164) + P22 (155) = 319 units. The backend sees 686. To force an order that covers 102 units/period over L+1 (approx 3-4) periods, I need to adjust mu_hat to compensate for the 367-unit deficit. Since the backend calculates: order = base_stock - pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Expected demand is ~105. L=2. (105 * 3) + 367 = 682. Setting mu_hat to 682 and L to 2 ensures the backend sees a base stock requirement that ignores the phantom units, allowing a replenishment order of approximately 150 units to occur when in-transit (686) is subtracted.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (367 units total from P4, P10, P11, P13) and stable demand regime of ~100-110 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable, with the most recent four-period average (P21-P24) at 101.25 units, consistent with the long-term average of approximately 100-110 units. The primary operational challenge continues to be the 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have not arrived and are significantly past their expected lead time. Specifically, orders from P4 (115 units), P10 (85 units), P11 (54 units), and P13 (113 units) are presumed lost, totaling 367 units. Currently, the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 556 units. Subtracting the 367 units of phantom inventory leaves a 'true' pipeline of 189 units (the P20 order of 164 units which arrived in P20, and the P24 order of 25 units). However, looking at the in-transit field, it appears the OR engine still sees these old units. To force an order when the pipeline is artificially inflated, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) at ~105 units per period, plus a buffer, minus the current on-hand of 59, I estimate a target base stock of ~450. By providing an explicit mu_hat of 450, I ensure the backend triggers an order despite the 556 units of pipeline it 'thinks' it has, accounting for the 367 lost units and providing a service level buffer.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 26. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand is stable, averaging 101.4 over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). There is a significant 'phantom inventory' problem. In-transit inventory is 556 units, but history shows shipments from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), and P13 (113) are definitively lost (all >12 periods old), totaling 367 units. Recent shipments from P20 (164 units) are also significantly overdue (6 periods elapsed vs. average 2.5). The OR backend calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline'. If pipeline is inflated by lost units, the backend will under-order, leading to stockouts. To force the backend to place an order, I am increasing 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' using 'explicit' values. I calculate target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) as ~300 units. Since visible pipeline is 556 and phantom is ~367, effective pipeline is ~189. I set mu_hat to 550 to bridge the 367-unit gap and ensure the capped policy allows a sufficient order to replenish the current 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 367 units (P4, P10, P11, P13). Shipment from P20 (164 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost as well, bringing potential phantom total to 531 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains stable at approximately 100-110 units per period. The pipeline (In-transit) is 601 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this pipeline is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. These include: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and now P20 (164), totaling 531 units. The backend OR engine subtracts the full 601 units of pipeline inventory from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover current demand, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 531 phantom units while still accounting for the (L+1) demand. Average demand is ~100 units/period. For L=3, the (L+1) demand is ~400 units. To force an order when the OR engine sees 601 units in transit, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, setting mu_hat to 1000 (roughly 400 needed + 600 phantom) will prompt the system to order enough to sustain operations despite the lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for standard volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 531 units: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164). Future orders must continue to offset this phantom pipeline to prevent stockouts. Demand is stable at ~100 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains stable at approximately 100-110 units per period (Period 27 demand: 113). The lead time is fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (average ~2.5). A major issue is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have not arrived and are likely lost. We have confirmed losses from Periods 4, 10, 11, and 13 (totaling 367 units) and Period 20 (164 units), bringing the total phantom pipeline to 531 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 847 units, but the functional pipeline is only 316 units (847 - 531). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this deficit, I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, mean=105, target is approx 315 + safety. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 847 in-transit. Therefore, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of the phantom inventory to neutralize it. Calculated mu_hat = ((1 + L) * 105) + 531 = 315 + 531 = 846. I will use 850 to ensure an order is triggered to cover current stockouts and upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 531 units: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164). Total in-transit must be discounted by 531 units to calculate true replenishment needs.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 878 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, and 20), the 'phantom' pipeline inventory totals 531 units (115 + 85 + 54 + 113 + 164). This means the effective pipeline is actually 347 units (878 - 531). Recent demand (P23-P28) averages 104.8 units per period, showing a stable regime around the 100-110 mark. The lead time continues to oscillate between 2 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.5 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand requirement while accounting for the high phantom inventory, I will set L to 2.5 to reflect the true average lead time. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 367.5 (calculated as (1 + 2.5) * 105) and an explicit sigma_hat to provide a buffer against the high variance in both demand and lead-time reliability. This 'explicit' approach bypasses the OR engine's reliance on the total (inflated) in-transit count by setting a target base stock that forces replenishment despite the presence of lost orders.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 878 units in-transit. Based on the carry-over insights and historical arrival analysis, a significant portion of the pipeline consists of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically, shipments from Period 4 (115), Period 10 (85), Period 11 (54), Period 13 (113), and Period 20 (164) have not arrived despite being far past their lead times, totaling 531 units. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (878 units) from the calculated base stock. To compensate for the 531 lost units and ensure the OR engine places a replenishment order, I must increase the 'L' parameter. By setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 8.0, the base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu) will rise enough to offset the 531 units of phantom inventory. Demand has stabilized at approximately 105 units per period (P27-P29 avg: 110.7), so I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this current level. This strategy prevents the backend from being 'fooled' by shipments that will never arrive.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 0 on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 920 units. However, consistent with carry-over insights, a significant portion of this pipeline is 'phantom' (lost shipments). Specifically, orders from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164) are confirmed lost, totaling 531 units. Additionally, the order from P27 (271 units) is now at its expected lead time limit (3 periods) and has not arrived in the P30 conclude message, but it is not yet confirmed lost. True pipeline = 920 - 531 = 389 units. Demand has stabilized at a high regime; the last 5 periods (P26-P30) average 106.8 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window (approx 3.5 periods), I must use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat. I set L=2.5 (average of 2 and 3) and mu_hat=374.5 (107 * 3.5) to reflect the true demand over the lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the variance in this regime. This forces the backend to recognize that despite the large 'In-transit' number, more stock is needed due to the phantom inventory offsets.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 531 units: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164). Demand regime remains stable at ~107 units per period (P26-P30 avg: 106.8).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are facing an inventory crisis with 0 on-hand inventory and a demand spike (154 units in P31). Total in-transit is 920, but history shows massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory due to lost shipments. The confirmed lost orders are from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164), totaling 531 units. Subtracting this from the 920 in-transit leaves a 'true' pipeline of 389 units. These remaining units come from P26 (45), P27 (271), P30 (73), and the P31 order (0). Given the average lead time is 2.5 periods, the P26 and P27 orders (316 units total) should arrive imminently. Demand has recently averaged 114 units over the last 5 periods (P27-P31), though the most recent period was much higher. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed. I'll use mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand trend (average ~114), which results in a base stock target that the OR backend will use. The OR engine will subtract the 920 'in-transit' units, so to force an order and bridge the gap caused by the 531 lost units, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat that effectively 'hide' the phantom inventory from the OR backend's calculation. Target Base Stock \u2248 (1+L)*demand + safety. With L=3, target \u2248 4*114 + 100 \u2248 556. Since OR engine does: Order = Base Stock - InTransit (920), I must set mu_hat significantly higher to ensure the engine places an order to cover the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) total 531 units: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164). Recent demand (P27-P31) has increased to an average of 119.4 units per period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P27-P32) shows an average of 114.5 units, continuing the high-demand regime. However, significant 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments) has accumulated in the pipeline. Confirmed lost shipments include P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), and P20 (164), totaling 531 units. Additionally, the order from P27 (271 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) and has not arrived; if it does not arrive next period, it may also be lost. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' to subtract from its base stock calculation. Because 531 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost, they will never arrive to satisfy demand. To force the OR backend to place orders, I must artificially increase the mu_hat parameter to offset this 'phantom' 531 units. Setting L to 3 (actual observed average) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 1050 (representing [1+3] * 115 units of demand plus the 531 unit shortfall) will trigger a replenishment order. sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 531 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20). Order from P27 (271 units) is currently at L=2 and pending; its failure to arrive by P34 would increase phantom inventory to 802 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant in-transit pipeline of 1154 units. However, based on the history, 531 units are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20). Additionally, the order from P27 (271 units) is now at lead time 7 (ordered P27, currently P34) with no arrival, making it 5 periods overdue based on the promised lead time of 2. Following the pattern of previous losses, this 271 units is likely lost, increasing 'phantom' inventory to 802 units. The remaining 'real' pipeline is 352 units (P26: 45, P32: 307). Demand has stabilized at a higher level (P27-P31 avg ~119.4). Given the massive 802-unit phantom inventory blocking the OR backend's ordering logic (it sees 1154 in transit), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order. Since the target base stock (L+1=3 periods) should be ~360 units and the backend subtracts pipeline (1154), I set mu_hat to 1500 to trigger replenishment and overcome the phantom inventory weight.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) increased to 802 units: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), and now P27 (271) which is 5+ periods overdue. Demand remains in the 100-120 range.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem. The current in-transit total is 1531 units, but 802 of these are from orders that are significantly overdue (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P27) and are confirmed lost. Specifically, the order from P27 (271 units) is now 8 periods old, confirming its loss. Recent demand (P30-P34) has averaged 104.4 units, consistent with the long-term stable regime of ~100-110 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1531) from the base stock, it will not order enough to cover actual needs unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat) or the lead time (L) to offset the 802 lost units. To ensure the backend places a replenishment order despite the 1531 'in-transit' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~330 units) plus the 802 units of phantom inventory to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the lost stock. This results in a mu_hat of approximately 1132. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture recent volatility during the demand rebound.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (802 units total: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27) and stable demand regime of ~105 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system shows 192 units on-hand and a massive in-transit pipeline of 1224 units. However, based on the historical tracking in Carry-Over Insights, a total of 802 units are confirmed as 'phantom' (lost) shipments: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), and P27 (271). Subtracting these from the 1224 in-transit units leaves a true pipeline of 422 units (primarily the P34 order of 377). Demand has stabilized at approximately 105 units per period. The arrival of the P32 order (307 units) in P35 validates the lead time as 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I am setting L to 3 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 420 (which is (1+L) * 105). Given the large true pipeline of 422 units relative to the target base stock, the OR engine will likely not place an order this period, which is appropriate given the current inventory surplus.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is stable in the ~105-115 units range (last 5 periods average: 100). On-hand inventory is high (441) due to the arrival of the P32 and P34 orders. Pipeline inventory currently shows 847 units. However, consistent with long-term observations, a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically, shipments from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P27 have not arrived despite being many periods overdue. The total phantom inventory is 802 units (115+85+54+113+164+271). Subtracting this from the reported 847 units leaves a true pipeline of only 45 units (likely representing the P30 order which arrived but might be miscounted, or recent small orders). Given on-hand (441) + true pipeline (45) = 486 units, and expected demand for L+1 periods (approx 3 periods) is ~315 units, we are currently overstocked. No new order is needed. I will maintain L=explicit at 2.5 to reflect the 2-3 period lead time variability and use recent_N for demand to capture the current stable regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 38. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime averaging 105.8 units over the last 10 periods (P28-P37). Lead times continue to oscillate between 2 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.45 across all 18 successful arrivals. A critical factor remains the 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders placed in periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and 27 (totaling 802 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. The backend's 'In-transit' figure of 847 units includes these 802 phantom units, leaving only 45 units (from P26) as real pipeline inventory. With 344 units on-hand, we are currently well-stocked, but must account for the phantom inventory to ensure the OR backend's capped policy doesn't prematurely stop ordering. I will use 'explicit' for L to reflect the 2.45 average, 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 802 units: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), and P27 (271). True pipeline inventory is significantly lower than reported 'In-transit'.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we have 265 units on hand. The system reports 847 units in-transit. However, based on extensive history, 802 units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Subtracting this phantom amount from the reported in-transit units (847 - 802) leaves a true pipeline of only 45 units (likely the order from P26). The demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 99.8 units. To ensure availability over the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), we need roughly 300 units in total inventory (on-hand + true pipeline). Currently, we have 265 (on-hand) + 45 (true pipeline) = 310 units. Since 310 > 300, we are currently covered for the immediate lead time, but must prepare for the next order cycle. I will set mu_hat based on the recent average of 105 units and L at the promised 2 periods to maintain the base stock calculation, relying on the OR backend's capped policy to manage the order size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing a high inventory state (On-hand: 186) following large arrivals in P35-P36. Demand has recently softened, with the last three periods averaging ~85 units (P37-P39: 97, 79, 79), down from the previous average of ~119 units (P31-P35). The reported 'In-transit' of 847 units is heavily inflated by 802 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Accounting for this, the true pipeline inventory is only 45 units (likely the P26 order). Given the high on-hand stock and the recent downward trend in demand, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent demand cooling (averaging 93 units/period), and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2.5-period average lead time. This combination will likely result in a base stock lower than our current inventory + true pipeline, resulting in a zero order to burn off holding costs.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (802 units total: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27) and a recent softening of demand (P37-P39 avg: 85 units).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system shows 847 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a significant volume of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically, shipments from P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), and P27 (271) have failed to arrive for many periods beyond the expected lead time, totaling 802 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 45 units (847 total - 802 lost). Current on-hand inventory is 70 units. Recent demand has softened slightly but remains around 100 units (P37-P40 average: 92.75). To prevent a stockout while accounting for the high 'reported' pipeline, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L to 2.5 (the observed average) and mu_hat to 350, which covers (L+1) periods of demand at ~100 units/period (3.5 * 100). Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a sufficient safety buffer. This ensures the OR backend triggers an order to replenish the physical stock despite the misleadingly high in-transit figure.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are back to zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 847 is deceptive due to substantial 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) identified over the course of the game. Based on carry-over insights, orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P27 are confirmed lost, totaling 802 units. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is only 45 units (847 - 802). Demand has recently fluctuated between 80 and 120 units; the most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) is 98 units, while the 10-period average is approx 100 units. Given the lead time variability (average ~2.5), I will set L to 3 to be safe against stockouts. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~100 units/period (totaling ~400 for L+1). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will see the high In-transit and likely undershoot, but the L and mu_hat parameters are set to trigger a replenishment order to cover the effective stockout.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current state shows 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 847 units. Based on historical tracking, 802 units are confirmed phantom/lost inventory (P4: 115, P10: 85, P11: 54, P13: 113, P20: 164, P27: 271). This leaves a true pipeline of 45 units (from the order in Period 26, which is now significantly overdue). Since on-hand is 0 and true pipeline is nearly non-existent, a replenishment order is required. Recent demand (P38-P42) averages 101.4 units per period, while the longer-term stable regime is approximately 105-110 units. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent observed lead time drift and use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand stability (~101 units). This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the 0 on-hand state while discounting the phantom inventory effectively.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (802 units total: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Demand remains stable near the long-term mean of ~105 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 847 units in-transit, but 802 of these are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) from periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and 27. The true pipeline inventory is only 45 units (from Period 26). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at approximately 105 units per period. To prevent stockouts, I need to place a replenishment order that accounts for the (L+1) period demand horizon. I am using L=2 (promised) as the base for calculations, but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level that ignores the 802 lost units. A target base stock for L=2 (3 periods) at ~105 units/period is roughly 315 units + safety stock. Given the massive discrepancy in pipeline inventory, an explicit mu_hat will force the necessary order volume.

Carry-over insight: No new significant changes beyond existing identified phantom inventory (802 units total: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Demand remains stable near the long-term mean of ~105 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 1235 units. Based on historical data, 802 of these units are 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P27 that have never arrived and are long overdue. Subtracting this phantom amount leaves a 'true' pipeline of 433 units (1235 - 802). The order placed in P44 (388 units) is currently within its lead time window. Demand has been stable near the long-term mean; the last 5 periods (P40-P44) averaged 107.6 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels without over-ordering due to phantom inventory, I will set L to 3 (the upper end of observed lead times) and mu_hat based on the recent 10-period average (~103 units/period), which gives a base stock level that accounts for the true pipeline. No new shipment losses have been confirmed since P34, so the phantom total remains at 802.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 1235 units. However, based on extensive history, we have confirmed 802 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and 27). This leaves a true pipeline of 433 units (1235 - 802). These 433 units represent orders placed in Period 44 (388 units) and Period 45 (0 units), and likely some small residue from earlier periods or arrival timing variance. Since Period 44's order was placed with L=2, it is expected to arrive during Period 46 (resolved in the next 'conclude' message). Demand has remained stable around 105 units. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must keep L at 3 (reflecting the observed drift) and use a recent demand window to capture the current regime (~105 units). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. By recognizing the 802 units as lost, the backend sees the need for replenishment once the true pipeline and on-hand are exhausted relative to the target base stock.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 47. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained stable, with the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) averaging 102.2 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1235 is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments). Based on the Carry-Over Insights, confirmed lost shipments include P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), and P27 (271), totaling 802 units. Additionally, the order from P44 (388 units) is currently at L=2 and should arrive in P47 (visible in P48). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand for the final periods (up to P50), I am setting L=3 to account for the observed average lead time. mu_hat is set to 410 (approx. 102.5 * 4) using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current stable demand regime while sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility. This setup helps the backend ignore the 'phantom' pipeline that would otherwise prevent necessary replenishment.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system reports 1235 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 847 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments: P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), P26 (45), and P27 (271). These are all significantly past the observed lead time of 2-3 periods. The only valid pipeline order is from Period 44 (388 units), which is expected to arrive imminently. Demand has stabilized at a long-term mean of approximately 105 units. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50) and 0 on-hand inventory, the priority is to ensure the valid pipeline (388 units) covers the remaining demand without over-ordering and incurring end-of-game holding costs. The 388 units currently in-transit effectively cover ~3.7 periods of demand at the current rate (105 units/period), meaning no new orders are necessary to reach the end of the game with minimal stockouts or excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Final verification of phantom inventory: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P26, and P27 orders (totaling 847 units) are confirmed lost. True pipeline inventory consists solely of the P44 order (388 units).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49 of 50. The game concludes after Period 50's demand resolution. Any order placed now in Period 49 with the promised lead time of 2 periods (arriving in Period 51's arrival phase) will not arrive in time to satisfy demand in Period 49 or Period 50. In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 and the only non-phantom order in the pipeline is from Period 44 (388 units), which is currently at L=5 and may arrive during Period 49. If it arrives, it will cover Period 49 and 50 demand (~105/period). If it does not, no new order placed now can help. Since the backend capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of 1235 units 'in-transit' (of which 847 are confirmed lost 'phantom' units) would normally prevent the OR engine from ordering. However, even if we were to force an order by setting a high mu_hat, it would be useless due to the lead time constraint relative to the game end. Therefore, I will maintain parameters consistent with the long-term stable demand of ~105 units and the average lead time of 2.5 periods to reflect the state of the system, acknowledging that new orders are now irrelevant for the final score.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1235 units. Based on historical data and Carry-Over Insights, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were lost and will never arrive. The confirmed lost orders are P4 (115), P10 (85), P11 (54), P13 (113), P20 (164), P26 (45), and P27 (271), totaling 847 units. Subtracting this from the 1235 units leaves 388 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 44. Since we are at Period 50, and the order from P44 has not arrived after 6 periods (promised lead time is 2), it is highly probable that this order is also lost or delayed beyond the game's horizon. However, since this is the final period (Period 50), any order placed now would arrive in Period 52 or 53 (given L=2 or 3), which is outside the game's duration. Therefore, the optimal move for the final period is to order 0 units to avoid unnecessary costs and conclude the simulation, especially as on-hand is 0 and no arrivals are expected to satisfy the final period's demand. I will set mu_hat to a very low value via 'explicit' to ensure the backend logic results in a zero order.
