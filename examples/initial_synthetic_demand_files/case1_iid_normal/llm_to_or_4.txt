Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 recent periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.2. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no previous arrivals to confirm actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the 'default' method, which calculates demand based on the full historical sample of 5 periods. This ensures the initial order covers the expected demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5 periods), helping to reach the base stock level while accounting for current volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in a stockout for Period 1 since we started with 0 inventory. The current demand was 108. Looking at the historical demand (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) plus the recent Period 1 demand of 108, the demand is relatively stable around a mean of ~112. Since no actual lead time has been concluded yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical data (including the internal history of 5 samples + Period 1) to calculate the base stock. The OR backend will see (L+1) = 5 periods of demand for the base stock calculation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 0 for 'chips(Regular)'. In the first two periods, we had demand of 108 and 74 units but could not fulfill any sales because no inventory has arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (137 units) are in-transit (total 278). The first shipment is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. Historical demand from the setup (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) plus recent game history (108, 74) suggests an average demand of approximately 105 units. Since there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviations (as it's only Period 3 and L=4), I will use the promised lead time and demand averages. I'll use method 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=7 (all 5 historical + 2 game samples) for demand to capture recent observations.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message read at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 417 units (141+137+139). Past demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119] show relative stability. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) to capture the most recent fluctuations while the lead time remains at the default promised value of 4, as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 564 units in-transit). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Since this hasn't happened yet (we only see 'Period 4 conclude'), we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units despite demand. Demand over the first 4 periods was 108, 74, 119, and 124 (mean ~106). Including the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall mean is 110.2. Using L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the default methods as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation or a significant demand regime shift beyond normal variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand over the first 5 periods has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 51], averaging 95.2. Period 5 saw a noticeable dip (51 units), but there's not enough evidence yet to call it a sustained regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 90 and in-transit is 440 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters use the default lead time (4) and the mean/standard deviation of all available demand samples to stabilize the order flow, as the pipeline is quite full (440 units) compared to the average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 160 units on-hand and 338 units in-transit. Historically, demand has averaged 98.4 units over the last 11 samples (pre-game: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94; in-game: 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67). However, the last two periods show a significant drop in demand (51 and 67). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Given the inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 498) and the recent lower demand, we are well-covered for the (L+1) horizon. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for demand to capture the recent downward trend while still accounting for the earlier volatility, ensuring we don't over-order into a potential demand slump while maintaining a buffer for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed in P5 and P6 concludes). Demand shows a potential downward shift in P5-P6 (avg ~59) compared to P1-P4 (avg ~106).

Daily Profit: $412.00, Daily Holding Cost: $196.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we start with 196 units on-hand and 211 units in-transit. Historical data (P5-P7 concludes) confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows two distinct blocks: P1-P4 averaged 106.25 units, while P5-P7 averaged 73.67 units. The most recent demand (P7) was 103, suggesting the 'downward shift' mentioned in previous carry-over insights might be stabilizing or reverting. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7, all available samples) for mu_hat to capture the overall average demand of ~92.2 per period while acknowledging the recent volatility. This yields a total mu_hat over (1+L) = 5 periods of approximately 461 units. Given the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 407), the OR engine will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the target base stock, balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit potential.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed: Range [51, 124], mean ~92. No sustained regime shift confirmed yet as P7 demand (103) returned toward the initial mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the concludes of P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand has been volatile: the last four periods show demand of [51, 67, 103, 92], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 78.25. This is lower than the initial four-period mean of ~106. Since demand fluctuates significantly without a clear sustained trend (ranging from 51 to 124 overall), I will use a larger sample size (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to smooth out the noise while acknowledging the recent lower values. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory is healthy with 251 on-hand and 172 in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8 totaling 172). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to adapt to the lower average demand seen since P5 without overreacting to the P5-P6 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5 through P9). Demand remains somewhat volatile but stable in terms of its mean. The historical demands are: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100] (in-game). The combined mean of all 14 samples is approximately 99.6. While Periods 5 and 6 showed a dip, subsequent periods (7-9) have seen demand return to the ~100 range. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 243, comprising orders from P6 (35), P7 (12), P8 (108), and P9 (88). Given the promised lead time of 4, we expect the P6 order (35) to arrive during Period 10. I will use the 'default' lead time method since 4 matches the promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default) as the demand appears to have reverted to its long-term average after a brief two-period deviation.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1 through 6 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand history across 10 periods (108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79) shows a mean of 91.7 and a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. There is no clear sustained regime shift, although demand fluctuates between a low of 51 and a high of 124. Current on-hand inventory is 124, with 340 units in transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the promised lead time (L=4) is consistent with observations, I will use the 'default' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent history and smooth out the high volatility observed in the middle periods (P5-P6), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $474.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that 'chips(Regular)' has a confirmed lead time of 4 periods based on the arrival history from P5 to P11. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (14 units) following a demand of 122 in P11. However, the in-transit pipeline is substantial (367 units). According to the lead time of 4, the order placed in P8 (108 units) is expected to arrive during P12 and will be visible in the next period's conclude message. The demand history across 11 periods [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122] shows no sustained regime shift, oscillating around a mean of approximately 94.4. Given the volatility (std dev ~22.6), I will use the last 11 samples (all available history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=11 ensures the backend captures the full variance of the known demand distribution while maintaining the service level needed for a product with a 4.0 profit and 1.0 holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. Analysis of historical arrivals (Periods 5 through 12) consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4, matching the promised lead time. Demand history for the last 12 periods [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119] shows stability around a mean of ~96.5. While there were lower-demand periods (P5-P6), the more recent 6 periods (P7-P12) show a mean of ~102.5, suggesting the earlier dip was not a sustained regime shift. Because the system calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, and the lead time is 4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the most relevant demand trend. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for current volatility. On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the in-transit pipeline (394 units) contains orders from Periods 9-12 scheduled to arrive in Periods 13-16, which should sufficiently cover pending demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending 0), resulting in 11 units of lost sales (demand 102 vs 91 sold). The Promised Lead Time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as seen in the arrivals for orders placed in P1 through P9. The current demand pattern shows fluctuations but remains centered around a mean of approx 97. The in-transit pipeline (436 units) includes orders from P10 (132), P11 (39), P12 (135), and P13 (130). Order from P10 (132 units) is expected to arrive in Period 14 resolution phase. I will maintain the lead time at 4 (default). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=13 to capture the full observed history of this SKU's demand since the start of the game, acknowledging the relative stability of the 90-110 range after an initial volitile period. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods across all concluded orders (P5-P14). Demand has stabilized after some early volatility, with recent samples (P11-P14) being [122, 119, 102, 128], yielding a mean of approximately 117.8 and a relatively low standard deviation compared to the full history. The inventory level is currently very low (on-hand: 4), though a large pipeline (397 units) is in transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand level (approx 115-120 per period) compared to the long-term average (approx 102). This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1)=5 periods, reflects current consumption trends while the lead time remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (avg ~118) over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) compared to the initial 10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 501 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all historical arrivals. Demand analysis: the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) show demand levels of 122, 119, 102, 128, and 112, averaging approximately 116.6. This confirms the regime shift noted in the 'Carry-over insights' from Period 15. The system experienced stockouts in P13 (demand 102, sold 91) and P15 (demand 112, sold 43) due to low starting inventories, despite arrivals matching promised lead times. To optimize for the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the recent high-demand environment (~117 units/period). This will assist the OR backend in maintaining a higher base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the significant in-transit pipeline of 501 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17. The promised lead time is 4. Historically, arrivals have consistently confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods (P5 through P16 conclude messages). Inventory is currently tight with only 56 units on-hand and some historical stockouts (P13 and P15). Demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) shows values of 122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79. While P16 saw a dip (79), the local mean from P11-P15 was approximately 116.6. Including P16, the 6-period mean is ~110.3, while the full history mean is ~102. Recent demand (P11-P16) suggests a stable higher regime. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand while accounting for recent volatility. This provides a balance between the high demand seen in P11-P15 and the dip in P16 to avoid over-ordering given the $1/unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~110 over the last 6 periods (P11-P16); P16 shows significant volatility (79) compared to previous 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the on-hand inventory is 77, and there are 400 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5-P17). Total demand over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) has been [122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109], showing a mean of approximately 110.1 and a standard deviation of 16.5. This represents a sustained higher demand regime compared to the first 10 periods. The pipeline inventory (400) plus on-hand (77) total 477, which is roughly 4.3 periods of demand cover. Given L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher-demand regime and its associated volatility. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 110.1 = 550.5 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+4) * 16.5 = 36.9. These parameters will ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock levels sufficient to cover the lead time plus current demand while accounting for recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe a steady lead time of 4 periods across the recent history. Demand analysis: The most recent demand samples are 128, 112, 79, 109, and 76 (Periods 14-18). While earlier periods suggested a regime of ~118, the last three periods (79, 109, 76) show significant volatility with a slight downward trend in the mean compared to the P11-P14 peak. The mean of the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is 106.75, which is closer to the long-term average than the temporary peak identified in Period 15. The 'In-transit' quantity of 412 includes orders from P15 (143), P16 (101), P17 (63), and P18 (105). The P15 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 19 resolution phase (visible in P20). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for a relatively high service level. I will use recent_N with N=8 for demand parameters to capture the stabilization after the P11-P14 spike while maintaining sensitivity to recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 107 over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), correcting the previous upward spike observation from Period 15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current observation shows a stabilized demand environment. The most recent 'Period 19 conclude' message confirms that the order from Period 15 arrived after exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time and historical consistency since Period 5. Demand has fluctuated between 76 and 128 in the last 10 periods (P10-P19), with an average of approximately 104.9. The previous carry-over insight from Period 19 noted a stable average around 107 over recent periods. Given the context (Regular chips, no specific calendar date drivers like holidays mentioned), demand is behaving like a stationary process with moderate volatility. On-hand inventory is 115 and in-transit is 329, which covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain the service level calculated by the OR backend (Critical Ratio \u2248 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering P11-P19) to capture the current stable regime without being skewed by the slightly higher initial volatility or early period starts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P11-P20) with a mean of approximately 106.8. This is slightly lower than the all-period mean, suggesting a subtle shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which is confirmed by all recent conclude messages. The on-hand inventory is 117, and the pipeline inventory is 358 (sum of orders from P17-P20), giving a total inventory position of 475. Given a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need items to cover demand for Period 21 through Period 25 (L+1 = 5 periods). With a mean of ~107 per period, 5 periods require approx 535 units. The current position (475) is below this requirement. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the noisy initial periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 107 over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), confirming a consistent pattern with moderate volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on historical arrival messages (Period 5 through Period 21 consistently show lead_time=4). Demand over the most recent 11 periods (P11-P21) has an average of approximately 105.7 units per period. The recent demand samples are [122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109, 76, 122, 99, 95]. The demand remains relatively consistent with the established regime noted in past carry-over insights. Therefore, I am using a recent_N approach with N=11 (the length of the stable regime) to capture current mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend uses the most representative data to set the base stock level (covering L+1 = 5 periods of demand) and the safety stock, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrival data. The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 12 periods (P11-P22). This latest segment (avg ~104, std ~18) is more representative of current behavior than the full history, which includes early periods with higher variability and lower sales efficiency due to stockouts. The inventory position is currently 479 (107 on-hand + 372 in-transit), which covers roughly 4.6 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=12) ensures the base stock reflects the current stable regime, while the default sigma_hat accounts for recent volatility to maintain a high service level without overstocking, as profit is significantly higher than holding cost ($4 vs $1).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a stable regime. Over the most recent 13 periods (P11-P23), the average demand is approximately 106.9, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~107. While P23 showed a spike (131), the overall pattern doesn't suggest a structural shift. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P19's order arrived exactly in P23). Current on-hand is low (36), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (386). My strategy is to maintain the base stock level using the stable demand regime from P11 onwards (N=13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide enough safety stock for the lead time + 1 period coverage while the OR backend manages the pipeline. I will set L to 4 using the calculate method as it matches the confirmed actual lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P11-P24) shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 105 units and consistent volatility, despite a few spikes (e.g., P23 demand of 131). The Carry-Over Insights and confirmed lead times of 4 periods suggest the environment is stable. Currently, on-hand inventory is 70 and in-transit is 393, totaling 463 units. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a mean of 105, the expected demand over this window is 525 units. The current pipeline (463) is slightly below this requirement. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the stable regime desde Period 11) to capture this demand pattern effectively. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable around an average of 105 from Period 11 to Period 24 with no new significant shifts detected.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with no significant shifts detected in recent periods. The most recent demand (Period 25 conclude) was 89, and the average since Period 11 hover consistently around 104-105 units. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern observed in the history. There are no overdue shipments; all orders from Period 1 through Period 21 have arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering. The current pipeline inventory (398 units) plus on-hand inventory (74 units) is 472 units, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a window of the last 15 periods (since the last major regime shift stabilization) to calculate demand mean and volatility, which provides a representative sample of the current stable regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods (P11-P26), with an average demand of approximately 104 units. The original promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every order that has arrived so far. Currently, on-hand inventory is 72 and in-transit is 392 (totaling 464). Given the observed lead time (L=4), the inventory needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. At the recent average of 104, this equates to 520 units. My current pipeline is slightly below this, which justifies placing an order. I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 11.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101.5 over the last 15 periods (P13-P27), with periodic fluctuations between 76 and 131. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory state: On-hand is 33, and In-transit is 404. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 437. Given L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At a mean of ~102, the target is roughly 510 units. Since 437 is below this, the OR engine will generate a replenishment order. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable recent demand regime while filtering out the early experimental phase. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4-period lead time is consistent with historical observations.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean around 104-105 units over the long term. Looking at the last 10 periods (P19-P28), the average demand is 102.8, which is very close to the overall average. There have been no significant shifts in demand regime or lead time. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the concluding messages (e.g., P28 conclude shows the P24 order arrived, confirming L=4). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, which provides a stable base for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. This approach balances the need to maintain sufficient inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to cover (L+1) periods of demand while managing holding costs.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101.5 units over the last 10 periods (P20-P29) and 102.5 over the last 15 periods (P15-P29). The Promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every conclusion message since Period 5, with no missed or delayed shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 49 units and the pipeline (in-transit) is 385 units. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target critical ratio is 0.8, which supports a high service level. Since the demand regime has been stable for a significant duration, I will use a recent window of N=15 to capture the stable mean and variance while filtering out the earlier, more volatile startup phases. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the existing pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistently stable around a mean of 105 units. Over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 102.8, which aligns with previous' Period 25' carry-over insights. Volatility is moderate with no discernible seasonal or calendar-driven spikes. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. On-hand inventory is currently low (21 units), but the pipeline inventory (403 units) is robust. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 will capture the stable long-term mean and variance of this regime while filtering out noise. The backend OR will calculate a base stock levels that sustain a high service level given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a significant upward shift, ending the long-standing stable regime of ~105. Period 31 demand reached 154, following a slight upward trend in previous periods (113, 109, 110, 111). On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite 86 units arriving in Period 31, indicating that demand is outpacing recent stock levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp increase in Period 31 demand (approx. 45% above the previous average), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this shift while maintaining some smoothing from the preceding periods. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend places larger orders to recover from the stockout and meet the higher demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Period 31 demand (154) is significantly higher than the previous 20-period average (~105), suggesting a new high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $346.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 31 (154) was a significant spike compared to the long-term stable average of ~105. Period 32 demand (90) represents a return closer to the mean, but the spike in P31 necessitates a more reactive forecasting approach in case of a new high-demand regime or increased volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on history. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent variance while still anchoring to the most recent behavior. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility observed in the P31 spike. Current on-hand is low (14), so the OR backend should maintain a healthy pipeline to ensure service levels.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a spike at Period 31 (154), but following periods (32 and 33) have seen a return to lower levels (90 and 87). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is approximately 107, which is very close to the established long-term average. The 'spike' at P31 appears to be an outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to all recent 'conclude' messages. I am using a recent_N of 10 for both demand and sigma to capture the current volatility while remaining grounded in the stable 105-110 mean observed since Period 11. This helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against the recent high volatility (std dev has increased due to the 154 demand point) without over-ordering for a trend that hasn't fully materialized.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a spike at Period 31 (154), followed by a return to lower levels (90, 87, 80). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 100.4. While Period 31 was an outlier, the subsequent periods suggest the demand regime has not sustained that high level, but rather returned to the previous stable mean around 100-105. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 60 units on hand and 423 units in transit, the pipeline is relatively full relative to the lead time (L=4). Using recent_N for both mu and sigma will allow the backend to adjust to the recent volatility while reflecting the most current demand mean since the shift observed in Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 (154) was transient; demand returned to ~85 over Periods 32-34. Current 10-period mean (P25-P34) is 100.4.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand spike in Period 31 (154) appears transient as demand in Periods 32-35 returned to a more moderate level (avg 92.5). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) is 104, which aligns with long-term stability around 105. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 76 and 367 units in transit (covering orders from periods 32-35), the pipeline is sufficient but needs careful management to avoid holding costs while maintaining service levels for the ~105 demand level. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while grounding the mean in the most recent consistent regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with recent mean fluctuations. After a spike in Period 31 (154), the subsequent periods (P32-P36) have shown demands of 90, 87, 80, 115, and 128. The last 5 periods average approximately 100, which aligns with the longer-term stabilized average previously observed. I will use a recent_N of 10 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this moderate volatility while smoothing out the transient spike. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31 and P32 orders arrived exactly on time in P35 and P36 concludes). I'll continue using 'calculate' for lead time to use historical data. The sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P32-P37) has shown a moderate increase compared to the previous stable regime, with a 6-period average of approximately 116 units (90, 87, 80, 115, 128, 97 after the P31 outlier). While Period 31 was an outlier (154), the subsequent periods suggest a stabilization at a slightly higher level than the long-term average of 105. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 112, with a strong pipeline of 378 units. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this recent behavior (P31-P37) specifically, which balances the high outlier and the subsequent stabilization to ensure sufficient stock for potential demand swings while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~116 over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), moving slightly higher than the previous 105 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we analyze demand history to set OR parameters. Recent demand (P32-P38) shows an average of ~111, which appears to be a slight upward shift from the long-term stable average of ~105, despite a lower demand of 79 in P38. The spike in P31 (154) was transient, but the subsequent period average remains elevated. Lead time is consistently 4 periods per historical concludes (P5 through P38). I will set L to 'default' (4). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering P32-P38) to capture this recent higher-demand regime while smoothing the volatility. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the current demand variability. The backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~111 over the last 7 periods (P32-P38), slightly higher than the previous 105 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $256.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown recent fluctuations. After a brief spike in Period 31 (154), demand stabilized around a mean of 111 (Periods 32-38), but the most recent measurements (Periods 38 and 39) have dropped to 79. This suggests the previous upward 'stabilization' noted in Carry-over Insights may be fading or reverting to a lower mean. To balance the risk of being overstocked (given the $1 holding cost vs $4 profit) while maintaining service levels, I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window includes the recent lower demands (79, 79) and the moderate peak demand periods (115, 128), providing a balanced forecast of approximately 100 units/period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, which is the promised value; hence I will use 'default' for L. The backend OR will compute the base stock using this mean/std and lead time (L=4) to cover effectively 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Latest observations (P38-P39) show demand softening to 79, pulling the 10-period average down toward 100, counteracting the previous insight of stabilization at 111.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate fluctuations. Over the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the average demand is 101.8. However, looking at the very recent trend post-spike (P32-P40), the mean is 96.8. Given the carry-over insight that demand recently softened and then bounced back to 116 in P40, there is no clear sustained shift to a new regime, but rather a return to the long-term stable average of around 100-105. I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this recent volatility while anchoring to the current trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes. Pipeline inventory is healthy (370 units), which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand. The backend will use these stats to maintain a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, targeting a service level of approximately 80% (4/(4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $379.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some fluctuations recently. While Period 31 saw a spike (154), subsequent periods (P32-P41) have averaged approximately 101 units (100.9). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P38-P41) had demands of 79, 79, 116, and 119, with an average of 98.25. Given the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (P32-P41) to capture the current stable mean of ~101, which is more representative than the longer-term history. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods will account for the recent volatility seen in the data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 101 over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), following a transient spike in P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable following a brief spike in Period 31. Over the last 11 periods (P32-P42), the average demand is 100.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.0. Although recent periods P40-P42 showed a slight increase (116, 119, 114), they remain within the expected range for the current regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 80 units on hand and 337 units in-transit (ordered P39-P42), the pipeline inventory is healthy. I will use a 10-period lookback window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand behavior while smoothing out the transient spike from Period 31. This balances the service level against holding costs by reflecting current volatility (\u03c3~18) and mean (~101).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 101 units over the last 12 periods (P32-P43), with the spike in P31 confirmed as a transient outlier. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) due to a small arrival in Period 43 (ordered in P39 when demand was predicted to be much lower/inventory higher). I will use recent_N (N=12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the post-spike stabilization period. This corresponds to (1 + L) * mean of 101.4 and sqrt(1 + L) * standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Given the low on-hand stock and moderate pipeline, this data-driven approach will prompt the OR engine to replenish based on the stable but slightly volatile history.

While there was a significant transient spike at Period 31 (154), subsequent demand has settled around the long-term average. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the order from Period 40 in Period 44. I will set L to 'default' (4) and Use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the transient spike) to capture the current stable regime and ensure the base stock levels remain appropriate for the observed volatility.

The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around an average of 101.5 units over the last 14 periods (P32-P45), following a brief spike in P31. The 10-period mean (P36-P45) is 102.4. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P43-P45). The current on-hand inventory is 35 units, and in-transit inventory is 393 units (from orders in P42, P43, P44, and P45). With the game ends at Period 50, we are in the final phase. To ensure adequate service levels while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability post-spike, and default for lead time (4).

The lead time is consistently 4 periods as verified by the most recent arrival in Period 46 (ordered P42). On-hand inventory is low (20), but pipeline inventory is healthy (406). Given the proximity to the game end (Period 50), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 10-period window to capture this stable post-spike regime. This window size (N=10) provides a balance between responsiveness and smoothing, covering the current stable demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 15 periods (P32-P47), with a specific 5-period average (P43-P47) of 103.8. The transient spike in P31 is well in the past. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory at 24 with 383 units in-transit (covering orders from P44, P45, P46, P47), the current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand. However, since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy and must operate every period, I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stability and set L to default (4). This ensures the order logic maintains an appropriate service level without over-ordering relative to the recent moderate volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the long term, with the most recent 10-period average (P39-P48) sitting at approximately 103.3 units. Period 48 ending on-hand inventory is 0 due to an arrives delay or lower-than-full fulfillment (specifically, P44's order of 69 units arrived exactly, but demand exceeded on-hand). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the latest arrival in P48 from the P44 order. I will set L to 'default' (4 periods) and use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~103) while factoring in the moderate volatility (std dev ~14.5) observed in this window. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus one period of demand (5 periods total) to mitigate the current zero-inventory state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a stable regime. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is approximately 108.3 units, which is consistent with the longer-term stable average of ~105-110 observed since Period 11 (excluding the transient spike in P31). There are no upcoming calendar events or product seasonality indicated by the date 'Period_50'. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with significant stock in transit (446 units). Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, and the order placed today is for the 5th period out, a base-stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) is appropriate. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable mean and variance, avoiding the influence of the P31 outlier and reflecting current system dynamics.
