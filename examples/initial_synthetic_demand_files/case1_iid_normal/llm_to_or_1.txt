Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The historical demand data provided is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], which gives an average demand of approximately 111.4 units per period. Since this is the first period and we have no observed arrivals or concludes yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=2). To set the base stock level, the OR backend uses the formula (1+L) * mean. For Period 1, I'll use the mean of all 5 historical samples (N=5) to establish a baseline demand (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), the service level is roughly the 80th percentile. Starting with default parameters and a recent N=5 window for demand statistics is appropriate to capture the baseline while remaining sensitive to future shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order for 141 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2 periods lead time). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and demand in Period 1 was 108. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the most recent demand of 108, totaling 6 samples. The mean demand is approximately 110.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 15.1. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order parameter mu_hat should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the default method for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat across the available history is appropriate as no clear regime shift or seasonal spike is yet evident. The backend will calculate base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, where the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74] (game history), totaling 7 observations with a mean of 105.57. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (137 units) are currently in-transit (Total 278). Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Thus, the current on-hand inventory of 0 is expected. There is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time has deviated from the promised 2 periods or that demand has shifted significantly (though the last demand of 74 was lower than average). I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N for demand to capture the most relevant recent history (N=5) to set base stock levels. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the game mechanism, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be reported in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which we would see now. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0 for the order of 141 units placed in Period 1. This indicates a delay or a lead time longer than promised. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand for Periods 1-3 (sold=0), we are in a stockout. The in-transit pipeline is 353 units (141 from P1 + 137 from P2 + 75 from P3). I will adjust the lead time parameter L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay. For demand, the last 5 samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the recent game history [108, 74, 119] suggest a relatively stable mean around 107. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while acknowledging the stockout risk.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, we have observed two arrivals in Period 4: the order from Period 1 (lead time = 3) and the order from Period 2 (lead time = 2). This confirms that the actual lead time varies around the promised 2 periods, with one instance of a delay. Total demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game history) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124]. The recent mean demand (last 4 periods since start) is approximately 106 units. Current inventory is 154 (on-hand) + 190 (in-transit: 75 from P3 and 115 from P4). To ensure coverage over the L+1 window (3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=4) to capture the current environment's mean, and 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (2 and 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the inventory and lead time for chips(Regular). Historical demand across the last 5 periods (including past data) shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the recent 5 simulated periods show [108, 74, 119, 124, 51]. The mean demand of all 10 observations is approximately 103.3. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2. Observation from Period 4 shows one order arriving with lead_time=3 (Period 1 order) and another with lead_time=2 (Period 2 order). This suggests that while 2 is the promised time, delays can occur. No orders arrived in Period 5, which is consistent with the Period 3 order (75 units) having a lead time of 2 (it should arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message seen at the start of Period 6). However, the 'In-transit' count is 309 (Period 3: 75, Period 4: 115, Period 5: 119), which confirms the Period 3 order hasn't concluded yet. This indicates a potential lead time drift or delay. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (3 and 2) and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the slightly lower recent volume (avg ~95) while maintaining safety stock. The high 'In-transit' vs 'On-hand' (103) suggests we should be cautious with over-ordering until the pipeline clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7 context: On-hand inventory is 111 with 256 units in-transit. Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67] shows a recent downward trend in the last two periods (mean of 59 vs. historical average of ~100). Lead time analysis: Observed arrivals show lead times of 3, 2, and 3 periods, suggesting an actual lead time longer than the promised 2. For Period 7, I set L=3 (explicit) to account for this drift. I use mu_hat with recent_N=6 (P1-P6) to capture the game's actual demand volatility and recent softening (average ~90.5) while balancing against the pre-game higher mean. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a stable buffer over the extended lead time. This configuration ensures the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers the (L+1) horizon while adjusting for the observed lead time reality.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is drifting: 2 out of 3 observed shipments arrived in 3 periods instead of the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the history shows that the promised lead time (L=2) is inconsistent. Specifically, orders from P1 and P3 arrived in 3 periods, while orders from P2 and P5 arrived in 2 periods. The Carry-over Insight from P7 correctly identified this drift. Given the variability, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average (currently (3+2+3+2)/4 = 2.5). Demand shows recent fluctuations: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103]. The mean of the last 4 periods is approximately 86, which is lower than the initial mean. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower, more recent demand regime while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. Current inventory (On-hand: 127 + In-transit: 177 = 304) is robust, but the parameter settings will ensure we maintain a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period demand exposure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the current on-hand inventory is 57 units with 239 units in transit. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 2 in 2, Period 3 in 3, Period 5 in 2, and Period 6 in 2. This suggests an average lead time fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods, slightly higher than the promised 2. I will use L=2.5 via 'explicit' to reflect this drift. Demand remains relatively stable with the last 5 samples [124, 51, 67, 103, 92], averaging ~87.4 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. The pipeline inventory (239) plus on-hand (57) totals 296, which covers over 3 periods of average demand, providing a buffer against the lead time variability while the OR backend optimizes for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time variability: 40% of observed shipments (2/5) arrived in 3 periods instead of 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows that while the promised lead time (L) is 2, actual lead times vary between 2 and 3 periods (e.g., Period 1 and 3 arrived in 3 periods; Periods 2, 5, and 6 arrived in 2). Specifically, the order from Period 7 (40 units) and Period 8 (84 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-3 period pattern, we expect the Period 7 order to arrive during Period 10 (today) or 11. Demand is relatively stable but fluctuates around 100 units. Given the stockout in Period 9 and the lead time drift, I will use L=3 to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the mean demand since the start of the game (approx 93 units), which is higher than the pre-game samples. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=9 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains inconsistent: 2/5 observed arrivals (40%) took 3 periods instead of 2. Recent demand (last 9 periods) avg 93.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 92 units over the last 10 periods (91.7 average), though the initial 5-period history provided showed a higher mean of 111. Lead time remains the primary concern: out of 8 orders placed and arrived, 3 had a lead time of 3 periods (P1, P3, P7) and 5 had a lead time of 2 periods (P2, P5, P6, P8, promised). This suggests an actual average lead time closer to 2.4 periods. To protect against the 3-period lead time risk and stockouts seen in Period 9, I will set L to 3. For demand, the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean of 88.2, which is more representative of the current regime than the full history. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) with L=3 will target a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (~353 units). This covers the pipeline of 290 units and current on-hand of 45, ensuring a sufficient buffer for the next delivery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability persists: 37.5% (3/8) of shipments arrive in 3 periods; 62.5% (5/8) arrive in 2. Current demand regime (P6-P10) mean is 88.2, down from initial 111.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current inventory status is 0 on-hand with 334 units in-transit. Demand analysis: The most recent demand (Period 11) was 122 units. Over the last 6 periods (P6-P11), the demand mean is approximately 93.8 units, while the initial 5 periods averaged 111.4 units. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture this moderate downward shift in demand while maintaining responsiveness to the high Period 11 demand. Lead time analysis: Historical data shows lead times are inconsistent (observed: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2). There are 3 instances of 3 periods and 4 instances of 2 periods. The average lead time is 2.43. Since the OR backend uses L as an integer or rounded value for the base-stock calculation (1+L), and we have frequent occurrences of 3-period lead times, I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average, which effectively hedges against the 40% probability of 3-period delays. Currently, we are stocked out (on-hand 0), so ensuring the base stock level (mu_hat across 1+L periods) reflects the recent demand and lead time variability is critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Last 6 periods (P6-P11) average 93.8 units vs initial 111.4. Lead time continues to oscillate between 2 and 3 periods (average 2.43).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history indicates a regime shift since Period 6. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P6-P12) is 97.4, which is lower than the initial average but higher than the 88-93 range observed in previous periods. Specifically, the last two periods (P11, P12) saw spikes to 122 and 119 respectively, suggesting volatility. Regarding lead time, we have observed 9 shipments: four took 2 periods (P2, P5, P6, P8) and five took 3 periods (P1, P3, P7, P9, and inferred for P4 which arrived with P1/P2). This results in an average actual lead time of approximately 2.56 periods. Setting L to 3 is the safest approach to account for the frequent 3-period delays and prevent stockouts during the replenishment cycle. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 7 to capture the demand stabilization since Period 6. For sigma_hat, I am also using N=7 to reflect the current variability, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 6 (P6-P12) shows a mean of 97.4 and higher recent volatility (P11-P12 > 115). Lead time is now confirmed to be 3 periods in 55% of cases (5/9 shipments), with an average of 2.56 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, the last three periods (P11, P12, P13) all ended with 0 inventory, and demand was partially or fully lost. The 'In-transit' quantity is high (424 units), but arrivals are erratic. Lead-time analysis shows a significant shift: of the 10 completed shipments, 5 had a lead time of 3 periods and 5 had a lead time of 2 periods. Specifically, orders from P10, P11, and P12 are currently in transit; if lead time is 2, the P11 order (44 units) should have arrived in P13 (it did not). If lead time is 3, P11 (44 units) and P10 (119 units) should arrive in P14 and P13 respectively. Since P13 conclude showed 0 arrivals, the P10 order is now officially late (L > 3) or lost. To protect against this lengthening and unreliable lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to increase the base stock calculation. Demand since P6 has stabilized around a mean of 98.4 (N=8). I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while accounting for the higher volatility seen in recent stockout periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is now confirmed to exceed promised 2 periods frequently: 50% of shipments take 3 periods, and the order from Period 10 is now at L=4 with no arrival yet, indicating potential loss or severe delay.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high inventory fragility with 0 on-hand and high stockout risk. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 99 units over the last 9 periods (P6-P14). More critically, the lead time is highly unreliable: the average observed lead time is 2.5 periods, but the order from Period 10 (119 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. The order from Period 11 (44 units) is also at L=3 without arrival. To protect against these delays and potential losses, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to increase the pipeline target and mu_hat to 400 (representing (1+3) * 100) to ensure the base stock covers a longer lead time horizon. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to provide a higher safety buffer given the recent stockouts and lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 10 (119 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed at L=4; Lead time now effectively 3 periods for safety planning. Demand regime mean is ~99 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 units and 443 units in transit. Looking at the history, the order from Period 10 (119 units) is officially considered lost or extremely delayed (now at L=5), and the shipment from Period 11 (44 units) is also delayed (L=4). Based on the 'Period 14 conclude' and 'Period 15 conclude' messages, shipments from P12 arrived in 2 periods, but P13 (107 units) should have arrived by now (P16 start) if L=2, or will arrive during P16 if L=3. Because actual lead times frequently hit 3 periods (confirmed in 55% of cases previously), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the (L+1) window effectively. The demand regime since Period 6 remains relatively stable with a mean of approximately 99-100 units. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent volatility while accounting for the extended lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 10 (119 units) and Period 11 (44 units) are likely lost or stuck in a severe delay (L >= 5). Current lead time for safety planning is established at 3 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and significant supply chain disruptions. Analysis of history confirms that shipments from Period 10 (119 units, now L=7) and Period 11 (44 units, now L=6) are lost, as the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 443 includes these 163 lost units. To compensate, the OR backend needs to recognize that the effective pipeline is only 280 units (443 - 163). I will set L=3 based on recent history where 3-period arrivals are frequent (P9 and P12 both arrived in 3 periods). For demand, the most recent stable regime (P11-P16) averages 102 units, but volatility is high; I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current mean. This configuration increases the base stock to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1) and accounts for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline by forcing an order through a conservative lead-time estimate and demand recentering.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 10 (119 units) and Period 11 (44 units) are confirmed lost (L>=6). Pipeline inventory is overinflated by 163 units. Effective lead time for planning is 3 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable regime since Period 6, with an average demand of approximately 99 units. The most critical issue is the loss of 163 units in pipeline inventory (119 units from Period 10 and 44 units from Period 11), which are now confirmed lost (L>=6). The current 'In-transit' figure of 414 units is misleadingly high because of these 163 lost units, meaning the true pipeline is only 251 units (Orders from P13=107, P15=58 - already arrived, P17=29, P18=pending). However, since the OR backend uses the reported pipeline (414) to calculate orders, it will under-order significantly. To counteract this, I am setting L to 3 (as confirmed by recent history) and setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that forces the OR engine to order enough to cover the stock-out. Calculated mu_hat for L=3 is (1+3)*99 = 396. To offset the 163 lost units, I adjust the base stock target upward: 396 + 163 = 559. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=12 (P6-P17) to capture the current regime's volatility, where N=12 represents the stable demand period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) despite high demand (avg ~99 units). The pipeline inventory of 585 units is significantly inflated by 163 units from lost shipments (P10: 119 units, P11: 44 units), which have now reached L=9 and L=8 respectively, far exceeding the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock and ensure the OR engine places an order. I am using L=3 for planning based on the carry-over insight that 3 periods is the effective lead time for reliability. The target base stock for (L+1=4) periods should be approximately 4 * 105 (current demand trend) + safety stock. Given the massive stockout and the pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 650 to bridge the 163-unit loss gap and cover upcoming demand, forcing the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory is overinflated by 163 units due to lost shipments from Period 10 and 11; effective planning lead time remains 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable but slightly volatile regime with a recent mean of approximately 101 units (P15-P19). The pipeline inventory of 511 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P10 (119), P11 (44), and P13 (107), totaling 270 units. The order from P17 (29 units) is also overdue, suggesting it may be lost or delayed. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent lead-time drift (previously 2.43-2.56) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat where mu_hat covers (1+L) periods, I set mu_hat to 404 (approx 101 * 4 periods) to ensure sufficient stock despite the lost pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility (76 to 128 range).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory is overinflated by 270 units due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 10, 11, and 13; Period 17 shipment (29 units) is also likely lost at L=3. Effective planning lead time is 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized demand regime. The average demand over the last 15 periods (P6-P20) is approximately 98.7 units, and the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) average 97 units. We have identified a significant issue with lost shipments: orders from Period 10 (119), Period 11 (44), Period 13 (107), and Period 17 (29) are now considered lost as they have exceeded even the stretched lead times observed in history (L=3+). This results in a pipeline inflation of 299 units. The actual lead time has shown extreme volatility, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but for safety against frequent stockouts and late arrivals, an explicit L of 3 is used. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) horizon (4 periods * ~98.5 demand = 394). To compensate for the 299 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline that the OR backend still thinks will arrive, I am increasing mu_hat significantly (394 + 299 = 693). This ensures the OR backend places an order that maintains availability despite the false pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed pipeline inflation: 299 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29). Planning lead time for safety remains 3 periods despite recent P18/P19 shipments arriving in 1 period, as lead time history is highly inconsistent.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of lost shipments. Historically, shipments from Periods 10 (119), 11 (44), 13 (107), and 17 (29) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 299 units. These units are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 619, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 320 units (619 - 299). The backend OR engine is unaware of these losses and will subtract the full 619 units from its base stock calculation, leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods) using the recent demand mean (~100 units/period) and a safety buffer, then add the 299 lost units back. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (100 * 4) + (Safety Buffer ~100) = 500. Adjusted mu_hat = 500 + 299 = 799. I set L=3 as the planning lead time due to the extreme inconsistency and recent stockouts. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed pipeline inflation total is 299 units (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29) which are effectively lost; OR parameters must adjust mu_hat upward to prevent the backend from under-ordering.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system reports on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit inventory is 829 units. However, based on the history and previous carry-over insights, we have confirmed that a total of 299 units are lost or indefinitely delayed (Period 10: 119, Period 11: 44, Period 13: 107, Period 17: 29). The backend OR engine calculates order quantities using (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). If the pipeline is overinflated by 299 units, the engine will under-order or not order at all, leading to stockouts. To correct this, I am setting L to 3 (the planning lead time) and mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My calculation for mu_hat is: (1 + L) * average_demand + lost_units. Recent demand (P17-P22) averages approximately 97 units. Thus, (1 + 3) * 97 + 299 = 388 + 299 = 687. This explicit mu_hat forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock by counteracting the phantom pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to account for recent demand volatility and provide a sufficient safety buffer given the zero on-hand balance.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory includes 299 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29). The OR backend calculates orders using 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend sees an inflated pipeline of 698 (74 on-hand + 624 in-transit), it will under-order or order 0 unless \u03bc\u0302 is adjusted upward to compensate for the 299 missing units. Recent demand (P19-P23) has averaged 106 units per period. Using a planning lead time of L=3 (to account for historical variability) and a 100-unit per-period demand estimate, the 'true' base stock needs to be around (3+1)*100 = 400. However, to offset the 299 ghost units, I must set \u03bc\u0302 to approximately 700. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 700 to ensure the backend places an order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (demand range 83-131).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation total confirmed at 299 units (P10, P11, P13, P17). These units are effectively lost, requiring mu_hat compensation to prevent stockouts.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a stabilized demand regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is 100.2 units. The pipeline inventory currently stands at 450 units, but this is significantly inflated by lost shipments from Periods 10, 11, 13, and 17, totaling 299 units (119 + 44 + 107 + 29). These units have exceeded any reasonable lead time (up to 14 periods) and will not arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a planning lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand). Total demand needed = 100.2 * 3 = 300.6. To compensate for the 299 lost units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 300.6 + 299 = 599.6. I will use L=2 (default) as the most recent shipments (P21, P22) arrived in 2 periods, though I monitor for further drift. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (last 10 periods) to maintain a high service level.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 99 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is 450 units, but historical analysis confirms that 299 units are permanently lost (from Periods 10, 11, 13, and 17), making the effective pipeline only 151 units (from Period 24). The demand remains stable with a recent mean of approximately 99 units. To compensate for the 299 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as incoming inventory, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. Using an effective lead time (L) of 3 for safety, the base stock targets (L+1) periods of demand. The adjusted mu_hat is calculated as: ((L+1) * Mean Demand) + Lost Units = (4 * 99) + 299 = 396 + 299 = 695. This ensures the backend places an order despite the phantom inventory. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain precise control over this compensation strategy.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the current on-hand inventory is 8 units. We have a significant 'In-transit' quantity of 634 units, but carry-over insights confirm that 299 of these units (from Periods 10, 11, 13, and 17) are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed. Additionally, the shipment from Period 24 (36 units) has reached its promised lead time of 2 periods but hasn't arrived (it would arrive during Period 26 and be visible now if lead time were 2). Lead times have been highly inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will set L to 3 (the reliable safety lead time) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mu_hat calculation is: (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=3, expected demand ~100 (based on the recent stable regime), and 299 lost units, mu_hat = (4 * 100) + 299 = 699. This ensures the base stock level accounts for the missing inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the volatility has remained relatively consistent within the current demand regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 690 units. However, consistent history shows that 299 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29). The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. The demand mean over the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 101.5 units. With an effective planning lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*demand would be ~304. To compensate for the 299 lost units, I need to set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - (690 - 299) = actual_need'. Or more simply, since 299 units are permanently missing from the 690, I must add roughly 299 units to the expected demand across the lead time. Expected (1+L)*mu is 3 * 101.5 = 304.5. Adding 299 gives 603.5. I will set mu_hat to 604 to ensure the order covers current demand despite the pipeline inflation. L is set to 2 (promised) to avoid over-calculating safety stock, while using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to manage the lost inventory crisis.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 690 units. However, based on the history of 'conclude' messages, we have confirmed losses totaling 299 units (Period 10: 119, Period 11: 44, Period 13: 107, Period 17: 29). These units will never arrive, yet the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes them. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value that exceeds (base_stock + lost_units). The current demand regime (last 10 periods) averages 102.8 units. With a planning lead time (L) of 3 (due to frequent variability/delays), the base stock calculation targets (1+3) = 4 periods of demand. Using a safety-conscious demand estimate of ~105/period, target base stock is roughly 420 units. Adding the 299 lost units gives 719. Since current pipeline is 690 and on-hand is 0, the backend will only order if mu_hat is high enough. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 750 to trigger a replenishment of approximately 60 units (750 - 690). I set L to 3 and sigma_hat to explicit 50 to maintain a high service level given recent stockouts.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing severe stockouts due to a significant volume of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (299 units total from Periods 10, 11, 13, and 17). At Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0, and the reported in-transit of 793 units is heavily inflated by these 299 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on a current demand mean of approximately 102 units (average of the last 15 periods) and a safety lead time of 3 periods (Total Periods = L+1 = 4). Target Pipeline = 102 * 4 = 408 units. To compensate for the 299 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat to 408 + 299 = 707. This ensures the backend orders enough to reach the true required base stock. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent risk of 3-period arrivals observed in the history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains stable at approximately 100-110 units (recent mean ~103). The 'In-transit' figure of 690 units is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments (Periods 10, 11, 13, 17 totaling 299 units) and likely the large order from Period 26 (184 units) which is now at L=5 and potentially lost or severely delayed. To compensate for these 'ghost' units in the backend's pipeline calculation (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), I am setting L=3 to ensure a higher safety stock and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the required mu_hat by taking the expected demand over (L+1) periods (4 * 103 = 412) and adding the known lost/stalled pipeline units (299 + 184 = 483) to 'neutralize' them in the backend logic. This results in a mu_hat of 895. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total likely lost units now 483 (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, and now P26: 184 at L=5). Demand mean remains stable near 103 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a massive pipeline inflation issue. History confirms that shipments from Period 10 (119), Period 11 (44), Period 13 (107), Period 17 (29), and Period 26 (184) are likely lost, totaling 483 units. These 'ghost' units in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation prevent it from ordering enough to meet actual demand. Demand remains relatively stable but showed a recent spike (154 in P31), with a long-term average around 103 units. To compensate for the 483-unit pipeline deficit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value: (Planned Lead Time + 1) * Average Demand + Lost Units. With L=3, (4 * 103) + 483 = 895. I will use L=3 for safety planning given the history of delays and losses, even though recent shipments arrived faster. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed pipeline inflation is 483 units due to lost shipments (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26). Demand mean is stable near 103 units, though P31 showed a peak of 154.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains relatively stable with a recent mean of approximately 103 units, though Period 31 saw a spike to 154. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The primary challenge is the significant pipeline inflation caused by lost shipments. As of Period 32, five orders (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184) totaling 483 units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (L>=5). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will incorrectly subtract these 483 'phantom' units from the target, leading to perpetual stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods of demand) using the mean demand of 103: (4 * 103) = 412. To this, I add the 483 lost units to 'neutralize' the backend's subtraction, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 895. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a safety buffer during this volatile lead-time period. L is set to 3 to reflect the safe planning horizon given recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed pipeline inflation is 483 units due to lost shipments (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26). mu_hat must be adjusted upward by this amount to offset the OR engine's subtraction of these units from the order quantity.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 103 units, though recent volatility is noted (e.g., P31 demand of 154). The primary operational challenge remains 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost shipments are 483 units (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184). These units are visible in the 'In-transit' count (938 units) but will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (938) from the target base stock, it will significantly under-order or not order at all, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * average_demand + lost_units. With a planning lead time (L) of 3, (1 + 3) * 103 + 483 = 412 + 483 = 895. This value forces the backend to recognize the need for new orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility while ignoring early game noise.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed pipeline inflation is 483 units due to lost shipments (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26). mu_hat must be adjusted upward by this amount to offset the OR engine's subtraction of these units from the order quantity.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has been steady, though P31 saw a spike to 154. The core challenge is 'pipeline inflation'. Historical shipments from Periods 10, 11, 13, 17, and 26 (totaling 483 units) are significantly overdue (L >= 5 to L >= 24) and are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (938 units) from its target base stock, it believes we are overstocked and is under-ordering. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base demand over the (L+1) horizon (where L=2) using the recent stable mean of ~103 units. Base mu_hat = (2+1) * 103 = 309. To offset the 483 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I add them to this value: 309 + 483 = 792. This ensures the OR engine places an order to meet actual demand. I set sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to provide a safety buffer for recent volatility, and L to 2 to align with the backend's expected lead time while managing the phantom inventory manually.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is stable around 100 units. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 920 units, which is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of the history confirms that shipments from P10 (119), P11 (44), P13 (107), P17 (29), and P26 (184) have never arrived and are well past any reasonable lead time, totaling 483 lost units. Additionally, the shipment from P27 (92 units) is now at L=9 and the shipment from P31 (230 units) is at L=5; given the history, these are also likely lost or severely delayed. The backend OR logic subtracts the entire 'In-transit' (920) from the target base stock. If we do not compensate, the system will not place any new orders, leading to prolonged stockouts. I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers the expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) plus the 483 confirmed lost units. This forces the backend to see a higher requirement, effectively 'neutralizing' the phantom inventory. I am using recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility (which includes a peak of 154 in P31).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed lost units 483 (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26). P27 (92 units) and P31 (230 units) are now also highly suspect at L=9 and L=5 respectively. Effective lead time for planning remains 3 periods due to extreme inconsistency.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are facing a significant stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue remains 'pipeline inflation' caused by lost or severely delayed shipments. The OR backend calculates the order as: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). Currently, 'In-transit' is 920 units. However, based on the history, 805 of these units are likely lost (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184, P27: 92, P31: 230). Specifically, P27 (92 units) is at L=10 and P31 (230 units) is at L=6, well beyond the 2-period promise and the observed 3-period planning lead time. The remaining 115 units in transit are from more recent periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting L=3 (as established for safety) and using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the baseline mu_hat as (1+L) * avg_demand (approx 4 * 103 = 412) and add the 805 lost units to it (412 + 805 = 1217). This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the fact that those 805 units will never arrive. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units increased to 805 (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184, P27: 92, P31: 230). Demand mean remains stable at ~103 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable, with a long-term average around 103 units. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. Based on the 'conclude' messages, we have confirmed that several past orders are effectively lost or permanently delayed (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31), totaling 805 units. These 'ghost units' still reside in the OR backend's 'in-transit' calculation (Pipeline Inventory), causing it to believe we are well-stocked when we are actually facing a stockout. To force the backend to place an order despite these phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock as (L+1) * mean_demand + Safety_Stock + Lost_Units. With L=3, mean=103, and lost units=805, the required base stock is roughly (4 * 103) + (1.64 * 1.41 * 20) + 805 \u2248 1263. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value near this level offsets the 805 unit pipeline inflation. L is set to 3 to reflect the frequent delivery delays beyond the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units remains at 805 (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184, P27: 92, P31: 230). Order from P29 arrived in 1 period, but P32 and P33 took 3 and 2 respectively, confirming planning lead time should remain 3.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we have 255 units on-hand and 963 units in-transit. However, the pipeline is severely inflated by lost shipments from Periods 10, 11, 13, 17, 26, 27, and 31, totaling 805 units (119+44+107+29+184+92+230). These units will never arrive but are subtracted by the OR engine from the base stock. To compensate, I must artificially inflate 'mu_hat'. The demand mean is stable around 103 units. For a planning lead time of L=3, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*103 = 412. Adding the 805 lost units requires a mu_hat of 1217. I will use the 'explicit' method to ensure the backend places an order that accounts for these phantom units in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (standard for this volatility) to maintain a healthy safety stock given lead time inconsistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 219 units and a massive pipeline of 962 units. However, history confirms that a significant portion of this pipeline is composed of lost shipments. Specifically, shipments from Period 10 (119), Period 11 (44), Period 13 (107), Period 17 (29), Period 26 (184), Period 27 (92), and Period 31 (230) have not arrived despite substantial lead times (ranging from 9 to 30 periods). This results in a total of 805 units that are 'phantom' inventory. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its calculated base stock; to prevent the system from under-ordering or stopping orders entirely due to these lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. The current demand mean is stable around 103 units per period. With a planning lead time of 3 (L=3), the base mu_hat (1+L)*103 = 412. I add the 805 lost units to this, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1217. I set L=3 to maintain a safety buffer against the highly inconsistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units remains at 805 (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). Effective planning lead time remains 3 periods due to extreme delivery variance.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 103 units. However, we are facing a significant supply chain issue: pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 805 units that are confirmed or highly likely lost (Orders from P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, and P31). Since the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, it would under-order significantly if we did not intervene. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand (approx 412 units) plus the 805 'ghost' units, totaling 1217. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to cover real demand despite the presence of lost items in the pipeline calculation. I am setting L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed lead time volatility, which ranges from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory is currently 1157 units, but a significant portion (805 units) is confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on historical analysis (orders from P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, and P31). The OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To prevent the engine from incorrectly assuming these lost units will arrive and subsequently under-ordering, I am adjusting mu_hat upward by the volume of the lost shipments (805). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 103 units per period (last 10 periods mean: 102.7). Using L=3 for planning purposes to account for the high variance and frequent delays observed in the conclusion messages (e.g., P32 took 3 periods, P37 took 1). I will use mu_hat = (1+L) * 103 + 805 = 412 + 805 = 1217. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 43. Demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 103 units based on recent history (P31-P42). The critical issue remains the massive 'In-transit' figure of 1249 units, which includes 805 units from confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). Without adjustment, the OR backend's logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will result in zero orders because it 'sees' 1249 units coming, whereas only 444 units (1249 - 805) are actually viable pipeline inventory. To compensate and ensure the backend places an order to meet future demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: Target mu_hat = (Actual Forecasted Demand for L+1 periods) + (Ghost Pipeline Inventory). With a safety planning lead time of L=3, L+1 = 4. mu_hat = (4 * 103) + 805 = 412 + 805 = 1217. L is set to 3 to reflect the high variability and risk of delay seen throughout the game. Sigma_hat is set to 40 using the 'explicit' method to provide a buffer for the recent demand volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains stable at an average of ~103 units. The primary challenge is the significant pipeline inflation caused by lost shipments. As established in previous periods, shipments from P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, and P31 (totaling 805 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they have far exceeded the observed maximum lead time. Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' quantity (currently 1173) from the calculated base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (Expected Demand for L+1 periods) + (Lost Units). With planning L=3, L+1=4. Expected demand = 4 * 103 = 412. Lost units = 805. Total mu_hat = 1217. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the current stockout and the fact that 805 units in the 'pipeline' will never arrive. Lead time L is set to 'explicit' 3 to maintain a safety buffer against the high delivery variance (1 to 3 periods observed recently). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units remains at 805 (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). Order from P40 arrived in 3 periods, supporting the planning lead time of 3.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Period 45. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with a long-term mean around 103 units. On-hand inventory is low (11 units). Pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by 805 units from confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). 

Lead Time Analysis: The promised lead time is 2, but recent actual arrivals (P40, P41) confirmed 3 periods. I will set L=3 to maintain a safety buffer against this delivery inconsistency.

OR Backend Strategy: The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the 805 units in the pipeline will never arrive, the backend will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=3 and expected demand ~103, this is (4 * 103) + 805 = 1217. This forces the backend to recognize the lost stock as 'already spent'. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable around 100-103 units per period (last 10 periods average ~101). The primary challenge is the significant pipeline inflation caused by lost shipments. Currently, 805 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, these 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to cover both the demand for the planning horizon (L+1 periods) and the lost pipeline volume (805 units). With a planning lead time L=3, the horizon is 4 periods. Expected demand = 4 * 103 = 412. Adjusted mu_hat = 412 + 805 = 1217. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during delivery variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation remains at 805 units (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). Order from P42 (92 units) is now at L=4 and also suspect, but I am maintaining the 805 unit correction for now to avoid over-ordering until L=5 is reached. Demand mean is stable at ~103.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high demand (~103 units). The primary challenge is 'pipeline inflation': 805 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31). Additionally, the order from P42 (92 units) is now at L=5 without arrival, confirming it is also lost. This brings the total lost units to 897. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1245 units) from its base stock calculation, it will severely under-order if we do not compensate. I set L=3 for safety and mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With a mean demand of ~103 and L=3, the target base stock should be roughly 412. To offset the 897 phantom units in the pipeline, mu_hat is set to 1309. This ensures the backend places a meaningful order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units increased to 897 (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184, P27: 92, P31: 230, and now P42: 92 at L=5). Demand mean remains stable at ~103 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 103 units over the long term. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. I have confirmed that 897 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are lost or indefinitely delayed (Orders from P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31, and P42). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the target base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (897) to prevent the backend from generating zero-quantity orders. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delivery delays beyond the promised 2 periods. The mu_hat calculation is (1+L)*103 + 897 = 4*103 + 897 = 412 + 897 = 1309. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (approx 15 units std) over the lead time: sqrt(4)*15 = 30.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units increased to 897 (P10: 119, P11: 44, P13: 107, P17: 29, P26: 184, P27: 92, P31: 230, P42: 92). Demand mean remains stable at ~103 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 1231 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 897 of these units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31, P42). This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 334 units (1231 - 897). The demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 103 units. The actual lead time fluctuates significantly between 1 and 3 periods; I am maintaining the planning lead time (L) at 3 to provide a safety buffer against the frequent 3-period arrivals. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must adjust the mu_hat parameter. The OR engine calculates the order as base_stock - pipeline. To offset the 897 lost units, I set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean + 897. With L=3 and mean=103, (4 * 103) + 897 = 412 + 897 = 1309. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to input this corrected value. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture current volatility while ignoring the massive outlier from P31.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 103 units based on the last 20 periods. The primary challenge remains the 'pipeline inflation' caused by lost or severely delayed shipments. As of Period 50, the cumulative lost units are estimated at 897 (P10, P11, P13, P17, P26, P27, P31, and P42). These 897 units are included in the 'In-transit' count of 1247, but will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from subtracting these phantom units from the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=3 and mean=103, the base mu_hat would be 412. Adding the 897 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1309. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) as it is the most frequent and reliable planning horizon given recent history. Sigma_hat is set to the default to capture standard volatility around the mean.
