Demand Analysis: Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111) and recent demand [108, 74, 119] (mean ~100) are relatively consistent. There is no evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit = 141 (P1) + 137 (P2) + 139 (P3) = 417. Total pipeline inventory is 417.\n4. Strategy: The OR algorithm recommends 139 units. Based on a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 500-550 units. With 417 units in transit, adding 139 units brings the total inventory position to 556. This aligns perfectly with covering the lead time plus a small safety stock. \n5.

Currently, no orders have arrived yet (Ending On-hand is 0 for all periods). We are in Period 5, so we expect the Period 1 order (141 units) to satisfy current Period 5 demand. \n2. Inventory Analysis: Total In-transit is 556 units (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4). This covers the pipeline for the next 4 periods. On-hand is currently 0, which is expected given the lead time. \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demands were [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Recent demands are [108, 74, 119, 124]. Average demand remains approximately 105-110 units per period. \n4. Strategy & OR Reconcile: The OR recommendation is 25 units. This is low because the OR algorithm sees a large pipeline (556) relative to its base-stock target. However, since we are at Period 5, the first shipment is only just arriving. To maintain a steady pipeline and account for the (L+1) = 5 period coverage needed, we should target roughly 110 units per period.

Demand Analysis: The historical demand samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) average 111.4 units. However, recent demand (P5-P9) has been lower: 51, 67, 103, 92, 100 (average 82.6). The previous carry-over insight noted a shift to ~78, but P7-P9 are slightly higher. I will estimate average demand at ~90 units/period.\n4.

Strategic Adjustment: My target stock level to cover 5 periods (L+1) based on the recent regime (82 units/period) is approximately 410 units. With 386 units already accounted for, an order of 24 units would reach that target. However, the OR's capped recommendation of 137 aims to build a larger safety buffer.

No significant calendar events or shifts are detected for the final 5 periods.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 25.

Orders placed after P46 (P47-P50) will arrive after the game ends and should be minimized or zeroed to avoid holding costs on inventory that cannot be sold.\n5. **Required Stock for P50 Arrival**: We need to cover demand for Period 50.

Therefore, these units would only incur procurement costs without providing any revenue or impacting the final score positively. Analyzing the current pipeline: On-hand is 33 units. In-transit units from P44 (81 units), P45 (106 units), and P46 (103 units) are scheduled to arrive in P48, P49, and P50 respectively. This total supply (33 + 81 + 106 + 103 = 323 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50), which averages ~100-110 units per period.
