Based on the definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 5's resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, I have 0 on-hand inventory and 417 units in-transit. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111) is consistent with observed demand in Periods 1-3 [108, 74, 119] (mean ~100). There is no significant regime shift yet. 3. Inventory Strategy: Since on-hand is 0 and the first arrival isn't expected until Period 5 (visible Period 6), I am currently stocking out. However, I must maintain the pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). 4. OR Review: The OR recommendation of 139 units is based on the capped base-stock policy. Given that my in-transit (417) covers roughly 4 periods of demand (~100-110 per period), and I need to cover 5 periods (L+1), adding the OR recommendation of 139 brings the total pipeline to 556 units. 556 / 5 = 111.2 units per period, which aligns almost perfectly with the historical mean.

We currently have 556 units in-transit (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4: 141+137+139+139). \n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] averages ~111.4. Actual demands in P1-P4 [108, 74, 119, 124] average ~106. The demand appears relatively stable with moderate variance. \n3. Inventory Positioning: We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all sales in P1-P4 due to the lead-time gap. The pipeline (556 units) covers roughly 5 periods of demand (~111 * 5 = 555). Total inventory needed to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5) at a target safety level is the base stock. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommendation of 25 units is very low because the algorithm sees a massive pipeline (556) relative to its calculated base stock for a 4-period lead time. However, to maintain a steady flow and account for the 106-111 mean demand, we should ensure we don't under-order and create a future gap.

The in-transit pipeline is significantly higher at 410 units, consisting of orders from P34 (100), P35 (62), P36 (116), and P37 (132). Expected arrival for P38's resolution phase is the P34 order (100 units).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand from the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 104 units, slightly lower than the P11-P15 surge but higher than early game averages. Recent demand has fluctuated between 80 and 154 units. \n4. **Strategy**: The base-stock target for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a mean of ~104 is roughly 520 units. Total pipeline + on-hand is currently 458 (410 + 48). To reach a target that covers the lead time plus safety stock, an order is necessary. \n5. **Adjustment**: The OR algorithm recommends 95 units. However, looking at the pipeline, the order from P37 (132 units) was quite large. Adding 95 units brings the total exposure to 553 units. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0 (critical fractile 0.8), we want to avoid stockouts but also minimize excess holding.
