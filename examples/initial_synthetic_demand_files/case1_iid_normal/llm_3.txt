My current pipeline (672) already covers this. However, since I am in a stockout state and the first arrival isn't until P5, I need to ensure I don't under-order for the long term.

In-transit consists of orders from P41 (70 arriving P45), P42 (120 arriving P46), P43 (110 arriving P47), P44 (110 arriving P48). Pipeline assessment: P45: 39 (start) + 70 (arrival) - ~105 (demand) = ~4 left. P46: 4 (start) + 120 (arrival) - ~105 (demand) = ~19 left. P47: 19 (start) + 110 (arrival) - ~105 (demand) = ~24 left. P48: 24 (start) + 110 (arrival) - ~105 (demand) = ~29 left. To cover Period 49 demand, I need an order placed in P45. Demand for P49 is expected around 110. Starting inventory for P49 will be ~29, so I need ~81 units to minimize stockouts while keeping holding costs low. I will order 90 to provide a small safety buffer.",

(c) Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P41 arrived at P45 conclude). (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand is dangerously low (6 units). Pipeline includes arrivals due in P46 (ordered P42: 120 units), P47 (ordered P43: 110 units), P48 (ordered P44: 110 units), and P49 (ordered P45: 90 units). (e) Order logic: We are in P46 of 50. Orders placed now will arrive in P50 (P46+4). We need to cover demand for P50. Total demand for P46-P50 (5 periods) at ~105/period is 525 units. Current On-hand (6) + In-transit (430) = 436 units. To maintain service levels through P50, we need to bridge the gap (525 - 436 = 89). An order of 100 units is appropriate to ensure we don't stock out in the final period while accounting for potential demand spikes.",

The demonstrated lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. As of Period 47, we are approaching the game end (Period 50), which necessitates a shift in inventory strategy: we must ensure demand is met through Period 50 while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Expected arrivals based on the 4-period lead time are: P47: 110 units (ordered P43), P48: 110 units (ordered P44), P49: 90 units (ordered P45), P50: 100 units (ordered P46). Total projected supply for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) is 21 (on-hand) + 110 + 110 + 90 + 100 = 431 units. Projected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 4 * 105 = 420 units. Since the order placed today (Period 47) would only arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends), any order placed now will only incur holding costs and will not contribute to revenue. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 units to maximize profit and minimize waste.",

We must satisfy remaining demand using only the current on-hand inventory and existing in-transit shipments. Currently, we have 9 units on-hand. Looking at the in-transit pipeline: Period 44 order (110 units) is due in Period 48; Period 45 order (90 units) is due in Period 49; Period 46 order (100 units) is due in Period 50. Demand has recently averaged around 100-110 units per period. The arrival of 110 units during the current period (from Period 44's order) will provide enough stock for Period 48's demand.

Therefore, any order placed now will only incur procurement costs or simply remain in-transit without contributing to profit or being charged holding costs (depending on system interpretation), but most importantly, it cannot satisfy Period 50 demand. However, a 100-unit shipment ordered in Period 46 is scheduled to arrive during Period 50's Arrival Resolution phase. This arrival will be available to satisfy Period 50 demand.
