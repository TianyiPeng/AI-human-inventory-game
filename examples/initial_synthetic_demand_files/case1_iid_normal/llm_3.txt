Looking at the pipeline: Orders from P39 (150 units), P40 (50 units), P41 (100 units), and P42 (100 units) are currently 'live'. The order from P39 has reached 3 periods of lead time without arrival; while 3 periods is the historical maximum, the frequent loss of orders suggests a significant risk that it or other pipeline units will not arrive. However, with 193 units on hand and 50% of the 400 pipeline units expected to arrive, I have enough stock to cover roughly 3-4 periods of demand. Given we are at Period 43 of 50, I need to ensure coverage until the end without incurring excessive holding costs on a product that costs $1/unit/period.

In Period 43, the on-hand inventory is 160. The order from Period 39 (150 units) is now 4 periods old; since the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, this order is officially confirmed lost. The 'live' pipeline now only consists of orders from P41 (100 units), P42 (100 units), and P43 (100 units). Considering a 50% survival rate, we can only expect about 150 of those 300 units to arrive. To cover the remaining 7 periods (up to P50) and maintain a safety buffer against the high loss rate, I need to ensure a steady inflow. Total expected demand for the rest of the game is ~700-750 units. Total projected inventory (On-hand 160 + Expected Pipeline 150) is only 310 units.
