Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we start with no on-hand or in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. The initial demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.5. For Period 1, I will use 'default' settings for lead time (L=2) and demand statistics. This allows the backend to calculate the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level (q = 0.8), which is appropriate for a snack category like chips.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 2. Historical demand data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the recently observed demand of 108 in Period 1 (visible in the Period 1 conclude message) suggests a stable demand regime with a mean of approximately 111 units. Since we started with 0 on-hand inventory, we experienced lost sales in Period 1. The 141 units ordered in P1 are in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (L=2). To ensure service levels for the (L+1) horizon (Periods 2, 3, and 4), I will use 'default' for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to calculate parameters based on the full sample history. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand, accounting for the 141 units already in the pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (141 units) should arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4) and the Period 2 order (137 units) should arrive during Period 4 (visible at start of Period 5). Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 278 units in transit. Demand for Period 1 was 108 and Period 2 was 74. Combined with historical data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean demand is approx 105. Since we haven't confirmed any arrivals yet (normal for L=2), I will stick to the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent behavior while including the latest two observations (108, 74) alongside the provided history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the game mechanics, the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms a delay or deviation from the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (108, 74, 119) is not being met. Total in-transit is 353 (141+137+75). I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the observed delay (P1 order hasn't arrived by P3's conclusion, meaning it will arrive P4 or later). Demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus historical game demands [108, 74, 119] shows a mean of approx 107. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this baseline while the OR engine accounts for the pipeline. mu_hat will be calculated as (1+3)*mean.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, we have observed a variability in lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while the Period 2 order also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). This indicates an average actual lead time of 2.5 periods, slightly longer than the promised 2. Demand over the last 5 periods (including historical: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94 and game: 108, 74, 119, 124) shows a mean of approximately 109. Since the lead time is fluctuating, I will use 'explicit' for L set to 3 to be conservative and ensure the pipeline covers the longer observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the game history plus one prior point) to capture the current demand level of ~111 per period, resulting in a base stock target covering (1+3) periods. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable: P1 order took 3 periods, P2 order took 2 periods. Average actual lead time ~2.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the order from Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while the order from Period 2 arrived in 2 periods, confirming lead-time instability (average ~2.5 periods). The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) and the recorded history (108, 74, 119, 124, 51) suggests a mean demand of approximately 103 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 103 and 296 units in transit, we must set parameters to bridge the gap for a lead time of 2-3 periods. I will use L=3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~104). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high variability with recent values (51, 67) being lower than the initial historical mean (approx 110). Specifically, the last 3 periods average ~80.6, while the overall average including past data is ~101. Lead time (L) is unstable: observed lead times are 3, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2.67. This exceeds the promised 2 periods. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat, where mu_hat represents demand over (L+1) periods. To account for the lead time extension, I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to ensure the system covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the downward trend in demand while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Sigma_hat will use the default method to maintain a conservative safety stock given the lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed unstable/extended: Observed L values are [3, 2, 3] for orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we review the demand for 'chips(Regular)' and the lead time performance. Demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 119, 124, 51, 67, 103) has a mean of 92.8, which is lower than the initial historical average of ~111. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are [3, 2, 3, 2] for orders from P1, P2, P3, and P5. The order from P4 is missing (ordered 109 in P4, not arrived by P7 conclude), suggesting a delay or loss. The average observed lead time is 2.5 periods. To be conservative and account for the instability/missing P4 shipment, I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover demand over 4 periods (L+1), helping to bridge the gap caused by the missing P4 order and the current in-transit level (184 units).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable with a mix of 2 and 3 periods (Average 2.5); Period 4 order (109 units) is potentially lost or significantly delayed (4 periods elapsed without arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the context shows 'chips(Regular)' has a volatile lead time. Analysis of concluding messages shows actual lead times of [3, 2, 3, 2, 2] for orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 respectively. The order from Period 4 (109 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since placement), suggesting it is likely lost. Current on-hand inventory is 63. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 271) includes the likely-lost Period 4 order (109), the Period 7 order (40), and the Period 8 order (122). Removing the lost 109 units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 162. Historical demand is relatively stable, with the last 5 periods [51, 67, 103, 92, 112] (including pre-history) averaging ~95. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2.5 to reflect the observed instability and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=8) to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the (L+1) horizon effectively despite the missing shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 4 order (109 units) confirmed as lost shipment (5 periods elapsed with no arrival vs. max observed L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 9. Looking at historical lead times, arrivals have occurred at L=2 (Periods 2, 5, 6) and L=3 (Periods 1, 3), with Period 4's order confirmed lost. The average actual lead time is 2.4. I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the stockout and the history of 3-period arrivals. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) has averaged 82.6 units per period, while the overall average is 93.8. There is a slight downward trend in recent demand (51, 67, 103, 92, 100), but the last three periods show a return to higher levels. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent behavior while accounting for the extended lead time (L=3). This means mu_hat will cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) will capture the recent volatility to help the OR backend maintain a sufficient service level to recover from the current stockout.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 83 units with 207 units in-transit (ordered in P9, P10). Historical demand for the last 5 periods [67, 103, 92, 100, 79] averages 88.2 units, which is a decrease compared to the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (average 111.4). The lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2). The average observed lead time is 2.43 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for this drift. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent lower demand regime (avg ~88) compared to the long-term average. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) is sensitive to the current downward trend in demand while hedging against the variable arrival times.

Historically, lead times vary between 2 and 3 periods (average ~2.5), and the shipment from Period 4 (109 units) is confirmed lost. Currently, orders from Period 9 (30 units), Period 10 (68 units), and Period 11 (57 units) are in-transit. For Period 12's decision, we must account for the high demand volatility and the fact that we are currently stocked out. Historical demand mean is approx 94.5 over the last 11 periods. Since lead time varies, I will set L to 3 to be conservative and prevent further stockouts. I'll use a recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current variability, which has seen several spikes above 100 recently. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=5 will also ensure the OR backend accounts for the current high variance to maintain a higher service level.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P9, P11, P12). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' inventory of 360 units. Analysis shows this includes the 109 units ordered in Period 4, which were confirmed lost in Period 9 (5+ periods elapsed without arrival). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (including the lost 109 units) from the base stock, it will consistently under-order by 109 units unless we compensate. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Usually, mu_hat = (1 + L) * mean_demand. With an average lead time of 2.5 (L=2.5) and mean demand of ~100, a standard mu_hat would be 350. To force the OR engine to account for the 109 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat = 350 + 109 = 459. For L, I use 'explicit' value 2.5 to reflect the observed alternating 2-3 period lead times. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to handle the standard volatility of the demand history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand. The total pipeline inventory is high (496 units), reflecting recent aggressive ordering to recover. Lead time analysis from the 'conclude' messages shows a mix of 2 and 3 periods: P1(3), P2(2), P3(3), P5(2), P6(2), P7(3), P8(2), P9(3). This averages to 2.5 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to provide a conservative buffer against this instability and to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals. Demand remains relatively stable; the mean of all 18 samples (including pre-game) is 101.3. For mu_hat, I'll use the 'default' method which calculates (1+L) * mean of all samples, providing a coverage of 4 periods (~405 units) which is appropriate given the current in-transit volume and the need to restore service levels. Sigma_hat is also set to default to capture the overall volatility. The Period 4 order (109 units) remains lost, and our calculations correctly ignore it in the pipeline by focusing on the 'conclude' confirmations.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains unstable, alternating between 2 and 3 periods (Average ~2.5). Frequent stockouts observed due to lead time variability and high demand periods (P11-P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable but high, averaging approximately 98 units over the last 10 periods. The historical demand for all 14 periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119, 102, 128]. The lead time (L) is unstable, alternating between 2 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.5. Based on observed arrivals (P1:3, P2:2, P3:3, P5:2, P6:2, P7:3, P8:2, P9:3, P12:2), I will set L to 2.5 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient window. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~98). The pipeline inventory is currently 370 (from orders in P10, P11, P13, and P14, excluding the lost P4 order). Since the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will subtract this pipeline, setting an explicit L=2.5 and mu_hat based on N=10 will help maintain a higher service level to mitigate frequent stockouts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a period of stockouts (P11-P13, P15) despite a high in-transit pipeline of 376 units. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averages 116.6 units, while the full history average is approximately 101.5. Given the ongoing stockouts and the inconsistency in lead times (alternating between 2 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.5), I will set L to 3 to be conservative and ensure the pipeline covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent_N of 10 to capture the slightly higher demand observed in the middle-to-late stage of the game (approx. 102/period). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N of 10 to reflect recent volatility. The high in-transit balance (376) suggests significant arrivals are pending from orders placed in P11 (57 units), P13 (136 units), P14 (0 units), and P15 (6 units), plus potentially the large order from P12 (already arrived in P14). Note: P10 order (68 units) should have arrived by P13 if L=3, but P13 conclude showed arrived=0, and P14 conclude only showed the P12 order. This suggests the P10 and P11 orders are delayed or potentially lost. Setting L=3 helps the OR backend maintain a larger safety buffer against these delays.

Carry-over insight: Potential loss or severe delay of Period 10 (68 units) and Period 11 (57 units) orders confirmed (P15 conclude reached without arrival).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple stockouts in recent periods (P11-P13, P15-P16). The Period 10 and 11 orders (68 and 57 units) are confirmed lost/severely delayed as they have not arrived by P16 conclude (exceeding the observed max lead time of 3). Observed lead times are unstable, alternating between 2 and 3 periods: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2]. The average lead time is 2.5, but to mitigate stockouts caused by variability and lost shipments, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation covers a longer horizon (L+1=4 periods). Demand remains relatively stable around a mean of ~100 (last 5: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture this average (~103) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the demand samples. Setting L to 3 effectively increases the pipeline protection against the 'missing' inventory from lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 106.4 units. However, lead time is highly unstable and shipments are frequently lost. Confirmed lost shipments include P4, P10, and P11. Observed lead times (W) from concluded periods are: [3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2]. This averages approximately 2.33 periods. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent 3-period arrivals and prevents under-ordering. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (approx 103 units/period) while smoothing out recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect recent demand variance. The in-transit pipeline of 438 units is large, but much of it consists of orders from P13 (136 units) and P16 (66 units) which haven't arrived yet; setting L=3 helps the backend prioritize covering the (L+1) period window despite the current zero on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Continued lead time instability (alternating 2-3 periods); P10 (68 units) and P11 (57 units) confirmed lost as of P17 conclude.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of demand across the last several periods. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods: 112, 128, 112, 79, 109, 76). The lead time remains unstable, fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (Average ~2.5), and we have confirmed lost shipments from Periods 4, 10, and 11. To compensate for the lead time instability and the fact that we are currently stocked out, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock (covering L+1=4 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand volatility while smoothing out the noise from recent stockouts where demand was present but 'sold' was zero. This strategy aims to build back safety stock to prevent further lost sales due to delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Continued lead time instability with confirmed losses of orders from P4, P10, and P11. Actual lead time varies between 2 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for 'chips(Regular)' remains precarious with current on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand is relatively stable, averaging 101.4 units over 19 periods (latest demand was 122). The primary challenge is lead time instability and lost shipments. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.4). Specifically, Period 4, 10, 11, and 13 orders appear to be lost, creating a deficit in the pipeline. Although 'In-transit' shows 372 units, this includes several likely lost orders (P10: 68, P11: 57, P13: 136). The OR backend's base-stock calculation uses pipeline inventory (including lost units) to determine orders, which will result in under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) to increase the protection level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=19) to capture the full demand profile and set sigma_hat to 'explicit' (50.0) to provide a higher safety buffer against the high variance in both demand and lead times, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed for orders placed in Periods 4, 10, 11, and 13. Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 99 in Period 20. Historical demand shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 99 units and a standard deviation of 22 units. Lead time is highly volatile and unreliable; although the promised lead time is 2, actual observations vary between 1 and 3 periods, and multiple shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13) have been confirmed lost. To protect against this instability and the resulting stockouts, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the maximum observed lead time. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while ignoring older data. This approach aims to build a higher base stock to buffer against the significant risk of shipment loss and lead time variance, which has consistently depleted inventory in previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and frequent shipment loss (P4, P10, P11, P13) are primary drivers of stockouts; inventory policy must assume a 3-period lead time to maintain service levels.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average of approximately 99.6 units over the last 21 periods. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable, characterized by lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and frequent lost shipments (Orders from Periods 4, 10, 11, and 13 are confirmed lost). Currently, On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 458 units in-transit. To mitigate the frequent stockouts caused by lead time variability and lost orders, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed reliable lead time) using the 'explicit' method. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand level (avg ~103 units per period) while providing a buffer for the (L+1) period coverage. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters encourage the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to account for the 'missing' pipeline inventory and the risk of further delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Lead times vary between 1-3 periods, and approximately 19% of orders (4 out of 21) have been lost. Safety stock must account for a 3-period lead time to prevent stockouts.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is highly unstable, characterized by volatile lead times (1-3 periods) and frequent lost shipments (approx. 19% loss rate: P4, P10, P11, P13). Period 22 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and no arrivals, continuing a severe stockout streak. In-transit inventory is high (458 units), but reliability is low. To combat frequent stockouts and account for the high variance in delivery, I am setting the lead time parameter (L) to 3 (the observed maximum), which forces the OR backend to calculate base stock for a 4-period window (L+1). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand mean (~100 units/period) while filtering out older noise. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to build a sufficient safety buffer once shipments actually arrive, compensating for the high risk of loss and delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly unreliable. In Period 23, only 18 units arrived (from P21), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Demand remains steady, averaging 101.5 units over the last 23 periods and 102.2 units over the last 10. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 440 units, which includes several orders likely to be lost (P4, P10, P11, P13). As established in previous periods, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, but to mitigate the frequent stockouts caused by this volatility and the ~19% loss rate, I must assume a lead time of 3 for the base stock calculation (L+1=4 periods of coverage). I will use an explicit lead time of 3 and a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand mean of ~102, which ensures the OR backend targets a pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) that accounts for the risk of delayed arrivals. Since the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic doesn't account for known lost shipments in the pipeline inventory, using a conservative L=3 helps provide a higher safety buffer.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' remains highly unstable, characterized by volatile lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and a significant history of lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13). Period 24 concluded with zero on-hand inventory and total stockout, as the order from Period 20 (68 units) has failed to arrive by P24 conclude (4 periods elapsed), suggesting it is likely lost. Current in-transit inventory is 448 units, but given the 19-20% loss rate and timing, availability is precarious. Demand remains steady with a mean of ~99.4 units and standard deviation of ~21.7. To maintain service levels amidst this instability, I am explicitly setting the Lead Time (L) to 3 periods to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the most recent demand regime (approx. 100 units/period) and volatility, while allowing the OR engine's q-ratio (0.8) to determine the safety stock buffer against the high stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Shipment from Period 20 (68 units) is likely lost (4 periods elapsed with no arrival); loss rate remains approx. 20%. Sustained supply instability requires planning for a 3-period lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the inventory position is critical with 0 units on-hand and 448 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 98.8 units, while the lifetime average is 101.4. The supply chain remains highly unstable; although the promised lead time is 2, observed actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, and multiple shipments have been lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, and now likely P20, which is 5 periods overdue). Given that 20% of orders are lost and lead times often hit 3 periods, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand to buffer against these delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the current regime which excludes the initial starting phase but includes the recent volatility, resulting in a stable estimate of ~100 units per period. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=15) to account for the consistent variability in demand (std ~20). These settings aim to force the OR backend to increase the base stock level (L+1 = 4 periods of coverage), which is necessary to overcome the high stockout frequency caused by the combination of lead time jitter and shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 20 (68 units) confirmed lost as of Period 25 conclude (5 periods elapsed). Total lost shipment count is now 5 out of 23 orders (~22% loss rate).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is highly unstable, characterized by a mix of variable lead times (1-3 periods) and frequent lost shipments. As of Period 26 conclude, orders from Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, and 20 (ordered P20, now P27) are confirmed or highly likely lost, representing a ~22% loss rate. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 448 units in-transit, though some of this pipeline is likely comprised of lost units. Historical demand remains relatively stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods: 131, 96, 89, 91, and P22's 83). To mitigate frequent stockouts caused by lead time drift and losses, I am setting the lead time parameter (L) to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon. Demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will be based on the most recent 10 periods to capture current demand levels while smoothing out recent noise.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 5 periods: 131, 96, 89, 91, 113; mean=104). The primary challenge is the supply chain instability: lead times vary between 1-3 periods, and there is a high loss rate (~21%, with 5 out of 24 orders confirmed lost: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 440 units, but many of these units are from periods with high loss probability or significant delays. To protect against stockouts given the volatility, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using the last 20 periods to capture the consistent demand regime while smoothing out the noise from the frequent stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly unreliable, with a mix of variable lead times (1-3 periods) and a high frequency of lost shipments (~22% loss rate). Specifically, orders from Period 4, 10, 11, 13, and 20 are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 440 units in-transit, though the reliability of these units is questionable given history. Demand has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~100. To maximize reward, I must account for the maximum observed lead time (3 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation covers demand until the next reliable arrival. I will use an explicit lead time of 3. For demand, I'll use the recent average of the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the current demand level of ~104 units per period. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that aims for a high service level while the cap prevents excessive over-ordering in this unstable environment.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system is in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand is relatively stable, averaging approximately 101.4 units over the last 29 periods. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable, with a ~22% order loss rate (orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, and P20 are confirmed lost). Actual lead times for fulfilled orders fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the safest conservative estimate for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. Current in-transit inventory is 440 units, which ostensibly covers several periods of demand; however, given the high loss rate, this pipeline is likely inflated by ghost orders that will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend attempts to restore inventory despite the 'In-transit' figure, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed delay and mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the most recent demand mean (~104 units per period). This combination (L=3, mu_hat for L+1 periods) pushes the base stock target toward 416+ units. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative order loss rate confirmed at ~22% (5 lost out of 23 orders). Total confirmed lost orders: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20. These lost units remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely, requiring an aggressive base-stock setting to compensate for the pipeline inflation.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is plagued by frequent shipment losses (approx. 22%) and volatile lead times (1-3 periods). Confirmed lost orders include those from P4, P10, P11, P13, and P20. These lost units (totaling 368 units) are still counted in the backend's 'In-transit' figure of 440, which creates a false sense of security in the pipeline. To counteract this 'phantom inventory' and frequent stockouts, I must set the lead time (L) to 3 periods (the maximum observed) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Average demand is approx. 100 units/period; for L=3, the coverage should be (1+L)*100 = 400. However, I must inflate this to account for the ~368 units trapped in the pipeline that will never arrive. I will set mu_hat to 800 to force the backend to place an order that overcomes the 440 'in-transit' units and target a base stock sufficient for the lead time. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and current demand has spiked to 154 (Period 31), following a period of sustained stockouts. Historical demand (excluding the latest spike) averaged ~101.4, but the recent observation of 154 suggests a significant upward shift. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a ~22% loss rate (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20 confirmed lost) and volatile lead times (1-3 periods). These lost orders inflate the 'In-transit' figure (664 units), tricking the OR backend into thinking the pipeline is full when it is actually empty. To force an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the longest observed lead time and a very high 'explicit' mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * 154 = 616 to cover the current demand peak plus the buffer for lead time, effectively overriding the backend's default calculation which would be paralyzed by the high pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed at Period 31: Demand spiked to 154, a ~50% increase over previous averages. Supply chain remains dysfunctional with ~22% of orders lost; these lost units remain in 'In-transit', necessitating high explicit mu_hat values to bypass the OR engine's pipeline check.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are facing zero on-hand inventory and a demand spike identified in Period 31 (154 units), although Period 32 demand returned to a lower level (90 units). The primary challenge is the supply chain: approximately 22% of orders are lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20), yet these units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (664 units), which prevents the OR backend from placing new orders if it thinks the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds the phantom in-transit inventory plus required stock. With an average demand of ~100 and a 3-period lead time window (L+1=4), the 'real' requirement is ~400 units. However, to force an order despite 664 units 'in-transit', I must set mu_hat significantly higher. I am setting mu_hat to 1000 and L to 3 to signal the backend to order and account for the high lead time variability and historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike of 154 in P31 appears to be an outlier or temporary shift as P32 demand returned to 90. Supply chain remains broken with 664 units 'in-transit' despite 0 on-hand, confirming that the OR backend requires extremely high explicit mu_hat values to overcome phantom inventory from lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely dysfunctional. As of Period 33 conclude, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 948 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, orders from Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, and 20 (totaling 370 units) are confirmed lost. This 'phantom' inventory inflates the OR engine's pipeline calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline), causing it to zero out orders unless base_stock is set extremely high. Demand has stabilized back to a mean of ~100 after the Period 31 outlier (154). To force the backend to place an order that covers 4 periods of demand (L=3 + 1 review period) and bypass the 948 units of in-transit inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1400 (370 lost + 1000 for upcoming demand). This ensures the OR engine calculates a base_stock > 948, allowing for new arrivals. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of actual lead times observed.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is severely disrupted. As of Period 35, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 1332 units in 'In-transit'. This pipeline is heavily inflated by at least six confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and likely others from the recent high-volume orders if they do not arrive). The OR engine's logic (final order = base_stock - pipeline) will prevent any new orders from being placed because the 1332 'in-transit' units far exceed any standard base-stock calculation. To force the backend to place an order and restore on-hand inventory, I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Demand has stabilized after the P31 spike (P32: 90, P33: 87, P34: 80), averaging ~86 units over the last three periods. With an assumed lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock should cover 4 periods of demand (~344 units) plus safety stock. However, to bypass the 1332 units currently in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set significantly higher. I am setting mu_hat to 1800 to ensure an order is generated, aiming to overcome the 'lost' units that the backend still counts as incoming.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation reached critical levels in Period 35 (1332 units in-transit vs 0 on-hand), confirming that previous lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20) and potentially newer ones are blocking the OR engine's order logic. Explicit mu_hat values > 1300 are now required to trigger any procurement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, a shipment of 284 units (ordered in Period 33) arrived, providing the first significant stock in several periods and resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 169. However, the supply chain remains highly unstable. There are currently 1534 units 'In-transit', but at least 589 of these are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (Orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and likely P31 which should have arrived by now given the 2-3 period lead time). The OR backend logic subtracts the entire 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock. To trigger a new order and ensure a steady pipeline despite these 'phantom' units, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) to exceed the total inflated pipeline plus expected demand. Current demand is stable around 100 units/period (P35 demand was 115). I will set an explicit mu_hat of 2000 to overcome the 1534 'in-transit' units and target a buffer that accounts for the frequent shipment losses. L is set to 3 to reflect the realistic upper bound of the volatile lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Pipeline inflation continues at 1534 units. Period 31 order (224 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, bringing the estimated lost shipment total to ~813 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-399.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, a massive arrival of 870 units (from orders in P34 and P35) occurred, leaving on-hand inventory at 911 units. The demand remains stable around 100-110 units (P36 demand was 128). However, the 'In-transit' figure is 997 units, which includes approximately 813 units from confirmed or likely lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and now P31 which is 5 periods overdue). Because the OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, any order would be suppressed unless the mu_hat parameter is set high enough to exceed the sum of on-hand inventory (911) and the phantom pipeline (997). Total 'pipeline inventory' seen by the backend is 1908 units. To avoid over-ordering while we have 911 on-hand (enough for ~8-9 periods), but ensuring the logic doesn't break once this stock depletes, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the actual demand and lead time (L=3), but I must acknowledge that no new order will be placed this period by the backend due to the 1908 units it perceives as available. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slight uptick in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation reached 1908 units in P37 due to 911 on-hand and 997 in-transit (estimated 813 units are lost: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31). Demand remains stable near ~105 units. Lead time for recent successful arrivals has stabilized at 1-2 periods, but 3 remains the safest planning horizon.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we have 814 units on-hand and 997 units in-transit. Based on historical data, approximately 813 units in the 'In-transit' bucket are confirmed lost (Orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P31). These 'phantom' units prevent the OR engine from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. Recent demand has stabilized around 100-110 units (P35-P37), and arrivals have recently shown a lead time of 1-2 periods. To ensure the system places an order when necessary and accounts for the high inventory currently held (814 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Current demand is ~105/period. For a planning horizon of L+1 (4 periods), required stock is ~420. With 814 actual units on-hand, we do not need to order this period. However, to 'clear' the logic of the 813 lost units in-transit, mu_hat must be set relative to (On-hand + Lost units). Currently, On-hand (814) + In-transit (997) = 1811. If I want to maintain a base stock of ~500 (covering demand and safety stock for 4 periods), I would need mu_hat to be very high. Since we have sufficient physical stock (814) to cover several periods of demand (avg 105), the goal is to NOT order while holding costs accrue. I will use 'explicit' values to keep the base stock below the pipeline total to prevent unnecessary ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-419.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the on-hand inventory is 735 units, which is quite high compared to the average demand (~105 units). The 'In-transit' figure is 997 units, but this includes approximately 813 units from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and now 31, which is 8 periods old). Recent demand has stabilized after the Period 31 spike, with Period 38 showing 79 units. Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P33, P34, P35) were 1-2 periods, though history shows up to 3 is possible. Given the high on-hand inventory (735 units) and the need to burn through this stock to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period), no new orders are desired. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will keep mu_hat relatively low. While the pipeline is technically 'inflated' by lost orders, the current on-hand stock is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to a value below the current on-hand plus pipeline (minus confirmed losses) will result in a zero order, which is the goal.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Period 31 order (224 units) confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost units: ~813 (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31). Supply chain showing high on-hand levels due to bulk arrivals from P33-P35; current stock (735 units) covers ~7 periods of demand.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 989 units and an in-transit pipeline of 664 units. The historical demand remains stable around a mean of ~105 units per period. The on-hand inventory alone (989 units) covers approximately 9-10 periods of demand, which is far beyond our planning horizon (L+1 = 4). The 'in-transit' figure of 664 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31) totaling 813 units, though some newer arrivals have partially cleared the accounting pipeline. Because the current on-hand stock is extremely high relative to demand, we need to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method while L is at the promised 2 periods would result in a base stock much lower than the current inventory + pipeline sum, effectively resulting in a zero order, which is the desired outcome to burn off the excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Inventory levels are now excessive (989 on-hand) due to bulk arrivals from P33-P36. With demand stable at ~105, current stock covers ~9 periods. No new orders are required until on-hand levels drop significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-409.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system is in an overstock position due to large bulk arrivals from orders placed in Periods 33-36. On-hand inventory is currently 873 units, which, at a stable demand rate of approximately 105 units per period (average of recent demand: [115, 128, 97, 79, 79, 116]), covers over 8 periods of demand. This is well above the target base stock level even when accounting for supply chain instability and lost shipments (confirmed lost: P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31, totaling ~813 units). These lost units continue to inflate the 'In-transit' figure (664 units), making it difficult for the OR backend's default logic to trigger new orders. However, since the current on-hand inventory is so high, the priority is to minimize holding costs by avoiding any new procurement. I will set mu_hat and L to levels that ensure no new order is generated, allowing on-hand inventory to deplete naturally. The OR engine will subtract the pipeline inventory (which includes phantom lost units) from the base stock; by setting mu_hat using recent demand (N=5) and lead time to the promised 2 periods, the calculated base stock will be significantly lower than the current inventory + pipeline, resulting in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Current on-hand inventory (873) is excessive, covering ~8 periods of demand. Confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31) permanently inflate the pipeline inventory by ~813 units, though some have aged out of the current in-transit view. Lead times for recent successful deliveries have stabilized between 1-3 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current supply chain status for chips(Regular) is characterized by an inventory surplus. On-hand inventory is currently 754 units, which covers approximately 7-8 periods of demand given the current stable demand mean of ~100-105 units. Significant pipeline inflation exists due to historically lost shipments (estimated at ~813 units from periods P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P31) which remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 664. Since the on-hand inventory is far above any reasonable base-stock level (which would typically be around 400 units for a 3-period lead time), no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the stable demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not place unintended orders by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent historical performance, while the high on-hand balance naturally suppresses ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current on-hand inventory is 640 units, which, at the current average demand of approximately 105 units per period, covers more than 6 periods of demand. This is well above the desired safety stock level, especially considering the stabilized (though variable) lead time of 1-3 periods. The 'in-transit' figure of 664 units is composed almost entirely of historically confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, 31 totaling approximately 813 units, though some have aged out of the engine's tracking window). These 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders if base stock is set too low. However, with the current excessive on-hand stock, no new orders are desired. I will maintain the base stock logic at a level that results in zero new orders by using the 'default' lead time (2) and a 'recent_N' mu_hat (N=12) to capture the stable demand regime (~105/unit). No ordering is expected until on-hand inventory drops closer to the ~400-500 range.

Given the historical average demand of approximately 100-110 units per period, the current on-hand stock alone covers more than 5 periods of demand. The supply chain has a history of significant instability, including confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, 31) totaling approximately 813 units. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' figure indefinitely, inflating the pipeline and preventing the OR backend from placing new orders if mu_hat is set too low. However, because current on-hand inventory is so high (557 units), no new orders are desired. We set parameters to reflect the stable demand regime (approx. 104 units/period) and the 3-period planning lead time identified in past periods, while ensuring the base stock level remains below the current inventory to prevent unnecessary ordering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 451 units. With a mean demand of approximately 105 units per period (recent average), this stock covers roughly 4.3 periods. The 'in-transit' figure of 664 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31), totaling 813 phantom units that never arrived. Although the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock, current on-hand inventory is still sufficient to meet demand for the next few periods while lead times stabilize. Recent successful arrivals (P33-P36) showed lead times of 1-3 periods. I will continue to hold ordering until on-hand inventory drops closer to a safety level (approx. 3 periods of demand). By setting mu_hat to 0, I ensure the OR backend does not place an order this period, avoiding further accumulation of holding costs while we burn through existing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, on-hand inventory has decreased to 348 units. With a stable demand average of approximately 105 units per period (last 5 periods: 119, 114, 83, 106, 103), current stock covers approximately 3.3 periods of demand. Given the supply chain's history of instability\u2014specifically the 22% order loss rate and actual lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods\u2014we must plan for a 3-period lead time (L=2 promised + 1 review period). In-transit inventory remains high at 664 units, but a significant portion of this is likely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31) totaling 813 units, which permanently inflate the pipeline count in the OR engine's logic. To prevent the OR engine from skipping necessary orders due to this 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1100. This target level accounts for (L+1) periods of demand (~420 units) plus a buffer to offset the portion of lost units still tracked in the pipeline. Since current on-hand (348) plus 'effective' in-transit is likely nearing the reorder point, this explicit setting ensures a small replenishment order is triggered if needed, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory has decreased to 243 units, which covers approximately 2.3 periods of demand (mean demand ~106). The 'in-transit' total is 789 units, but historical carry-over insights and manual calculation confirm that approximately 662-664 of these units are 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and 31). This leaves only the Period 46 order (125 units) as a valid incoming shipment. To maintain a safety stock that accounts for the unstable lead time (1-3 periods) and the ~20% shipment loss rate, the base-stock target must be significantly higher than the phantom pipeline. Current 'real' pipeline is 125 units. I set mu_hat explicitly to 1100 (approximately 10 periods of demand) to ensure the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order quantity, effectively bypassing the 'in-transit' inflation. This approach compensates for the 664 units of lost inventory while targeting enough stock to prevent the stockouts observed in earlier phases of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $367.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the inventory situation is stabilizing but requires careful management as the game nears its end (Period 50). On-hand inventory is 121 units, which is almost exactly one period of average demand (~105 units). In-transit inventory is 883 units; however, a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31 total approx. 813 units). Real in-transit units include orders from P46 (125 units) and P47 (94 units). Given the lead time variability (1-3 periods), the P46 order is expected to arrive in Period 48 or 49. To ensure availability for the final periods while avoiding excessive holding costs at the game's conclusion, I will set mu_hat based on the stable demand mean (approx. 105) over a 4-period horizon (L=3 + 1). To bypass the OR engine's pipeline check which includes the 813 lost units, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the total in-transit (883) plus desired stock. Calculating: (4 periods * 105) + 813 lost units = 1233. This ensures the engine places an order to cover the final periods despite the inflated pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory has dropped to 15 units, while demand remains stable at approximately 105 units per period. The supply chain continues to be severely impacted by 'phantom inventory'\u2014confirmed lost shipments from Periods 4, 10, 11, 13, 20, and 31 totaling approximately 813 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 1139), which prevents the OR engine from ordering unless the base stock (mu_hat) is set high enough to exceed the sum of on-hand inventory and the inflated pipeline. To maintain a service level that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 promised + 1 review period), we need approximately 315-400 units of 'real' inventory. Given the 813 lost units and 15 on-hand, we must set mu_hat significantly higher than the current in-transit level to trigger an order. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1350 to ensure the backend places an order that compensates for the lost units and replenishes the current low stock. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (approx. sqrt(3) * 23) to account for demand volatility and lead-time instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a pipeline heavily inflated by lost shipments. History confirms orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, and P31 (~813 units) are lost but remain in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation. The current 'In-transit' of 1275 units includes these lost units plus orders from P46, P48, and P49. P46 (125 units) is now at L=3 and should have arrived; its absence suggests it might also be delayed or lost. Demand is stable around 110 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 1275 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set explicitly higher than the total pipeline + expected demand. I am setting mu_hat to 1500 to clear the pipeline hurdle and ensure a new order is generated to recover from the current stockout, assuming a planning horizon (L+1) of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Order from Period 46 (125 units) has not arrived after 3 periods, suggesting continued supply instability or potential loss. Phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P31) continues to require explicit mu_hat adjustments to bypass OR engine logic.
