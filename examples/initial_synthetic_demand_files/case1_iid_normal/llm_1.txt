I need to cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 to avoid stockouts until the first order arrives. (e) Target inventory level calculation: Average demand (111.4) * (Lead time 2 + 1) = 334.2 units. Adding a small safety stock for the high historical variance (max sample 138 vs avg 111), I will target approximately 360 units to ensure high service level given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1).

Average observed is 100.3. The P2 drop (74) seems like variance rather than a regime shift. I will forecast ~110 units/period. c) Lead Time: Promised L=2. Order placed P1 (360 units) should arrive during P3 and be visible in P4 START. However, the game history for P3 conclude shows arrived=0. Per 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order should have arrived during P3 and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' read at the start of P4. Since it shows 0, the P1 order is likely delayed or lost. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 585 (P1: 360, P2: 115, P3: 110). e) Order Logic: We are experiencing stockouts (sold=0). Assuming the P1 order (360) eventually arrives, it covers ~3.2 periods of demand. However, with L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (P4, P5, P6). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~330. Total pipeline (0 on-hand + 585 in-transit) = 585.

The primary challenge is the supply chain, which has a historical loss rate of ~50% and a lead time of 1-3 periods for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 161 units. The total in-transit is 1920, but most of this is comprised of very old, lost orders. Functional pipeline assessment (orders from last 4 periods): P39 (80), P40 (80), P41 (100), P42 (80). Assuming a 50% success rate, we expect ~170 of these units to arrive eventually. With on-hand (161) and adjusted pipeline (~170), we have ~331 units to cover the remaining 8 periods. Average demand of 110/period means we need ~880 units for the rest of the game. Subtracting our 'good' inventory/pipeline (331) leaves a deficit of ~549 units. Given the 50% loss rate, I must order approximately double the deficit (1100 units) spread over the remaining periods to ensure consistent stock without excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Supply chain reliability remains poor with a ~50% loss rate; functional pipeline should only include orders placed within the last 4 periods. Successful lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods. Demand remains steady at approximately 110 units/period.",

Orders placed in P41 (100 units) and P42 (80 units) are within the 1-3 period arrival window. The order from P39 (80 units) is now 4 periods old and potentially lost, consistent with the 50% loss pattern. Current on-hand inventory is 158 units. Expected demand for P44 is ~105 units. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50), we must ensure enough stock to cover the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50), which is ~735 units. Given the ~50% arrival rate, the pipeline needs to be significantly over-ordered. Total desired inventory for remaining periods (735) minus current on-hand (158) = 577 units needed. Adjusting for 50% reliability, we need roughly 1150 units in the pipeline. Current reliable pipeline (P41, P42, P43) is 100+80+150 = 330 units.

Given the history, lead times (L) have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a significant loss rate (~50%). Orders from P46, P47, and P48 are currently in-transit. A P49 order would only arrive in Period 50 if the lead time is 1 period (which happened in P38, P36, P35, P30, P29, P26, P20, P19). Demand is stable around 100-110 units. On-hand inventory is 94. Expected demand for P49 is ~105. Since Period 50 is the final period, we only need enough inventory to cover P49 and P50 demand (approx 210 total). With 94 on hand, and P46 (250 units, 3 periods ago) likely to arrive in P49 or P50, and P47/P48 in the pipeline, we have a high chance of meeting the final period's demand. However, to maximize the final reward and hedge against the 50% loss rate, a small buffer order that could arrive in 1 period is prudent, though we must avoid excessive holding costs for the final period. Since any order placed now that doesn't arrive by Period 50 is wasted and any that arrives but isn't sold incurs a holding cost, and we already have 2740 units in transit (most of which are old/lost), I will place a zero order to avoid further accumulation of likely-to-be-lost or excess inventory in the final step, relying on the current pipeline and on-hand stock.",
