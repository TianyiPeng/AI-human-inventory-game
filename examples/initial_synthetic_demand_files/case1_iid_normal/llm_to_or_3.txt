Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance data beyond the initial five demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The mean demand is 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrival history yet, I will use the default method for the lead time parameter. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to seed the OR backend with the most relevant starting statistics for this initial phase. This approach ensures that the base stock calculation, which accounts for (L+1) periods of demand, effectively covers the gap until the first replenishment arrives.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As expected for L=4, no units arrived in Period 1 (arrivals happen DURING the period and are reported in the next period's conclusion). Since starting inventory was 0, we had 0 sales and 108 units of lost demand. Past demand samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) plus the Period 1 demand (108) show a stable pattern with a mean around 111 units. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available history for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the promised lead time of 4. The OR engine will aim to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, minus the current in-transit inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game periods was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111.4). In Period 1 and 2, demand was 108 and 74 respectively. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 278 units in transit (141 from P1, 137 from P2). The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the game mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 will arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Thus, the 0 arrivals in Period 1 and 2 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. Since the recent demand (74) is lower than the historical average, but only one data point is significant, I will use a slightly more recent window for demand estimation (N=5, including the 2 game periods and 3 pre-game periods) to stay responsive without overreacting to the single low 74 value. I'll maintain the default lead time of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The initial on-hand inventory was 0, and we have had stockouts for the first 3 periods because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Our orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 (141, 137, 146 units respectively) are all in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclusion (usable in Period 6). Demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] from pre-game and [108, 74, 119] during the game. The mean demand remains stable around 107-110 units per period. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to default (4). mu_hat is set to default to use the full history available, which provides a stable mean estimate. sigma_hat is also set to default to capture historical volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (ready for Period 6 decision). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 563 units in transit (ordered across Periods 1-4). Demand history shows [108, 74, 119, 124] for a mean of 106.25 and a standard deviation of 22.5. I am sticking to the promised lead time of 4 and using recent history (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which effectively covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This accounts for the pipeline until the first order arrives.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Recent demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51] during the first 5 periods. The most recent demand (51) is significantly lower than average (avg ~104), but with only one data point, it's too early to confirm a regime shift. I will use the last 5 demand samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which includes the lower value but maintains stability. mu_hat is calculated for (1+L) = 5 periods. On-hand is 90, with 433 in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant shift. The first 4 periods had a mean demand of 106.25 (108, 74, 119, 124). However, the last 2 periods (P5 and P6) show a sharp decline to a mean of 59 (51, 67). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of orders from Period 1 and Period 2 exactly in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 160, and we have 309 units in transit (expected arrivals in P7, P8, and P9). Given the recent demand drop, we need to adjust our parameters to avoid excessive holding costs. Although the regime is short (2 samples in the 'conclude' history), the drop is roughly 44%, which is significant for a regular chip product. I will use recent_N=3 for demand to capture this downward trend while still acknowledging the older data slightly, and set L to 'default' as it matches history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand dropped from ~106 to ~59 starting Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand analysis shows a clear shift. Periods 1-4 demand values were [108, 74, 119, 124] (mean: 106.25), while Periods 5-7 were [51, 67, 103] (mean: 73.6). Although Period 7 saw a jump back to 103, the last three periods still represent a lower average than the start. Promised lead time is 4, and confirmed lead times for the first three orders (arriving in P5, P6, P7) were exactly 4 periods. Since L=4, my parameters need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=3 for mu_hat properly captures the recent average and volatility of the lower-demand regime while weighting the recent uptick in Period 7 fairly. On-hand (203) and In-transit (170) provide a healthy pipeline given the current lead time stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of lead times (Periods 5-8 concludes) confirms the actual lead time is exactly the promised 4 periods (L=4). Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 5. The initial mean demand (P1-P4) was 106.25, while the recent mean demand (P5-P8) is 78.25. However, the drop was most pronounced in Period 5 (51) and has since trended back upwards (67, 103, 92). The current carry-over insight noted a shift to ~59, but looking at the last 4 periods, the average is higher. I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime compared to the very beginning, while acknowledging the slight recovery from the Period 5 low. On-hand inventory is high (250) due to previous large orders arriving, while in-transit (77) consists of the smaller orders from P5-P8. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that likely results in a small or zero order this period to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Post-Period 5 average demand is 78.25 (down from initial 106.25). Lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the current on-hand inventory is 161 units with 175 units in-transit. Demand since Period 5 has averaged 82.6 units (51, 67, 103, 92, 100). The most recent demand samples suggest a slight recovery toward the initial mean, but still remain below the pre-Period 5 levels. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given current inventory levels (On-hand 161 + In-transit 175 = 336), and an estimated demand rate around 85-90 units, we are currently well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current market regime since Period 5. This allows the system to adjust to the lower average demand observed in the latter half of the history while remaining responsive to the recent upward trend in samples 7-9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular). The Carry-over Insights indicate a demand regime shift around Period 5. Analyzing the recent history (Periods 5-10), demand has been: 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79. The mean for these last 6 periods is 82.0, which is lower than the initial average but shows a slight upward trend compared to the earlier post-shift estimate. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (as seen in consecutive 'conclude' messages for Orders 1 through 6). Therefore, L will be set to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current demand regime. The current on-hand (95) and in-transit (282) inventory totaling 377 units are being reconciled against the expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon which is approximately 410 units, justifying the moderate ordering levels triggered by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 5-10 mean demand is 82.0 (standard deviation ~19.5). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the inventory status for chips(Regular) is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 11 where demand (122) exceeded starting inventory (102). Pipeline inventory is 347 units. Historical data shows a clear shift in demand regimes. Periods 1-4 had a high mean demand of ~106. Periods 5-11 show a stabilized mean of 87.7 with a standard deviation of ~23.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-11). With the stockout in Period 11 and a lead time of 4, the target inventory must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using N=7 (the length of the current regime from Period 5 to 11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will accurately reflect the new demand distribution while ignoring the outdated high-demand period at the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 5-11 mean demand is 87.7 (std dev ~23.5). Stockout occurred in Period 11 due to low arrivals from previous small orders (Periods 5-7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we experienced a second consecutive stockout because arrivals (46 units from Period 8) were insufficient to cover demand (119 units). The current on-hand inventory is 0. However, the pipeline is full with 429 units in transit. Specifically, the order from Period 9 (109 units) is expected to arrive during Period 13 resolution, and the order from Period 10 (120 units) in Period 14. Demand since Period 5 has shown a shift; while initially lower, it has recovered to an average of ~91.5 over the last 8 periods (P5-P12). Given the recent stockouts and the higher demand observed in P11 (122) and P12 (119), I will use the last 8 periods (N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current demand regime which is higher than the immediate post-drop period but lower than the initial start. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-12 has stabilized at a mean of ~91.5 with significant variance; recent stockouts in P11-P12 were due to low-volume orders placed during the P5-P7 dip now entering the arrival phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is recovering from stockouts in Periods 11 and 12. These stockouts were caused by low-volume orders placed during a perceived demand dip between Periods 5-7 which have now fully arrived. Historical demand data shows two distinct phases: Phase 1 (P1-P4) with mean 106.25, and Phase 2 (P5-P13) with mean 92.5. Recent demand (P11-P13) has been consistently higher at 122, 119, and 102. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. With only 7 units on-hand and 396 in-transit, we must set parameters that reflect the current stabilized demand regime (P5-P13, N=9) while ensuring sufficient stock for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Using N=9 for mu_hat captures the post-dip recovery better than the full history, while mu_hat will be calculated as (1+4)*mean(P5-P13) which is roughly 462.5.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-13 has stabilized at a mean of ~92.5; recent 3-period demand (P11-P13) is higher (avg 114.3) compared to the P5-P7 dip (avg 73.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a volatile dip between Periods 5-7. Recent demand (Periods 11-14) shows values of 122, 119, 102, and 128, averaging 117.75 units. This is significantly higher than the average of 92.5 recorded up to Period 13. The system is currently in a stockout state (ending inventory 0 in Period 14) because orders placed during the low-demand regime (Periods 5-7) were too small and are only now arriving. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stockout and meet the current higher demand level, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this upward shift (avg ~118), which across (L+1=5) periods results in a target stock level of approximately 590. With 381 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size to bridge this gap, adjusted by the system cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed: Periods 11-14 average demand is 117.75 (+27% compared to Periods 5-13 average of 92.5). Stockouts in P11, P12, and P14 highlight the need to focus on recent higher demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again. The most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) show an average demand of 116.6, significantly higher than the P5-P10 average of 82.0. We have experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods (P11, P12, P14, P15) because the arrivals (from low orders placed in P7-P11) are insufficient to meet this higher demand. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters based on the most recent high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend increases order sizes. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this current surge (approx 117 units/period). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Periods 11-15 average demand is 116.6, representing a ~42% increase over the P5-P10 average (82.0). Recurrent stockouts (4/5 last periods) necessitate using recent_N=5 for demand forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after a period of volatility and stockouts. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged approximately 110.3 units (122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79), significantly higher than the previous low regime (P5-P10 avg: 82.0). Period 16 saw a dip to 79, but given the 4 stockouts between P11 and P15, it is safer to maintain a forecast based on this recent higher-demand window. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on all concluded arrivals from P5-P16. I will use recent_N=6 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime while incorporating the recent dip to avoid over-ordering, while keeping L at default (4) to reflect the stable lead time. With 49 units on-hand and 452 in-transit, we must ensure the pipeline covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the Period 5-10 dip. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P11-P17), demand values are [122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109], yielding an average of approximately 110.1 units per period. This shift is significant compared to the previous regime (average ~82). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P13 order arrived in P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (16 units), but there is a substantial pipeline (461 units). To sustain the service level given previous stockouts and the higher demand regime, I will continue using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Periods 11-17 average demand is 110.1, a significant increase from the P5-P10 average of 82.0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a higher level than the Period 5-10 dip. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P11-P18), the average demand is 105.8, which is consistent with the 'CARRY-OVER INSIGHT' of a sustained surge around 110 units. Recent demand has fluctuated (122, 119, 102, 128, 112, 79, 109, 76), showing a mix of highs and moderate values. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while weighting it against recent volatility to avoid stockouts, which were frequent between P11 and P15. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (L=4). The current on-hand inventory (45) plus in-transit (461) is substantial, but since L=4, we must ensure the pipeline covers demand for the next 5 periods. Using recent_N=8 provides a robust mean (105.8) and standard deviation for the backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P11-P18): Mean demand is 105.8, significantly higher than the P5-P10 dip. This represents the current 'normal' operating state.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a recovery from the Period 5-10 dip. Analyzing demand from Period 11 to Period 19, the mean demand is approximately 107.6, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand phase. Lead times have remained consistently at the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 384 units, which is quite high. Given the recent history of stockouts followed by stabilization, I will use recent_N=9 (capturing the Period 11-19 regime) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the current sustained demand level while accounting for the recent variability. This strategy aims to maintain a sufficient service level without over-ordering, considering the large volume of units currently in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P11-P19): Mean demand is ~107.6, consistent with the identified 'new normal' operating state after the mid-cycle dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a recovery from the Period 5-10 dip. Analyzing the 'new normal' demand (Periods 11-20), the mean demand is 106.8 units per period [ (122+119+102+128+112+79+109+76+122+99)/10 ]. This is consistently higher than the previous trough and aligns with the carry-over insights identifying a stabilized state around ~107 units. All documented lead times have remained perfectly stable at 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' inventory (380 units) represents the orders placed in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 (85+105+60+130=380), which are scheduled to arrive in Periods 21, 22, 23, and 24 respectively. With 95 units on hand and 380 in transit, the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the most recent stabilized regime (the 'new normal') while smoothing out the volatility observed between 76 and 128 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a 'new normal' regime following a dip between periods 5-10. Since Period 11, the demand has averaged approximately 106.5 units per period. The most recent demand was 95, which aligns with this stabilized range. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. I will use the recent_N method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=11 (covering the current stable regime from Period 11 to 21) to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained pattern accurately. This balances the risk of stockouts (which were frequent between Periods 11-15) against holding costs. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 388) and on-hand (85) are currently healthy to meet upcoming lead-time demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the recovery from the mid-cycle dip (Period 5-10). The current demand regime (Periods 11-22) shows a mean demand of approximately 104.2 units per period. The most recent demand (P22) was 83, which is slightly below the current regime average but within normal variance. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. With on-hand inventory at 107 and in-transit inventory at 372 (total pipeline: 479), the system is well-positioned to meet demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use N=12 for demand and volatility to capture the full 'new normal' regime since Period 11, ensuring the OR backend balances the service level against the $1 holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable for the last 13 periods (since Period 11) with a mean demand of approximately 105.7. The most recent demand (Period 23) was 131, which is on the higher side of the current regime's variance but within expected bounds. On-hand inventory is currently at 36, having just fulfilled a high demand of 131. In-transit inventory stands at 386 units, which includes orders from Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23. This pipeline (386 units) plus current on-hand (36 units) totals 422 units, which covers approximately 4.2 periods of current average demand (L=4). Lead time has remained consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals. To maintain a high service level while managing for the current 'new normal' demand regime (avoiding both the P5-P10 dip and the very early data), I will use the last 13 periods (N=13) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the sustained higher demand seen since Period 11 without overreacting to single-period volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable in a 'new normal' state since Period 11. Analysis of demand from Period 11 to Period 24 shows a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units per period. The recent demand (P21-P24) remains consistent with this, showing an average of 101.25. While there were stockouts earlier due to a previous supply-demand mismatch, the inventory levels have now stabilized with fairly consistent arrivals matching the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the current regime has been stable for 14 periods, I will use recent_N=14 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this 'new normal' state, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the (L+1) period cycle (P25 decision plus 4 periods of lead time).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized (P11-P24): Mean demand is approx 101.5 per period, confirming the 'new normal' level after the mid-cycle dip. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'new normal' regime identified since Period 11. Over the last 15 periods (P11-P25), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) show an average demand of 98.8 units (95, 83, 131, 96, 89), which is consistent with the established regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all concluded orders. The current pipeline inventory (398 units) plus on-hand inventory (74 units) equals 472 units, which covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure the base stock covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the stable 'new normal' regime while smoothing out the variability observed in recent periods (e.g., the spike to 131 in P23).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'new normal' regime established after Period 11. Over the last 15 periods (P11-P26), the mean demand is approximately 102.3 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show a similar average demand of 98.0 units. Current inventory status is healthy with 72 units on-hand and 392 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the stability of the current regime and the lack of upcoming known seasonal events in the description, I will use a recent_N approach of 15 periods to capture the stabilized mean and variance of this 'new normal' state. This balancing act ensures we maintain a high service level (requested by the backend profit/holding cost ratio) while not over-ordering based on short-term fluctuations.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and consistent lead times of 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' inventory (398 units) plus 'On-hand' (33 units) equals 431 units, which covers approximately 4.25 periods of mean demand. Since lead time is 4, we need to maintain coverage for L+1 (5) periods. I will continue using the settled regime's statistics (recent_N=17, covering P11 to P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the need to maintain service levels while preventing overstocking as we enter the latter half of the cycle. Lead time remains 'default' (4) as no deviations have been observed.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'new normal' regime established after Period 11. Over the last 18 periods (P11-P28), the mean demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of 17.0. Recent performance (P24-P28) shows a mean of 100.2, which is consistent with the long-term stable average. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 61, with a healthy pipeline of 382 units. I will use the last 18 samples (N=18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire stable regime post-dip while filtering out the volatile early periods and the Period 5-10 trough. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand environment (approx. 104 units/period) while accounting for moderate volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'new normal' regime identified since Period 11. Over the last 15 periods (P15-P29), the mean demand is approximately 102.6 units per period. In the very recent window (last 5 periods), the mean is 102.4. This level of stability suggests we should continue using a recent_N window that captures this steady state while ignoring the initial volatility and the significant dip between periods 5-10. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory (394) plus on-hand (49) is sufficient to cover roughly 4-5 periods of demand, and the OR engine will manage the specific order quantity based on these parameters. I will use N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a robust estimate of the current regime's mean and variance.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable for the last 20 periods (P11-P30), with a mean of approximately 104.7 and a standard deviation of 17.1. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly higher at 108.8, but still within the established range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 21 and a healthy pipeline of 403, I am using a recent_N approach (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'new normal' demand profile established since Period 11, which balances the need for stability with sensitivity to the current demand level. The L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, a significant demand spike occurred (154 units), resulting in a stockout. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 119.4, which is notably higher than the long-term average (P11-P31) of approximately 104. This spike suggests a potential shift toward higher volatility or a new demand peak. To prevent further stockouts and ensure the base stock levels adapt to this recent upward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand surge detected (P27-P31): Mean demand increased to 119.4 (+15% vs P11-P26 average of 103.8), leading to a stockout in Period 31.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new higher-demand regime starting around Period 27. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P27-P32) is approximately 112.8, with a significant spike of 154 in Period 31 that caused a stockout. The previous 'new normal' (P11-P26) was around 101.5. To respond to this recent surge and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 32 conclusion showing the P28 order arriving on time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand surge starting Period 27: mean demand increased from ~102 to ~113. Period 31 saw a peak demand of 154.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new higher regime starting around Period 27. While early data (P5-P26) showed an average of ~102, the most recent 7 periods (P27-P33) have an average demand of 110.6, including a significant peak of 154 in P31 which led to a stockout. The Period 32 demand was 90 and Period 33 was 87, but the broader trend suggests a higher mean is necessary to prevent future stockouts during peaks. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and higher mean while discounting the older low-demand periods. This settings will cause the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) = 5 period risk window, ensuring the pipeline can support the current ~110 units/period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after a surge noted between P27 and P31. Following the peak of 154 in P31, the demand has dropped to 90, 87, and 80 in the most recent three periods. This suggests that the 'surge' was likely a temporary spike rather than a permanent regime shift to a much higher mean. The current average demand over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is 103.0, which is very close to the established 'new normal' of approximately 101.5 reported in P25. However, the recent 3-period decline (average 85.7) suggests a return towards the lower end of the variance. Given the recent stockout in P31 and the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the surge and recovery periods together, providing a balanced forecast of 103.0 units per period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The high in-transit inventory (449) relative to current demand implies that the OR backend will naturally reduce order quantities to prevent excessive holding costs as the system realizes demand has cooled.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge from P27-P31 (mean 119.4) has subsided; demand in P32-P34 averaged 85.7, indicating a return to the post-P11 baseline of ~102.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge observed between Periods 27-31 (mean ~119.4, peak 154) appears to have stabilized. Recent demand in Periods 32-35 (90, 87, 80, 115) averages 93, which is closer to the long-term 'new normal' established after Period 11 (approx 102). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering Period 27 to now) balances the recent volatility with the established baseline, preventing over-correction from the Period 31 peak while accounting for the recent stabilize-down phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Current on-hand (82) plus pipeline (380) is 462, which is roughly 4.6 periods of demand at the 100-unit-per-period rate. Using recent_N for mu and sigma allows the OR backend to adjust parameters based on the most relevant recent performance regime (post-surge normalization).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge (P27-P31) has normalized; average demand from P32-P35 is 93.0, returning closer to the post-P11 average of ~102.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the demand for chips(Regular) appears to be stabilizing at a higher level than the previous dip but reflecting recent volatility. Demand in the last 10 periods (P27-P36) averaged 106.7, vs. the last 5 periods (P32-P36) at 100.0. Period 36 specifically saw 128 units of demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 106 with 346 units in-transit. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the 'new normal' demand level which includes the recent surge and subsequent minor cooling, providing a robust base while accounting for the recent stockouts (P31). L is set to default (4) as actual lead times are stable. sigma_hat uses recent_N=20 to capture sufficient variance to calculate appropriate safety stock.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge observed between Period 27 and 31 (peaking at 154) has normalized over the last 6 periods. Examining the demand from Period 32 to 37 [90, 87, 80, 115, 128, 97], the average is 99.5, which aligns with the long-term 'new normal' identified since Period 11 (approximately 101-103). Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this stabilization post-surge while remaining responsive to slightly higher recent variance. Pipeline inventory (383) and on-hand (106) provides a healthy coverage against the expected lead-time demand, but maintained orders are necessary to avoid future stockouts as the surge-period arrivals finish.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability following a surge in Periods 27-31. Over the last seven periods (P32-P38), demand has averaged 97.0, which is slightly lower than the 'new normal' average of 102 units established earlier. Specifically, the last three periods have shown demands of 128, 97, and 79 (avg 101.3). The current on-hand inventory is 96, with a significant pipeline of 358 units. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. Given the recent variability but overall return to the baseline, I will use recent_N=7 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the post-surge behavior without being overly skewed by the P31 peak of 154. This aligns the base stock calculation with the current stabilized state. The OR engine will use these parameters to manage the high pipeline against the moderate on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown historical fluctuations, including a significant dip around Period 5 and a recent surge between Periods 27-31. Following that surge, demand has stabilized. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 101.0, and for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) specifically, it is 99.6. This aligns with the 'new normal' identified in the carry-over insights (~102). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 360 units (covering roughly 3.5 periods of demand) with 79 units on hand. To capture the current stabilized demand level while remaining responsive to the recent volatility seen in the P27-P31 peak, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N-value covers the transition from the peak back to stability, providing a balanced buffer.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability following the surge in Periods 27-31. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), the mean demand is 100.0, which aligns closely with the long-term 'new normal' baseline identified around Period 25. The lead time remains consistent and reliable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 40 arrival. Current on-hand inventory is 81 with a healthy in-transit pipeline of 360 units. I am using a recent_N window of 9 for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This window (P32-P40) captures the stabilization phase after the Period 31 peak, providing a balanced look at recent variability (ranging from 79 to 128) without over-reacting to the older surge. The backend's base-stock calculation will use these to maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability following the surge in Period 31. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is 97.5 units per period. Recent 5-period demand (P37-P41) is slightly higher at 98.0 units, suggesting the 'new normal' established after Period 11 (historically around 102) remains the most relevant long-term benchmark, despite shorter-term fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 96 units on hand and 304 in transit (total 400), and an expected 5-period demand (L+1) coverage requirement of approximately 500 units based on the post-P11 average, additional inventory is needed. I will use recent_N=30 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P11 stabilized regime while smoothing out the P27-P31 surge and the P38-P39 dip. This provides a balanced base stock for the OR engine.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 102.5 units over the last 11 periods (P32-P42) after the surge observed in late Period 20s. Recent data (P39-P42) shows demand consistently above 110 (mean 107 in that micro-window), with the most recent demand being 114. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (26 units) following the arrival of a small order (44 units), but in-transit inventory is high (396 units). To maintain the optimal service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) and account for the recent stabilization at the ~102-105 range, I am using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the behavior after the P27-P31 surge peaked and settled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after several fluctuations. The post-Period 11 'new normal' average demand is approximately 101.5, though more recent demand (P32-P43) has shown higher variability with an average of approximately 100.5. The most recent demand sample in P43 was 83, which is on the lower side. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 7 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 447 units (which is ample for the remaining 6 periods of the game), the goal is to maintain the service level while managing ending inventory as the game approaches conclusion in Period 50. I will use a recent_N of 12 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the demand behavior since the P32 surge, which averages around 100.5, ensuring the system targets a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods (502.5 units). Current pipeline + on-hand (454) is slightly below this, which will trigger a moderate order to buffer towards the end of the simulation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after several minor shifts. Since Period 11 (the 'new normal'), demand has averaged approximately 102 units. Recently (Periods 36-44), demand has averaged approximately 104 units, showing no significant new regime change compared to the long-term stable level. On-hand inventory is low (19), but a large arrival is expected in the coming periods based on orders from P41 (78), P42 (136), and P43 (115), totaling a healthy pipeline of 404 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the older mid-cycle dip (P5-P10). This choice balances the need for stability with sensitivity to the current volume.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 102 units in the long term, but more recent periods (P40-P45) show a slightly higher mean of approximately 105.2. Period 45 ended with a stockout (ending on-hand 0) because the arrival from P41 (78 units) was insufficient to cover the demand of 103 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), I need to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining duration. Current in-transit inventory is 457 units (representing orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the current 'normal' demand level (avg ~104) while accounting for recent variability. I will use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat as well to provide a localized volatility estimate for the safety stock calculation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units per period since the post-dip recovery. Recent demand in Periods 40-46 shows a mean of 106.6 (116, 119, 114, 83, 106, 103, 105), which is consistent with the 'new normal' identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), we are within the lead time window for the final orders. Current on-hand inventory (31) and pipeline inventory (409) must cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1). Given recent history, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 15 periods (since Period 32 post-surge normalization) will capture the current volatility and mean effectively. This balances the risk of stockouts seen in Period 45 with the holding costs of the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable following the normalization period after Period 36. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), mean demand is approximately 102.6, which aligns with the long-term 'new normal' identified since Period 11. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P43-P47) is slightly higher at 103.8. There are no significant calendar events or cultural drivers identified for 'Period 48' to suggest a deviation from this mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the entire history. The current pipeline inventory (386 units) plus on-hand (24 units) is 410, which is roughly 4 periods of demand at the 102.6 avg. To ensure we cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand and maintain a buffer given the recent stockout in P45, I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at the penultimate period of the game (Period 50 is the final). The current inventory state is 0 on-hand with 441 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent history (P44 order arrived P48). Demand has been relatively stable around the 'new normal' established since P11. Looking at the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is (79+116+119+114+83+106+103+105+122+106)/10 = 105.3. The standard deviation over this period is approximately 14.5. Given we are at P49, orders placed now will arrive at the start of Period 53 (49+4), which is beyond the game end date (Period 50). However, the OR backend logic requires valid parameters to maintain the policy even if the arrival date exceeds the horizon. We will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current stable demand regime and 'default' for L as the promised 4-period lead time remains accurate.

Daily Profit: $468.00, Daily Holding Cost: $14.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $454.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at its established 'new normal' level, with the most recent sample (Period 49) at 117. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is 111.0 with a standard deviation of approximately 10.9, following the stabilization after earlier surges. The inventory position consists of 14 units on-hand and 423 units in-transit (orders from P46-P49). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the history. Given the consistent demand pattern and stable lead times, I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while ignoring historical regime shifts. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) at a 0.8 service level (calculated as Profit/(Profit+Holding) = 4/(4+1)).
