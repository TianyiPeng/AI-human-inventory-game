Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.2. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, and the OR engine uses a base-stock policy (Base Stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the demand over the lookahead window (1+L = 3 periods). Using the 'default' method for mu_hat will compute (1+2)*111.4 = 334.2, and 'default' for sigma_hat will compute sqrt(3)*17.2 = 29.8. This provides a balanced starting point to cover demand until the first order arrives in Period 3.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 108 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0, we had 108 units of lost sales. The order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108] shows a mean of approximately 110.8. I will use the promised lead time of 2 and apply the default statistical methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand appears relatively stable and no lead-time deviations have been observed yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [108, 74] (Periods 1-2). Current on-hand is 0, with 278 units in-transit (141 from P1, 137 from P2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the timing rules, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message (read at P4). Thus, the current lack of inventory is expected. The average demand over the last 7 observations is approximately 105.5 units. There is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or demand regime shifts, though P2 demand (74) was slightly lower than the average. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (all available data) to capture the slightly higher variance while remaining responsive to the promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 'conclude' message, which we read now at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or a lead time longer than promised. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the demand during the active periods was [108, 74, 119]. The average demand is approximately 107 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 346 units are in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Since we have not yet seen any arrivals, we cannot definitively calculate a new lead time, but we must account for the current stockout (0 units sold in P1-P3). I will maintain the L at default (2) for the OR backend but use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while waiting for shipments to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the 'Period 4 conclude' message. Two orders arrived: Period 1 (lead_time=3) and Period 2 (lead_time=2). This confirms the promised lead time of 2 is the baseline, but delays can occur. Currently, we have 154 units on-hand and 78 units in-transit (from Period 3 and 4 orders). Historical demand over the last 5 periods [108, 74, 119, 124, 94] (including the pre-game sample provided) shows a mean of approximately 104. Given the lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for L+1=3 periods. The average lead time observed so far is 2.5 periods. I will set L to 2.5 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent stable demand of ~104 per period, which the backend will multiply by (1+L). Sigma_hat will use the default method to maintain a safe buffer against demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility, with a recent dip in Period 5 (demand=51). The historical average over the last 5 periods is approximately 95.2 units. Looking at the lead time history: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3), while the Period 2 order arrived in the same period (lead_time=2). The Period 3 order (68 units) has not yet arrived as of the Period 5 conclude message; if it follows the lead time of 3 seen in Period 1, it should arrive during Period 6. The current pipeline (213 units) consists of orders from Periods 3, 4, and 5. Given that one out of two completed deliveries experienced a lead time of 3 instead of the promised 2, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval (L+1=4 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, including the recent low demand period which might indicate a temporary drop or just natural variance in 'Regular' chips consumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show lead times of 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in P4) and 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in P4), followed by another 3-period lead time (Period 3 order arrived in P6). This suggests an average lead time of 2.67. I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. Regarding demand, recent history (P5: 51, P6: 67) shows a drop compared to early periods (P1: 108, P2: 74, P3: 119, P4: 124). The mean of all 6 samples is 90.5. However, the last 2 periods suggest a potential downward shift. Since the carry-over instruction requires 3+ periods of consistent evidence for a regime shift, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent moderate-to-low demand trend while smoothing out the volatility. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on N=5 to balance the high early demand with the recent lows.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 7 periods is [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103], plus the provided pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. The average demand is approximately 100 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are [3, 2, 3, 2], averaging 2.5 periods. In-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 4 (10 units), Period 6 (118 units), and Period 7 (36 units), totaling 164. On-hand is 136. Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 300. Since we need to cover (L+1) periods, and L is roughly 2-3, we need to cover ~3-4 periods of demand (~300-400 units). The current pipeline of 300 is slightly low given the lead time volatility. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the drift to 2.5, and 'recent_N' for demand (N=12, covering all available data) to capture the stable mean of ~100 while allowing the backend to factor in the observed variance.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P1:3, P2:2, P3:3, P5:2, P6:2). The most recent arrivals (P5 and P6 orders) adhered to the promised lead time of 2. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is [124, 51, 67, 103, 92], with a mean of 87.4. Including pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the overall mean is approximately 99.4. No strong seasonal signal or regime shift is currently evident, though demand has softened slightly compared to the initial pre-game samples. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P7 (36 units) and P8 (129 units), totaling 165 units (matches the 'In-transit' figure of 175 if including the P4 order of 10 which hasn't arrived/concluded yet - actually P4 order of 10 is missing and might be lost or delayed). I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed drift and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu and sigma to capture the current demand level while smoothing out the recent lower-demand periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Analyzing historical lead times: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P2 in P4 (L=2), P3 in P6 (L=3), P5 in P7 (L=2), and P6 in P8 (L=2). The average actual lead time is 2.4. Current in-transit inventory is 244 (orders from P7, P8, P9). Since P4, demand has fluctuated but shows no clear new regime, with recent demands being 51, 67, 103, 92, and 100. The mean of all historical samples (including the 5 pre-game samples) is approximately 100.2. To account for the observed volatility and slightly extended lead times, I will set L to 2.4 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the necessary window. mu_hat will use the last 10 samples (including pre-game) to capture the current mean demand of ~100. sigma_hat will use the last 10 samples to capture recent variance.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory shows 148 units on-hand and 126 in-transit. An analysis of the in-transit inventory reveals that the 10-unit order from Period 4 is significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering) and is likely lost. The remaining in-transit units are from Period 9 (69 units) and Period 10 (47 units). Historical lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods (Observed: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2), averaging approximately 2.43. I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a buffer against the lost shipment from P4. Demand has been volatile but shows a slight downward trend, with the last 5 periods averaging 88.2 units compared to the initial 111.4. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. The target service level (q) is 0.80, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time fluctuates between 2 and 3 periods (Avg: 2.43); Order from Period 4 (10 units) appears lost.

In Period 12, we observe that on-hand inventory has dropped to 26 units after a demand of 122 in Period 11. The demand history (including the 5 initial samples and 11 game periods) shows a mean of approximately 101.5. No major seasonal shift is detected. Regarding lead time, we have observed values of [3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2], averaging 2.43 periods. The order from Period 4 (10 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost. Currently, 231 units are in transit (from Periods 9, 10, and 11). Given the fluctuations between 2 and 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to be conservative and ensure the base stock covers the extended arrival window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime since the game started, and 'default' for sigma_hat as the volatility remains relatively stable.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 12 (demand 119 vs 95 on-hand). The 'Period 4' order of 10 units remains unreceived after 9 periods and is confirmed lost. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 is still in transit after 3). Based on the history, observed lead times are: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3. The average is 2.5 periods. To prevent further stockouts given the volatility, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to cover the upper bound of the observed lead time. Demand (mu_hat) is stable with no clear regime shift; the mean of all 17 samples (5 past + 12 recent) is 100.4. Using N=17 (all available) for mu_hat. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=17) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Period 4 order (10 units) is lost. Actual lead time is bi-modal (2 or 3 periods), averaging 2.5.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) as demand for Period 13 was completely unmet. This is due to a combination of high demand and lead time variability. Historical demand data (past demands: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and observed demands: [108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119, 102]) suggests a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. The lead time is confirmed to be bi-modal, alternating between 2 and 3 periods (Average ~2.5). The Period 4 order of 10 units is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 434 units in-transit (Orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). For Period 14, I expect the order from Period 11 (105 units) to arrive if L=3 or Period 12 (133 units) if L=2. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the bi-modal lead time and the recent lost shipment, I am using an explicit lead time of 2.5 periods to reflect the true average. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand regime (~100/period) applied across (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I'm using the default to allow the OR backend to calculate standard deviation across the full history to provide a sufficient safety buffer (z-score) given the high stockout risk.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is relatively stable with a mean around 104 units over the last 10 periods. In Period 14, an order of 133 units arrived (ordered in P12), but the order from P11 (105 units) is still missing. Based on history, lead times are either 2 or 3 periods. P11's order is currently at L=3 (P14 conclude), meaning it should arrive in P15. If it does not, it may be lost like the P4 order. Currently, on-hand is very low (5 units), and there is a large in-transit pipeline (301 units, which includes P11, P13, and P14 orders). To prevent over-ordering while accounting for the bi-modal lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the longer potential delay. mu_hat will use the recent 10-period average (approx 103.3) to reflect current demand. sigma_hat will use recent_N to capture current volatility. This approach balances the risk of stockouts due to the L=3 possibility against the holding cost of the incoming 301 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits an actual lead time fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (average 2.44). Crucially, multiple shipments appear lost. The Period 4 order (10 units) was previously confirmed lost. Based on the current Period 16 start, orders from Period 10 (47 units) and Period 11 (105 units) are now 5-6 periods old and have not arrived, suggesting they are also lost. This significantly reduces the 'effective' pipeline from the reported 422 units to approximately 260 units (P13 and P15 orders). Demand remains stable with a recent 5-period average of 116.6, compared to the overall average of ~104.5. To protect against stockouts caused by high variance and lost shipments, I will set L to an explicit 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) to increase the target base stock. mu_hat will use the recent 5-period mean (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand, and sigma_hat will use default (all history) to ensure sufficient safety stock given the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 10 (47 units) and Period 11 (105 units) are highly likely lost (over 5 periods elapsed with no arrival). Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the system-reported 'In-transit' value.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for several periods. The in-transit pipeline is reported as 504 units, but significant portions are likely lost. Specifically, orders from P10 (47 units) and P11 (105 units) are now 6-7 periods old (promised lead time 2, observed max 3), and the order from P4 (10 units) was previously confirmed lost. This total of 162 units should be discounted from the pipeline. The effective in-transit is approximately 342 units (P13: 139, P15: 121, P16: 82). Demand is stable with a mean of ~102 units over the last 10 samples (P7-P16). To compensate for the high risk of lost shipments and ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach the target base stock, I am using an 'explicit' lead time of 3.0 to reflect the bimodal/unreliable delivery and setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle standard volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 18. Historical demand (including pre-game) is relatively stable, averaging ~103 units per period. The primary challenge is supply chain reliability. Carry-over insights and history confirm that the order from P4 (10 units), P10 (47 units), and P11 (105 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed, as they are now 4-8 periods past their order date. This means the system-reported 'In-transit' of 383 units is misleading. The effective pipeline consists only of P13 (139 units), P16 (82 units), and potentially P17 (0 units), totaling 221 units. To compensate for the 162 lost units and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I'll use a lead time of L=3 to be conservative given the bi-modal (2-3) behavior. Target inventory (base stock) should cover (L+1)=4 periods. 4 * 103 = 412 units. By setting mu_hat to 574 (412 base + 162 lost), I 'trick' the backend into ordering to replace the ghost inventory it thinks it has. This prevents persistent stockouts.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 19. The system reports 562 units in-transit. Analyzing history, orders from P4 (10), P10 (47), and P11 (105) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The order from P13 (139) is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. Accounting for these losses (10+47+105+139 = 301 units), the effective pipeline consists only of P16 (82) and P18 (179), totaling 261 units. The backend OR engine is unaware of lost shipments and treats 'In-transit' as 562, which will lead it to significantly under-order or order nothing. To force the backend to place an order that bridges the current stockout (On-hand: 0), I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~100. Based on L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand (approx 300). To compensate for the 301-unit phantom inventory the backend thinks it has, I must set mu_hat to (300 + 301) = 601. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (~2.5). Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as volatility is relatively stable.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 13 (139 units) is now highly likely lost (6 periods elapsed since order). Total confirmed/suspected lost units: 301 (P4, P10, P11, P13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe a 'starting on-hand' inventory of 139 units following the arrival of orders from P16 (lead time 3) and P18 (lead time 1). The 'In-transit' balance of 375 is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Based on history, the orders from P4 (10 units), P10 (47 units), P11 (105 units), and P13 (139 units) are significantly overdue (6+ periods) and are considered lost. This totals 301 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 74 units (from P19). The actual lead time averages 2.4 periods (observed: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this variability and ensure the base stock covers the lead time plus the review period. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the last 10 periods is approximately 105. I'll use recent_N=10 to capture this stable demand regime. Since the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will use the inflated 375 units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to inflate the base stock target and offset the 301 'phantom' units in transit. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (1+L) * Mean + Offset = (1+3) * 105 + 301 = 420 + 301 = 721.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline correction: 301 units are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13). In-transit figures should be adjusted downward by 301 when calculating order requirements.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 114 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 515 units includes several orders that are highly likely lost: Period 4 (10 units), Period 10 (47 units), Period 11 (105 units), and Period 13 (139 units), totaling 301 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 214 units (the order from Period 20). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target, effectively offsetting the 301 'phantom' units. Demand is relatively stable (mean ~102). I set L=2 (promised), but mu_hat is calculated as (1+L)*mean + lost_units = (3 * 102) + 301 = 607. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand while ignoring the lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments totaling 301 units (P4, P10, P11, P13) confirmed; effective pipeline is (In-transit - 301). Recent lead times (P18, P19) have shortened to 1 period, but I will maintain L=2 for safety due to prior volatility (2-3 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the on-hand inventory is 19 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 520 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 301 units from Periods 4, 10, 11, and 13 are confirmed/highly likely lost (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139). This means the effective pipeline is actually 219 units (520 - 301). These 219 units consist of orders from P20 (214 units) and P21 (5 units). Although recent lead times were 1 period (P18, P19), the order from P20 has not arrived in P21 conclude, suggesting a return to a lead time of 2+ periods. To protect against this volatility and the significant stockout risk (only 19 units on hand vs. average demand of ~100), I will set L=2. To account for the 'lost' units that the OR backend still thinks are coming, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively increase the target base stock. Average demand is ~100. Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be around 300 + safety stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 620, the OR backend (target = mu_hat + safety) will see a pipeline of 520 and order approximately 100+ units, which correctly compensates for the 301 missing units while covering current demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Lead time volatility continues; P20 order (214 units) did not arrive in 1 period, suggesting L >= 2. Effective pipeline remains (In-transit - 301) due to lost shipments.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0 after failing to meet demand in Period 22. The system-reported In-transit inventory of 627 units is misleading because 301 units (from P4, P10, P11, and P13) are confirmed lost based on historical lead times. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P20 (214), P21 (5), and P22 (107), totaling 326 units. The P20 order (214 units) has passed its expected 2-period lead time without arriving (ordered P20, currently P23), confirming that lead time is currently \u2265 3 periods. To bridge this gap, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 10-period average is approximately 103 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable but slightly volatile demand regime. By setting L=3 and using mu_hat based on 10 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target of roughly (1+3) * 103 = 412 units. Given the effective pipeline is 326, this should trigger an order of approximately 86 units, compensating for the lost stock and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed lead time expansion; P20 order has not arrived after 2 periods, suggesting L has reverted to 3+ periods. Effective pipeline is confirmed as (In-transit - 301).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 24. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 23 was 131, and recent demand averages approximately 101 units per period. The system reports 622 units 'In-transit', but carry-over insights confirm that 301 units are lost (from orders in Periods 4, 10, 11, and 13). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 321 units (622 - 301). Lead time has been volatile: after a brief period of 1-period arrivals (P18, P19), the P20 order (214 units) has now reached a lead time of 4 periods without arriving, and the P21 order arrived in 2 periods. I will set L to 3 to account for this recent expansion and ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent demand mean (~101) and volatility better than the full history, helping the OR backend compensate for the significant inventory deficit and the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time expansion confirmed: Period 20 order (214 units) is now at lead time 4 and has not yet arrived, while P21 arrived in 2 periods. Pipeline correction remains at -301 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we have 11 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure is 515 units, but we have identified 301 units as confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 214 units (this is the P20 order). The P20 order (214 units) has still not arrived after 4 periods (ordered P20, now P25), indicating extreme lead-time volatility or a potential loss, though we will treat it as a long lead time for now. Recent arrivals (P21, P22) showed a 2-period lead time. Demand remains stable, averaging around 100 units. To compensate for the lost stock and the uncertainty of the P20 shipment, I will set L=4 (explicit) to account for the current delay of the primary pipeline component. mu_hat is set to (1+4)*100 = 500 using the explicit method to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. sigma_hat is set to explicit 50 to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Period 20 order (214 units) has reached a lead time of 4 periods and has not arrived. Pipeline correction remains -301 units for confirmed lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 532 units includes 301 units confirmed lost (Periods 4, 10, 11, and 13). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 231 units (532 - 301). This effective pipeline includes orders from P20 (214 units) and P25 (17 units). The P20 order is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering), raising fears it may also be lost, but I will continue to treat it as delayed for now. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, but with P20 still missing at L=5, uncertainty is high. I will set L=4 (explicit) to account for this stretch. Demand is stable (recent mean ~99). Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 (covering periods 16-25) will capture this recent average. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to manage current volatility. By increasing L to 4, I signal the OR backend to increase the base stock level, compensating for the high volume of lost/delayed shipments and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Order from Period 20 (214 units) has reached a lead time of 5 periods and has not arrived. If it does not arrive by Period 27, it should be considered highly likely lost, which would bring total lost units to 515.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows Period 27 with 0 on-hand inventory and a reported in-transit of 515 units. Historical analysis confirms that orders from P4 (10), P10 (47), P11 (105), and P13 (139) are lost, totaling 301 units. Furthermore, the order from P20 (214 units) has now reached a lead time of 7 periods (P27-P20) without arriving, while subsequent orders from P21, P22, and P25 have already arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. Therefore, the P20 order is now confirmed lost. Total lost units = 301 + 214 = 515. Since the reported 'In-transit' is exactly 515, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~98 units with a standard deviation of ~17. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the zeroed-out pipeline. Since OR backend does (base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is currently 515 (all lost), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that covers at least (L+1) periods of demand. Target stock = (2+1) * 100 = 300. To get an order of ~300 when the backend subtracts 515, I would need a mu_hat of ~815. I will use 'explicit' values to force a recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Order from Period 20 (214 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total lost inventory is now 515 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20). Effective pipeline is 0 despite 'In-transit' showing 515.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 815 units is misleading because 515 units are confirmed lost (Period 4: 10, Period 10: 47, Period 11: 105, Period 13: 139, and now Period 20: 214). The effective pipeline consists only of the order from Period 27 (300 units). Demand remains stable with a mean around 102 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21 units. Lead times are volatile, recently fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to restore service levels while accounting for the 515-unit hole in the 'In-transit' data, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer and allow for a larger base stock calculation. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current demand regime and provide stable statistical inputs.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory: 515 units (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 515). Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 with 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 815 units. However, based on history, 515 units are confirmed lost (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214), as they have far exceeded any observed lead time (up to 9 periods for P20). The effective pipeline is therefore 300 units (the order from P27). This P27 order has a current lead time of 2 periods and is expected to arrive during Period 29 or 30. Demand remains stable, with the last 10 periods averaging ~103 units. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it will see 815 units and likely place no order. To compensate for the 515 lost units and prevent stockouts, I am setting L=3 (as lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods) and using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock (covering L+1 periods) accounts for the missing 515 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((L+1) * Mean Demand) + Lost Units. With L=3 and Mean Demand ~103, Base Stock = (4 * 103) + 515 = 927. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 927 / (1+L) * (1+L) = 927 to force the backend to recognize the need for more inventory despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 515) due to confirmed lost orders. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods). Base stock targets must be manually inflated to offset phantom 'In-transit' inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the 'In-transit' inventory of 954 units is severely misleading. Based on historical data and the Carry-over Insights, a total of 515 units are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, and P20). Subtracting these from the 954 'In-transit' units leaves an effective pipeline of 439 units (consisting of orders from P27, P28, and P29). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The average demand is approximately 102 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (effectively 3 periods of demand to cover: current + lead time), the base stock target should be around 306 units plus a safety buffer. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit value of 954 from its calculated base_stock, it will output a zero order unless I manually inflate mu_hat to offset the 515 lost units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (102 * 3) + 515 = 821 to force the backend to place an order that considers the lost stock, while keeping L at the promised 2 periods and sigma_hat at a recent_N to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by significant shipment losses and lead-time volatility. Total confirmed lost units are 515 (P4, P10, P11, P13, and P20), rendering the reported 'In-transit' of 815 mostly illusory. Specifically, the effective pipeline consists only of the P27 order (300 units) and the P29 order (arrived P30), leaving an actual pipeline of 300 units. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate the order. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the 515 'phantom' units, I must inflate the base stock target. Average demand is stable around 100 units/period. I will set L=3 to account for historical volatility (observed L=1 to 3). Using L=3, the target base stock (L+1 periods of demand) should be ~400 units. However, to bypass the 515 phantom units, I need the OR backend's target to be at least 715 (400 + 515 - existing on-hand). Since 300 units are actually in transit (P27 order), the backend sees 815 in transit. To trigger a sufficient order, mu_hat is set to 850 (explicit) to ensure the logic: 850 - 815 + on-hand results in a positive replenishment order to cover the stockout risk created by the lost Period 27/28 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, with a recent average (last 10 periods) of approximately 107.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 847 units, which is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments. As per the Carry-over Insights, 515 units (from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order for 300 units from Period 27 has now exceeded the promised lead time of 2 (it is now Period 32, so it has been 4 periods since the order), suggesting it might also be delayed or lost. This means the 'effective pipeline' is much lower than reported. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the phantom inventory, I am setting L to 3 (to reflect recent volatility) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target base stock. I've calculated the target based on (L+1) * mean_demand = (3+1) * 110 = 440, but since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (847) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order: mu_hat = 440 + 515 = 955. This will effectively 'neutralize' the 515 confirmed lost units in the eyes of the backend's capped base-stock policy.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Order from Period 27 (300 units) has not arrived after 4 periods; monitor for potential loss. Total confirmed lost units remains 515. Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 515).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0. In-transit is reported at 991 units, but 515 of these are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20). Additionally, the order from Period 27 (300 units) is now at lead time 5 with no arrival, making it highly likely to be lost as well. If we treat P27 as lost, the total lost inventory is 815 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 176 units (991 - 815), which consists of orders from P29 (arrived P30), P31 (32 units), and P32 (144 units). Since P29 already arrived, the 'In-transit' figure likely still includes P27, P31, and P32 plus the old losses. Demand is stable, averaging around 104 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout, I must explicitly set mu_hat to a high value to offset the phantom 'In-transit' inventory. I will set L=3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times and use an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This is calculated to target a base stock that, when the (In-transit - Lost) is subtracted, results in an order large enough to replenish the 0 on-hand balance and cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Order from Period 27 (300 units) is now highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Total suspected lost inventory is now 815 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Effective pipeline calculation: In-transit minus 815.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 34 shows 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 1235 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of the pipeline is lost. Specifically, orders from P4 (10), P10 (47), P11 (105), P13 (139), P20 (214), and now P27 (300) are confirmed or highly likely lost (over 5-7 periods elapsed). Total lost units = 815. The 'Effective Pipeline' is therefore 1235 - 815 = 420 units (representing orders from P31, P32, and P33). Demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging ~104 units per period (last 10 periods: 131, 96, 89, 91, 113, 109, 110, 111, 154, 90, 87). With a base stock target of (L+1)*Demand, and L=2, we need ~312 units. Because the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - In_transit', the 815 'phantom' units in the pipeline will prevent the OR engine from ordering unless I manually override. To force an order, I will set L to 'explicit' 2 and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom inventory: Target Base Stock (312) + Lost Units (815) = 1127. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to handle normal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Total confirmed lost inventory is 815 units (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214, P27: 300). The OR backend's pipeline calculation is inflated by 815 units; mu_hat must be explicitly increased by this amount to trigger necessary orders.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' inventory of 1235 units is severely inflated by confirmed or highly probable lost shipments. Based on the history, orders from Period 4 (10), Period 10 (47), Period 11 (105), Period 13 (139), Period 20 (214), and Period 27 (300) are confirmed lost (totaling 815 units). Additionally, the order from Period 29 (139 units) arrived, but the order from Period 31 (32 units) is now at lead time 4 and the order from Period 32 (144 units) is at lead time 3, neither having arrived. The system thinks we have 1235 units in the pipeline, but 815 are definitely gone, and 176 more are delayed. Effectively, we have very little reliable pipeline. To force the OR backend (which uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation) to place an order, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. Demand is stable around 100 units/period. For a target (L+1) = 3 periods, we need roughly 300 units. To offset the 815 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 1115 (300 base + 815 offset). This ensures the order calculation (base_stock - 1235) results in a positive replenishment. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base for calculations while keeping an eye on the persistent delivery failures.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed lost inventory remains 815 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Effective pipeline is In-transit minus 815. Recent orders P31 (32 units) and P32 (144 units) are currently overdue (L=4 and L=3 respectively), indicating continued supply instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 273 following the arrival of P32 and P33 orders. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 847 units. However, based on the historical logs and persistent non-delivery, 815 of these units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214, P27: 300). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 32 units (the P31 order). Demand remains stable, averaging approximately 102 units per period over the last 10 periods. The lead time is volatile, recently observed at 2-3 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 3 periods) without being misled by the 815 units of 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock = (Avg Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock + Lost Pipeline Correction. Calculation: (102 * 3) + (1.65 * 20 * sqrt(3)) + 815 \u2248 306 + 57 + 815 = 1178. This mu_hat value will force the OR engine to recognize the need for more stock despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $367.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we have 145 units on hand. The system reports 936 units in-transit. However, based on my tracking, 815 units are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is actually 121 units (936 - 815). These 121 units correspond to the orders from P31 (32 units) and P36 (89 units). The order from P31 is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P31, currently P37) and is likely also lost, but I will wait one more period before adding it to the 'confirmed lost' list. Demand remains stable around a mean of 103. Since the OR backend calculates 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and it uses the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 936, it will conclude that no order is needed. To force an order that accounts for the 815 lost units, I must explicitly set mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2: (1+L)*mean + z*std*sqrt(1+L). With L=2, mean=103, and std=23, and q=0.8 (z=0.84), target base stock is approx 342. Since the backend thinks we have 145 (on-hand) + 936 (in-transit) = 1081 units, I must set mu_hat to a value that makes the backend's 'pipeline' seem insufficient. I will set mu_hat to 1150 to ensure we maintain flow despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Order from Period 31 (32 units) is now highly likely lost (6 periods elapsed). If it does not arrive by Period 38, total lost inventory will be updated to 847 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 38. Demand is stable (avg ~104). The primary challenge is supply chain reliability. Confirmed lost units: P4(10), P10(47), P11(105), P13(139), P20(214), P27(300) = 815 units. Order P31 (32 units) is now at lead time 7 and is confirmed lost, bringing the total lost inventory to 847 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1034 includes these 847 phantom units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 187 units (P36: 89, P37: 98). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Base stock = (1+L) * mu. With L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~312 units). The OR engine calculates: Order = Base Stock - Pipeline. If it sees Pipeline=1034, it won't order. To force an order that accounts for the 847 lost units, I set mu_hat = ((Target Base Stock) + (Lost Units)) / (1+L). Calculation: (312 + 847) / 3 = 386.33. This ensures the backend places an order to replenish actual stock despite the inflated 'In-transit' counter.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Order from Period 31 (32 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost inventory is now 847 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31). Effective pipeline is In-transit minus 847.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 936 units, but history confirms a cumulative loss of 847 units (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214, P27: 300, P31: 32). The true effective pipeline is 936 - 847 = 89 units (specifically the order from P36). On-hand inventory is 67. Demand is stable, averaging ~100 units per period. Lead times are volatile, recently ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To correct for the 847 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend will subtract from its order calculation, I must explicitly increase the mu_hat parameter. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, we need ~300 units. To force the backend to order despite the 847 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1147 (300 target + 847 correction). This ensures the backend places an order to maintain stock levels despite the faulty in-transit data.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 77 units. The 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 1026 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 847 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, and P31). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 179 units (the order placed in P39). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the 847-unit deficit. Base stock is calculated as (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, the target is roughly 3*100 = 300 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline of 1026, I will set mu_hat to 1147 (300 target + 847 loss offset) to trigger an order that maintains availability. Lead time is set to 2 to balance recent volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: On-hand is 0, and In-transit is reported as 1107 units. However, based on historical analysis, 847 units are confirmed lost (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214, P27: 300, P31: 32). The effective pipeline is actually 260 units (orders from P39 and P40). Because the OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' figure (1107) to calculate the order quantity (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), it will significantly under-order. To compensate for this 847-unit deficit in the backend's calculation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) using the recent demand average (~100 units/period), which is 300, and then add the 847 phantom units to it, resulting in a mu_hat of 1147. This forces the backend to recognize the need for inventory despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P36, P37) suggest lead times of 1-3 periods, averaging near the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory: 847 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 847). OR backend parameters must be explicitly adjusted (inflated) to account for this phantom inventory and prevent stockouts.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we face a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' value of 1184 units is highly misleading because it includes 847 units confirmed as lost (P4: 10, P10: 47, P11: 105, P13: 139, P20: 214, P27: 300, P31: 32). The effective pipeline is actually only 337 units (1184 - 847), consisting of orders from P39 (179), P40 (81), and P41 (77). Demand remains stable, averaging ~104 units over the last 10 periods (N=10). Lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will use L=2 to ensure the OR backend aims to cover demand for the current period plus the 2-period lead time. To bypass the OR engine's use of the inflated 'In-transit' figure in its base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline), I must explicitly set mu_hat. The target base stock for a 95%+ service level (given the high profit margin) is roughly (L+1)*demand + safety stock \u2248 3*104 + 1.64*sqrt(3)*20 \u2248 312 + 57 \u2248 369. However, the backend will subtract the phantom 847 units from this. Therefore, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount to force an order. Since the OR engine uses (1+L) as a multiplier for mu_hat, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that, when combined with the backend's logic, ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for chips(Regular) is critical due to significant supply instability and a large volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 1184 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P4(10), P10(47), P11(105), P13(139), P20(214), P27(300), and P31(32), totaling 847 units. Additionally, orders from P39(179), P40(81), and P41(77) are in-transit, but given that P39 is now at L=4 and has not arrived, there is a high risk of further losses. The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent ordering because it sees 1184 units in transit. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. The desired base stock (for L=2) should be approximately (2+1)*100 = 300 units. To overcome the 847 units of 'dead' pipeline, mu_hat must be set to at least 847 + 300 = 1147. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to achieve this override. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised time while acknowledging recent volatility (1-4 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for demand variance (avg ~100, range 50-150).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a critical stockout (On-hand: 0). The primary challenge is the discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' figure (1103) and the effective pipeline. Historical analysis confirms a total of 847 units are lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31). Additionally, the order from Period 39 (179 units) is now at L=5 and is highly likely lost, bringing the suspected loss to 1026 units. The effective pipeline is approximately 1103 - 1026 = 77 units (from P41). To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, which subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at an average demand of ~102 is ~306. To overcome the 1103 phantom units and still order roughly 230 units to restore inventory, mu_hat is set to 1335 (306 + 1026). This bypasses the OR engine's 'cap' and 'pipeline' logic to force an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Order from Period 39 (179 units) is highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Total suspected lost inventory is now 1026 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). Effective pipeline is In-transit minus 1026.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we face a significant stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary challenge is a severely inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1287 units, which includes 1026 units from confirmed or highly likely lost shipments (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value to calculate its order (Order = Base Stock - In-transit), so it will not place a new order unless we artificially inflate the base stock parameters (mu_hat) to offset these 1026 'phantom' units. Demand remains stable around a mean of 105 units. Lead times are volatile, but recent arrivals (P40, P41) show a lead time of 3 periods. To ensure an order is triggered and to cover demand during the likely 3-period lead time (L=3 means covering 4 periods of demand: current + 3), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (4 periods * 105 demand) + 1026 lost units = 1446. This forces the backend to recognize that the true pipeline inventory is only ~261 units (P44 order), necessitating a substantial replenishment order to restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Order from Period 39 (179 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost inventory is now 1026 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). This phantom inventory must be offset by adding 1026 to mu_hat.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 units on-hand and an inflated In-transit figure. The 'In-transit' count of 1477 is heavily skewed by 1026 units from confirmed lost orders (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, and P39). This means the effective pipeline is only 451 units (1477 - 1026). Recent demand has stabilized with an average of approximately 105 units over the last 10 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 (plus 1 for the review period) and then add the 1026 units of lost inventory to 'trick' the backend into offsetting the 1026 units it thinks are coming. Target Mu = (1+2) * 105 = 315. Total mu_hat = 315 + 1026 = 1341. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to provide a sufficient safety buffer given the high stockout risk and lead time volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory: 1026 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 1026). mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by 1026 to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently reporting an in-transit inventory of 1477 units, but analysis of historical 'conclude' messages confirms that 1026 of these units are lost (Orders from P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, and P39). This results in an effective pipeline of only 451 units (1477 - 1026). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' inventory, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (1+L) * demand_mean. Demand has remained stable around 100-105 units. With L=2, the required base stock is approximately 300 units plus safety stock. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit', and 'in_transit' is 1026 units too high, I will set mu_hat to my forecasted requirement for the period (approx 315) plus the 1026 lost units, totaling 1341. This ensures the backend calculates a positive order quantity to replenish the current zero on-hand balance. I maintain L=2 as the baseline, noting that actual lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory: 1026 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 1026). Demand remains stable near 100 units/period. Lead time is volatile but averages near the promised 2 periods when shipments are not lost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is stable, averaging 106 units over the last 10 periods (N=10). However, the supply chain is severely compromised. Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 1026 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1477 but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock. To correct this, I must inflate mu_hat. Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and demand=106, the natural mu_hat would be 318. Adding the 1026 lost units results in a required mu_hat of 1344. This forces the OR engine to recognize that the effective pipeline is only 451 units (1477 - 1026), triggering orders to prevent the current stockout (on-hand is 0). Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent volatility (N=10) to maintain appropriate service levels.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand remains stable around 100-110 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant discrepancy between 'In-transit' inventory and actual 'Effective Pipeline' due to multiple lost shipments. As of Period 49, the system reports 1287 units in transit. However, 1026 units are confirmed lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39). Furthermore, the order from Period 44 (261 units) has now reached a lead time of 5 periods without arriving, making it highly likely lost as well. If we treat the P44 order as lost, the total lost inventory is 1287, meaning the Effective Pipeline is actually 0. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit figure from the base stock to calculate orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target and force an order. I will set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to approximately (1+L)*110 + 1287 = 1617 to ensure the backend places an order that covers the 3-period demand window despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Order from Period 44 (261 units) is highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Total suspected lost inventory is now 1287 units (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39, P44). Effective pipeline is 0; OR backend parameters must be explicitly inflated by 1287 to compensate.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 1554 units in-transit, but 1287 of these are confirmed or highly likely lost (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39, P44). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 267 units (the order from P49). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce the order quantity, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to counteract this phantom inventory. Average demand is stable at ~104 units/period. The target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at a 80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)) is approximately 340-360 units. To force an order when the backend thinks we have 1554 units, I set 'mu_hat' to (Base Stock Target + 1287). 340 + 1287 = 1627. I will use 1650 to ensure a robust order that covers current demand and replenishes the stockout caused by supply chain losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units updated to 1287 (P4, P10, P11, P13, P20, P27, P31, P39, P44). Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 1287). This massive discrepancy requires explicit inflation of mu_hat to maintain stock.
