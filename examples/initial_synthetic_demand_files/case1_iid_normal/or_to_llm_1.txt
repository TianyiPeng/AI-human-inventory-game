The OR agent recommends 127 units based on a base-stock policy that includes a safety stock margin (z-factor) to account for demand variability. Considering the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the critical fractile is 0.8, justifying a safety stock buffer. Since we have no prior arrival data to suggest lead-time drift or lost shipments yet, the OR's recommendation of 127 units is a statistically sound starting point to cover the expected demand of ~111 units plus a buffer for the upper end of the historical range (138).

Recent demand (P7-P9) is slightly higher (avg 98.3) compared to periods P5-P6. 3. Inventory: On-hand is 21, In-transit is 0. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 99 units. This is based on a base-stock policy targeting roughly 120-125 units total stock to cover the current period's demand with a safety buffer (Critical fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8). 5.

Given that the 'cap' logic in the OR baseline is meant to smooth swings but demand has repeatedly hit or exceeded 120 recently (P4=124, P11=122, P12=119), a quantity of 120 is sensible but perhaps slightly conservative if a peak occurs.

Given a lead time of 0, the total units available for demand this period will be (On-hand + Order) = 14 + 106 = 120 units.\n5. **Adjustment Strategy**: Since Period 49 is the penultimate period and Period 50 is the final period, I need to ensure sufficient stock to meet demand without over-ordering for the final stage. Demand spikes occasionally hit 120-130 (e.g., P23, P31). A total supply of 120 units for this period is slightly conservative but safe given the $1/unit holding cost versus $4/unit profit. I will follow the OR recommendation of 106 units precisely, as it sets the target stock level to 120, which has been a stable and successful pivot point for the last several periods.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The session is in its final period (Period 50). The game mechanism dictates that orders placed during the Period 50 decision phase arrive during the Period 50 arrival phase and are used to satisfy Period 50 demand. However, any inventory remaining after Period 50 demand resolution will incur holding costs without the possibility of future sales, as there is no Period 51. The current on-hand inventory is 3 units. The OR recommendation is 117 units, based on a base-stock level (\u03bc + z\u03c3) intended to cover demand. Looking at recent history, demand has been stable: Period 49 was 117, Period 48 was 106, Period 47 was 122. The average of the last 10 periods is approximately 106. To maximize the total reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory), I need to satisfy as much demand as possible while ending with near-zero inventory. Ordering exactly the expected demand minus current on-hand inventory is the optimal strategy. Given the recent average and the specifically high demand in the previous period, a quantity of 110-115 seems appropriate. I will choose 114 units (114 + 3 = 117), which aligns perfectly with the OR recommendation and recent demand peaks, minimizing the risk of a stockout in the final period while keeping potential holding costs for any leftover units low.",
