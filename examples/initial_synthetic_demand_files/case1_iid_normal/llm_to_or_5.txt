Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand data shows 5 samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], yielding a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.2. Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock to cover the review period plus the lead time (1+L = 3 periods). Given the lack of specific calendar dates or product-specific seasonal cues beyond it being a staple snack, I will use the default methods which utilize the full historical demand profile to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable baseline for the OR backend to calculate the initial order while accounting for the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. The order of 141 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3 (given the promised lead time L=2). The observed demand in Period 1 was 108, which is consistent with the historical mean of approximately 111. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1, which is expected as no inventory was initially provided. Given the target service level (q) is 0.80 (4 / (4+1)), the base stock should cover demand for (L+1) periods. Since there are no detected regime shifts in demand or lead time yet, I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat, sigma_hat, and L, which will allow the backend to use the full historical sample (N=6) and the promised lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For the first two periods, we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales as demand (108 in P1, 74 in P2) could not be met. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is scheduled to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 1+2=3. Since we are at the decision phase of Period 3, that arrival has not happened yet but is expected before demand resolution this period. The 'Period 2 conclude' message correctly shows 0 arrivals for an L=2 system. Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus recent observations [108, 74] suggests a mean demand around 105 units. Period 2 demand was lower (74), but with only one data point, it's too early to call a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent history while waiting for the pipeline to clear.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order was placed in P1 and is expected to arrive during P3's resolution phase, making it visible at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. Based on the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', if L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 and is visible in the P4 start-of-period message. The fact that P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals for the P1 order (141 units) suggests a potential delay or lead time longer than 2. However, it is too early to confirm a permanent shift. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 353 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). Demand over the last 8 periods (including pre-game) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119], with a mean of 107.25. Since we have zero on-hand and are experiencing a potential delay, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent volatility while maintaining the promised lead time L=2 for the OR backend, as we haven't seen enough 'conclude' messages to statistically prove a lead time shift yet. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 uses the most recent demand samples [138, 94, 108, 74, 119] (mean ~106.6) to calculate the base stock.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (Lead Time = 3), and Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (Lead Time = 2). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average is 2.5. Demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods has been [108, 74, 119, 124, 94] (including the historical 'Past demands' which average around 111). No strong seasonal shift is detected yet, but the lead time of 3 in the first period suggests some variability. I will use L=2 (default/promised) but monitor for further delays. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime, as the initial samples show moderate variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demands are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (seed) and [108, 74, 119, 124, 51] (observed), totaling 10 samples. The mean demand is approximately 103, though the last period saw a drop to 51. Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). The average observed lead time is 2.5 periods, which is higher than the promised 2. Currently, there is 103 units on-hand and 187 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5). Given the promised L=2 and the drift to 3, I will use L=recent_N (N=2) to capture the actual delivery speed. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (95.2) is lower than the 10-period average (103). Given the high variance and recent low demand, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to be more responsive to the recent downtrend while maintaining enough stock to cover potential spikes. Sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the actual lead time is drifting higher than the promised 2 periods. Specifically, orders from P1 and P3 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while P2 arrived in 2 periods (average lead time = 2.67). To be conservative and avoid stockouts, I am setting L to 3. Demand has shown a recent decline in the last two periods (51 and 67) compared to the long-term average of approximately 100. Using a window of N=5 (mean = 87) for mu_hat balances the older high-demand periods with the recent drop. For sigma_hat, I am using N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (3+1)=4 periods of demand, which is appropriate given the current pipeline of 256 units and on-hand inventory of 111.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is frequently 3 periods rather than the promised 2 (observed in 2 out of 3 concluded shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows an average of approximately 95.8 over the last 12 observations (including pre-game data). Recent demand (last 4 periods) is lower at 86.25, but given the variability, I will stick to a 5-period average for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture recent trends while maintaining stability. Looking at lead times: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P2 in 2 periods, P3 in 3 periods, and P5 in 2 periods. The Carry-over Insight correctly flags that lead time frequently hits 3 periods. To be conservative and avoid stockouts given the 117 on-hand units and 183 in-transit, I will set L to 3. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand. Sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (excluding pre-game data) is [124, 51, 67, 103, 92], with a mean of 87.4. Including pre-game data, the overall mean is approximately 100. Demand appears stable without a clear seasonal or regime shift. Regarding lead time, we've observed values of [3, 2, 3, 2, 2] across 5 concluded shipments. While the carry-over insight noted a shift to 3, the most recent three shipments arrived with lead times of [3, 2, 2], averaging 2.33. This suggests the promised lead time of 2 is mostly reliable but slightly volatile. Currently, we have 169 units on-hand and 165 in-transit (orders from P7 and P8). The OR backend uses (1+L) for base stock; setting L to 'calculate' (average ~2.3) or 'explicit' 2 provides a safety buffer. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed variability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the last 8 samples (including pre-game) to capture a stable demand profile (N=8).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 69 units with 218 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 9 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 93.1 units per period. The Carry-over insight and arrival history (P1 arrived at P4, P3 arrived at P6) indicate that the actual lead time (L) frequently drifts to 3 periods instead of the promised 2. Currently, the order from Period 7 (36 units) is overdue if L=2, and the order from Period 8 (126 units) is expected soon. Given that the lead time is often 3, I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the average of the last 9 samples (approx 93) multiplied by (1+L) = 4, totaling 372. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 152 with 183 units in transit (ordered in P9 and P10). Demand for the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 91.7 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) averaging 88.2 units, showing a slight decrease from the initial samples. Lead time analysis shows a mix: P1, P3, and P7 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while P2, P5, P6, and P8 arrived with 2 periods. The Carry-over insight correctly flags that actual lead time is often 3. Given the variability in arrival times (2-3 periods), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval (L+1 = 4 periods). I will use the last 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand distribution for this SKU while accounting for the lead time uncertainty. This conservative approach balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost by maintaining a slightly higher safety stock for the 'chips(Regular)' category.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe an on-hand inventory of 30 and 255 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods (P1:3, P2:2, P3:3, P5:2, P6:2, P7:3, P8:2). To be conservative and prevent stockouts given the volatility, I am setting L to 3. Historically, demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shifts; the last 5 demands are [103, 92, 100, 79, 122], averaging 99.2. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering all game history) for mu_hat to capture the full distribution, which averages 94.45 per period. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR backend targets a pipeline covering (3+1) periods of demand (~378 units), which is appropriate given we have 285 units total currently. This approach balances the risk of delayed arrivals with the holding cost of units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory and 36 units of lost sales (demand 119 vs sold 83). The current inventory state is critical: 0 on-hand and 336 in-transit. Based on the lead time analysis of concluded periods, lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods (P1:3, P2:2, P3:3, P5:2, P6:2, P7:3, P8:2, P9:3). Given the stockout and the inconsistency, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative and ensure the base stock covers the longer potential cycle. For demand forecasting, the last 12 periods show a mean of 96.5. Recent demand has been higher (P11: 122, P12: 119), but looking at the full history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 108, 74, 119, 124, 51, 67, 103, 92, 100, 79, 122, 119], there is no sustained regime shift. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat which utilizes all 17 available data points (5 past + 12 game history) to calculate the requirement for (1+L) periods. Setting L=3 helps the OR backend target a higher base stock level to buffer against lead time variability and the current stockout.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a fluctuating lead time between 2 and 3 periods, with an average observed lead time of 2.5. The shipment from Period 10 (127 units) has not arrived as of the Period 13 conclusion, suggesting it may arrive in Period 14 (L=4) or is potentially delayed/lost. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and demand was missed in Periods 12 and 13 due to stockouts. To account for the variability and recent delays, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of typical observations). For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture the recent average of ~96 units per period, which includes the recent demand of 102. Sigma_hat is set to the default calculation to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed variance in this period. The total pipeline (443) is significant, but with on-hand at 0 and missed demand, a slightly higher L helps the base-stock calculation protect against further stockouts if the P10 shipment is lost or further delayed.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time fluctuates between 2 and 3 periods (Average ~2.5); Period 10 shipment is currently overdue (L > 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $506.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is critical (6 units). Total in-transit is 309, consisting of orders from P10 (127), P11 (72), and P13 (107). The order from Period 10 is now significantly overdue (lead time 5+ periods), suggesting a lost shipment as hinted in the 'Carry-over Insights'. The order from Period 11 is also at L=4. If P10 is indeed lost, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 182 (P11 + P13), not 309. To prevent stockouts, I will set an explicit Lead Time of 3 to account for the observed delays (actual L often fluctuates between 2 and 3). For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods show a slight upward trend (avg ~114 vs total avg ~101). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this recent increase. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. By increasing L to 3, I am signaling the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock level to buffer against lead time variability and the likelihood of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 10 (127 units) is 3 periods past promised delivery and 2 periods past the observed max lead time of 3, likely lost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The order from Period 10 (127 units) is now 6 periods since placement, confirming it is lost given the max observed lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 452 units includes this lost shipment, plus orders from Period 11 (72), Period 13 (107), Period 15 (143), and potentially the order from Period 14 (which was 0). Adjusting for the lost shipment, effective pipeline is 325. Lead times have been inconsistent, averaging 2.5 periods (observed: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2). I will set L to 3 to be conservative and ensure the base stock covers the current cycle and the likely delayed arrivals. Demand is stable around 100-110 units (last 5 periods: 122, 119, 102, 128, 112; mean=116.6). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the slight uptick in demand compared to earlier periods, and using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 10 (127 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, max lead time is 3). Effective pipeline is 325 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 108 units. The Carry-over insights confirm that the order from Period 10 (127 units) is lost. Current In-transit inventory (484 units) includes orders from P11 (72), P13 (107), P15 (143), and P16 (32), plus the lost P10 (127) which the OR backend still counts in its pipeline. Because the backend doesn't know P10 is lost, the effective pipeline is actually 357 units (484 - 127). To compensate for the lost units and ensure the base stock is reached, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the observed max lead time) and mu_hat to 432 (calculated as (1+3) * 108) to cover the 4-period risk horizon. This higher mu_hat will push the backend to order more, effectively replacing the lost shipment. Sigma_hat is set to 40 using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods, averaging approximately 105 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is low (34 units), and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline. The shipment from Period 10 (127 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now Period 18 and the maximum observed lead time is 3. The effective in-transit inventory is 139 units (P13: 107, P16: 32). The shipment from P13 (107 units) is currently at L=5 and is highly likely lost as well, though not yet officially confirmed by the 6-period rule used in previous insights. Because actual lead times frequently hit 3 periods, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation covers an additional period of demand (L+1=4). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (approx. 105 units/period) while filtering out the very early initialization noise.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 13 (107 units) is 5 periods old (L=5) and likely lost, following the pattern of the confirmed lost Period 10 shipment.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 18. Historical demand for the last 5 periods [112, 79, 109, 76] averages ~94 units, showing stability despite the stockouts caused by delivery delays. The lead time situation is the primary concern: the promised lead time is 2, but observed actuals are often 3. More critically, the shipment from Period 10 (127 units) is confirmed lost, and the shipment from Period 13 (107 units) is now 6 periods old (ordered P13, not arrived by P18 conclude) and must also be considered lost. Total in-transit is 412, but removing the likely lost 107 units leaves an effective pipeline of 305 units (P16: 32, P18: 71, and possibly others from P11, P12, etc. that were skipped in the history summary but are part of the '412' count). To account for the frequent L=3 and the inventory 'hole' created by the P13 loss, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers an extra period. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~100/period) while smoothing volatility, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a buffer against demand spikes and lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 13 (107 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, lead time max is 3). Total confirmed lost inventory now includes P10 (127) and P13 (107).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory. The history shows two confirmed lost shipments (Period 10 and Period 13), each of which reached 6 periods without arrival. The current in-transit inventory is listed as 340 units, but this includes the order from Period 19 (31 units). Based on lead time history (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of ~2.4), we should treat L as 2 (explicit) to align with the backend's promised lead time while acknowledging the instability. Demand remains relatively stable (mean ~104). To account for the stockouts caused by lost orders and recent high demand (122 in P19), I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility and level. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand (L+1=3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Observed range 1-3 periods, with significant risk of lost shipments (P10 and P13 confirmed lost after 6 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' has 0 on-hand inventory and 311 units in-transit. Analyzing the game history, shipments from Period 10 (127 units) and Period 13 (107 units) are confirmed lost as they are more than 6 periods past their order date (exceeding the observed max lead time of 3). Recent arrivals in Period 19 (L=1, L=3) and Period 20 (L=1) show lead time is highly volatile but currently trending shorter (Avg L \u2248 1.66 for last 3 arrivals). The demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P16-P20) averaging 97.6 units. To account for the lost shipments in the OR backend's calculation, I must adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat, and orders = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Since 'pipeline_inventory' includes the 234 lost units (P10+P13), I will use 'explicit' methods to set values that effectively ignore these 'ghost' units. I estimate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period coverage (using L=2 as a safer buffer) to be approximately 300 units (100 avg demand * 3). However, to trigger an order despite the 311 'in-transit' units, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the actual needed inventory plus the lost units. I will set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 540 (to cover 3 periods of demand + 234 lost units), and sigma_hat to 70 to maintain a high service level given the volatility and previous stockouts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, with the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averaging 100.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows 558 units in-transit. However, based on history, orders from Period 10 (127 units) and Period 13 (107 units) are confirmed lost, and the order from Period 11 (72 units) is now 11 periods old with no arrival, making it also lost. Subtracting these (127+107+72=306) from the reported 558 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 252 units (primarily from P15, P20, and P21). The lead time varies between 1-3 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time plus the current period (L+1), and to account for the risk of lost shipments, I will use an explicit L of 3 to calculate the base stock. For demand, I'll use the recent average of 100 units/period (recent_N=10). This setting helps the OR engine target a base stock sufficient to bridge the gaps caused by erratic arrivals and lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 11 (72 units) is now 11 periods old and confirmed lost (joining P10 and P13). Total confirmed lost inventory is 306 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits significant lead-time instability and recurring inventory loss. Three shipments (P10: 127 units, P13: 107 units, P11: 72 units) are now confirmed lost as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin (P11 is 11 periods old). The current in-transit figure of 558 units includes these 306 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 252 units (P20: 2 units, P21: 247 units, P22: 0 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts for several periods. To compensate for the lost inventory and ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I am calculating mu_hat based on an (L+1) horizon (4 periods) and the average demand from the last 10 periods (~102 units), plus an additional 306 units to 'trick' the backend into replacing the 306 units it believes are still in transit but are actually lost. Demand has been relatively stable (mean ~102, std ~20).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lost inventory total: 306 units (P10: 127, P13: 107, P11: 72). Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 306).

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: On-hand inventory is 116 units. The in-transit pipeline is 497 units, but 306 units are confirmed lost (P10, P11, P13). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 191 units (497 - 306). These active orders are from Period 20 (2 units) and Period 23 (186 units). Period 20's order is at L=3 and may still arrive or be lost soon. 

Demand Analysis: Demand remains stable with no clear seasonal or regime shifts detected. The last 10 periods of demand average approximately 103.5 units. 

Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times are 1, 2, or 3 periods, with a high frequency of lost shipments. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a buffer against the high variance and loss rate.

OR Strategy: By setting L=3, the backend will target a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while ignoring the initial startup noise. This ensures the OR engine maintains a service level sufficient to handle the 1-3 period lead time variability while accounting for the reality that a large portion of the 'In-transit' figure is non-existent inventory.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 25. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, with the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging 100.8 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. Most critically, three shipments (P10: 127, P13: 107, P11: 72) totaling 306 units are confirmed lost, as they are 12+ periods old. The reported in-transit inventory is 497 units, but the effective pipeline is only 191 units (497 - 306). The backend OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to order. Since the engine does not know about lost orders, it will think the pipeline is full (497) and under-order. To fix this, I will set 'L' to an 'explicit' value of 6. By increasing L from 2 to 6, I increase the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu) to compensate for the 306 phantom units in the pipeline. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (~100/period), and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=10 to provide a safety buffer for lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; cumulative lost inventory remains 306 units (P10, P11, P13).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 628 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, orders from Period 10 (127), Period 11 (72), and Period 13 (107) are confirmed lost, totaling 306 units. The actual effective pipeline is 322 units (628 - 306). The orders currently in the pipeline are from P20 (2 units, now 6 periods old and likely lost, but negligible), P23 (186 units, 3 periods old), and P25 (131 units, 1 period old). The demand remains stable with a mean of ~102 units. Given the frequent stockouts (OH=0) and the risk of lost shipments, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L). The 'calculate' method for L will account for the high variance (1-3 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 10 periods to capture current volatility while ignoring the earliest history. The OR engine will subtract the pipeline (322) from the base stock to determine the order, effectively compensating for the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 20 (2 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, consistent with the pattern of P10, P11, and P13.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with the most recent 10 periods averaging approximately 101 units. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability. The lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2), with a significant risk of lost shipments. Shipments from P10 (127), P11 (72), P13 (107), and P20 (2) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 308 lost units. Current in-transit is 497, but the effective pipeline is only 189 units (497 - 308). The OR engine's capped policy uses (base_stock - pipeline). To account for the 308 lost units and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5. Since base_stock = (1+L) * mu, increasing L from 2 to 5 adds 3 * 101 = 303 units to the target base stock, effectively offsetting the ~308 lost units currently sitting in the 'in-transit' calculation. This ensures the engine places an order sufficient to cover demand despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 20 (2 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed lost inventory now includes P10, P11, P13, and P20, totaling 308 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we face zero on-hand inventory. Our pipeline reconciliation is critical: the total In-transit is 590 units. According to historical patterns and the Carry-over Insights, we must subtract confirmed lost shipments to calculate the 'effective pipeline'. Specifically, orders from P10 (127), P11 (72), P13 (107), and P20 (2) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 308 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 590 - 308 = 282 units. These 282 units consist of orders from P18 (71, possibly delayed or lost, but not yet confirmed), P23 (186), and P27 (93). Demand remains stable around an average of 102 units. To protect against the high lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods, plus loss risk), I am setting L to 3 periods (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most current demand mean and variance, which helps the OR backend set a safety stock level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory position for chips(Regular) is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 590 units, but a significant portion is confirmed lost. Based on history, orders from P10 (127), P11 (72), P13 (107), and P20 (2) are lost, totaling 308 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 590 - 308 = 282 units (consisting of orders from P23, P25, and P27). Demand remains stable around a mean of 101 units per period (avg of last 10 samples: 101.3). Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%, which the OR backend will target via the base stock formula. I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will use mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to capture recent demand stability and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for (L+1) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated from the last 15 periods to reflect current volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 590 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, 308 units are confirmed lost (P10: 127, P11: 72, P13: 107, P20: 2), leaving an effective pipeline of 282 units (P23: 186, P27: 96). Demand remains stable with a mean of ~101 over the last 15 periods (excluding stockouts). With a promised lead time of 2 and observed lead times varying between 1-3 periods, the base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should target ~303 units (3 * 101). Since the effective pipeline (282) is below this target and we are currently stocked out, I will set L to 2 and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (N=15).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable, with the most recent five periods (P26-P30) averaging approximately 106.8 units per period. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and while in-transit shows 590 units, 308 of those are confirmed lost (P10, P11, P13, P20). This leaves an effective pipeline of 282 units. The last order placed was 93 units in Period 27. Since then (P28, P29, P30), zero orders were placed by the previous controller, likely due to the inflated 'in-transit' figure including lost shipments. Lead times have shown significant volatility (1-3 periods) and high loss rates. To restore service levels and compensate for the lost pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods) using the recent demand regime (N=5). I choose L=explicit at 2 to keep the OR backend's safety stock calculation grounded in the promised lead time, while mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent stable but high-demand period to trigger sufficient replenishment to overcome the 0 on-hand status.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 32. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 590 units. Based on historical data, shipments from P10 (127), P11 (72), P13 (107), and P20 (2) are confirmed lost, totaling 308 units. The remaining effective pipeline is 282 units (590 - 308), consisting of shipments from P18 (71 - though P18 arrived in P19, the logic must reconcile the 'In-transit' figure provided by the system), P23 (186), and P27 (93). Note: The system shows 590 in transit, but looking at 'ordered' history: P21(247-arrived), P23(186), P25(131-arrived), P27(93). The sum of all 'un-arrived' orders in history is P4(3), P10(127), P11(72), P13(107), P20(2), P23(186), P27(93) = 590. This perfectly matches the In-transit figure. Removing the confirmed lost (P10, P11, P13, P20 = 308) and the tiny P4 outlier, the effective pipeline is 279 units (P23+P27). Demand is stable around 100-110, with a recent spike to 154 in P31. I will set L to 3 to account for historical volatility and use recent_N for demand to capture the current mean while being protected by the backend's base-stock logic. The goal is to resume ordering to replenish the 0 on-hand stock, factoring in that ~50% of current in-transit is lost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 590 units. History reveals a critical loss of 308 units (P10, P11, P13, P20). Additionally, orders from P23 (186 units) and P27 (93 units) are now at 10 and 6 periods old respectively; given that the maximum observed lead time for a successful delivery is 3 periods, these 279 units (186+93) must also be treated as lost. This brings total confirmed lost units to 587 (308 + 279). Subtracting this from the in-transit balance of 590 leaves an effective pipeline of only 3 units. Recent demand (P31-P32) shows a slight uptick/volatility (154, 90). Since the effective pipeline is nearly zero and on-hand is zero, a significant re-order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture recent demand levels and set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed, providing a safety buffer for the backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 23 (186 units) and Period 27 (93 units) are confirmed lost (10 and 6 periods elapsed respectively). Total confirmed lost inventory now stands at 587 units (P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by significant lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and a high frequency of lost shipments. As of Period 33, a total of 587 units from orders placed in Periods 10, 11, 13, 20, 23, and 27 are confirmed lost (exceeding maximum observed lead time of 3 by several periods). The 'In-transit' figure of 590 includes these 587 lost units plus a small residual (likely the 3 units from P4 which never arrived or were miscounted). Effectively, the pipeline inventory is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0, leading to persistent stockouts since Period 27. Demand has remained relatively stable, averaging approximately 101 units per period over the last 10 periods. To recover from the stockout and account for the high loss rate, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock covers the extended arrival window. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand level (~101/unit/period) across the (L+1) window. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for the same period to account for recent demand volatility. By effectively treating the 'In-transit' as zero (due to losses), the OR engine will place a large order to restore the base stock level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for several periods. The current In-transit total is 590 units, but based on historical analysis and previous carry-over insights, a significant portion of this pipeline is likely lost. Specifically, 587 units from orders placed on P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, and P27 have been confirmed lost as they are well past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 3 units (590 total in-transit - 587 confirmed lost). To recover from this stockout and account for the high probability of shipment failure, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 (the observed historical maximum) and an explicit mu_hat. Recent demand (last 10 samples) averages approximately 102 units. For a lead time of 3, the OR backend requires mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods, so 4 * 102 = 408. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to ensure a robust safety stock, given the frequent stockouts and lead time volatility. This configuration should trigger a substantial order to replenish stock and cover the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory remains at 587 units (P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 587). Current on-hand is 0, requiring aggressive replenishment.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 36. On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-Transit is 590 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, and P27 are confirmed lost, totaling 587 units (127+72+107+2+186+93). This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 3 units (590 - 587). Since on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is nearly 0, we must replenish aggressively. Demand has been relatively stable with a slight increase in variance lately; the mean demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 104 units. To account for the risk of lost shipments and lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. mu_hat will be set to (1+3)*104 = 416 using the recent_N method (N=15) to capture recent demand levels. sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=15) to account for recent volatility. This setup will trigger a large order to refill the empty pipeline and satisfy the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 590 units. However, based on historical evidence, 587 of these units (from Periods 10, 11, 13, 20, 23, and 27) are confirmed lost as they are far beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore only 3 units (the total in-transit 590 minus the 587 lost units). Demand has remained relatively stable, with the mean of the last 20 samples being approximately 105 units. With the current on-hand inventory at 0 and almost no reliable pipeline, an aggressive replenishment order is required to restore the base stock level. I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed upper bound of lead time) and mu_hat using recent_N=20 to capture the stable demand mean. This will trigger the OR backend to place a significant order to cover the (L+1) demand window while correctly discounting the lost 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, total confirmed lost inventory remains at 587 units (P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). Any order logic must subtract these 587 units from the reported 'In-transit' to calculate the true effective pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38, the system reports an in-transit inventory of 590 units. However, based on historical evidence spanning Periods 10 through 27, a total of 587 units are confirmed lost (P10: 127, P11: 72, P13: 107, P20: 2, P23: 186, P27: 93). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 3 units (590 - 587). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To trigger the OR backend to place an order that covers the on-hand deficit and the lost pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that reflects both the expected demand over (L+1) periods and the replenishment needed to offset the 587 lost units. Mean demand is approximately 103 units per period. For the promised L=2, (L+1) demand is ~309. Adding the 587 units of lost inventory that the backend incorrectly thinks is arriving, the required base stock is approximately 896. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set this value (309 + 587 = 896) to force a replenishment order. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent successfully arrived shipments hovered between 1-3 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'default' to handle standard volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39, the system shows 923 units in-transit. However, based on history, 587 of these units are confirmed lost (shipments from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, and P27). The effective pipeline is therefore 336 units (923 total - 587 lost), which is primarily comprised of the order placed in Period 38 (333 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the past several periods. Demand remains stable, with recent samples (P34-P38) averaging approximately 100 units per period. I am setting L to 3 to account for the upper end of the observed actual lead-time range (1-3 periods). mu_hat is set to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat (avg ~100) and sigma_hat yields a target base stock that justifies the current large in-transit order while signaling the OR backend to maintain aggressive replenishment until on-hand stock is restored.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 254 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 590 units; however, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that 587 of these units (from orders in P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, and P27) are lost. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is only 3 units. Recent demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) averages approximately 102 units per period with a standard deviation of 23. To maintain a high service level while accounting for lead time volatility (which has varied between 1 and 3 periods recently), I am setting L to the promised 2 periods. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current demand regime (~102 * 3 = 306). Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the observed standard deviation of ~23 adjusted for the lead time (sqrt(3) * 23 \u2248 40). This configuration ensures the OR backend recognizes the low effective pipeline and triggers necessary replenishment to avoid stockouts, while the high on-hand inventory from the P38 arrival provides a temporary buffer.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system reports on-hand inventory of 138 units and in-transit inventory of 590 units. According to the carry-over insights, 587 units of the in-transit inventory are confirmed lost (shipments from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 3 units (590 - 587). This means total available inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 141 units. Historical demand remains stable around a mean of 102 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21. Given the promised lead time (L=2), we need to cover demand for L+1 (3) periods. 3 periods of demand is approximately 306 units. To bridge the gap between reported and effective inventory, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2.0 (the promised value) and mu_hat to 'explicit' at 730. Setting mu_hat to 730 (which is (1+L) * 102 + 424) effectively tricks the OR backend into ordering enough to compensate for the 587 lost units while accounting for current on-hand inventory, as the backend subtracts the (mostly phantom) in-transit total from its base stock calculation. This ensures we replenish enough to avoid stockouts caused by the lost shipments.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, on-hand inventory is 19 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 622 units, but based on the Carry-over Insights, 587 units (from orders in Periods 10, 11, 13, 20, 23, and 27) are confirmed lost. Thus, the true effective pipeline is 35 units (622 - 587). The most recent order was placed in Period 41 (32 units) and has not yet arrived. Demand remains stable, with the last 10 periods averaging approximately 99 units. To prevent stockouts, I need to set mu_hat to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1). With an inferred lead time (L) of 2, mu_hat should target ~300 units. By using 'explicit' for L and mu_hat, I can bypass the OR backend's unawareness of the 587 lost units. I am setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat=300 (approx. 100 per period for 3 periods). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=10 to capture current volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current state shows 0 units on-hand and an in-transit inventory of 622 units. According to the historical Carry-over Insights, 587 of these units are confirmed lost (P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 35 units (622 - 587). The most recent order placed was in Period 41 (32 units), which has not arrived yet. Given a lead time of 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 43's resolution. However, demand has been consistent, averaging approximately 105 units over the last 5 periods (79, 79, 116, 119, 114). To avoid stockouts and account for the high loss rate, I must set the mu_hat to cover at least (L+1) periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 105/period). To handle the lost inventory discrepancy, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 to maintain the promised lead time logic while the mu_hat and sigma_hat ensure the target base stock is high enough to trigger a significant replenishment order, given the backend will see a high pipeline (622) and likely under-order unless the base stock is sufficiently high.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 44. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' is 622 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 587 units (from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the shipment from Period 41 (32 units) is now 3 periods old; while 3 periods is within the observed lead time range, most recent successful shipments (P25, P38) arrived in 1 period. Therefore, the effective pipeline is likely 35 units (622 - 587) or less. With zero on-hand and a high likelihood of 587 units never arriving, the OR backend needs to be 'tricked' into ordering enough to cover the deficit. I will use the 'explicit' method for L to reflect the average actual lead time of 2.5 periods (rounding to 3 for safety). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent demand mean of ~107 units per period. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to a higher value to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the high variance in lead times and the risk of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, total confirmed lost inventory remains at 587 units (P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). Effective pipeline inventory is reported 'In-transit' minus 587.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 590 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 587 of these units are confirmed lost (shipments from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, and P27). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 3 units (590 - 587). The OR backend uses reported 'in-transit' in its base-stock calculation. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these phantom lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Specifically, I set mu_hat to (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + (Reported Lost Units). Historical demand mean is approximately 104 units. With an estimated lead time L=2 (Promised=2, though volatile), the target base stock should cover 3 periods (L+1), which is ~312 units. Adding the 587 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 899. This ensures the OR logic (Order = Base Stock - In Transit) accounts for the lost shipments properly. For sigma_hat, I use the default calculation across all samples to capture demand volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' quantity of 923 units. Based on historical data and Carry-Over Insights, 587 units from this total are confirmed lost (P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). This means the effective pipeline inventory is 336 units (923 - 587). The most recent order of 333 units from Period 45 is currently in transit. Lead times for concluded orders have ranged from 1 to 3 periods, with several instances of lost shipments. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with the last 5 periods showing demands of [119, 114, 83, 106, 103], averaging approximately 105 units. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover current demand and replenish stock while accounting for the significant inventory loss, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1) at the recent average. By using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, I can bypass the OR backend's standard calculations which don't account for the 'phantom' lost inventory in the pipeline, effectively forcing a replenishment cycle despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains steady around 100 units/period (average of last 5 periods: 106.2). The backend reports 923 units in-transit. However, cumulative evidence (Period 10, 11, 13, 20, 23, 27) confirms that 587 units of this pipeline are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 923 - 587 = 336 units. This 336 consists of the order from Period 45 (333 units) and potentially some small remainder from earlier. Since the Period 45 order is currently at L=2, it is expected to arrive during Period 47 or 48. To ensure the OR backend places an order if needed, I must adjust L to account for the actual observed variability (avg ~2-3) and set mu_hat based on recent stable demand. By setting L to explicit 3 and mu_hat to recent_N (N=5), I ensure the base stock calculation covers (3+1) periods of demand (~425 units), which exceeds the 336 units of effective pipeline, prompting a replenishment order to recover from the current stockout.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' inventory is 923 units. However, based on extensive history (see carry-over insights), 587 units from Periods 10, 11, 13, 20, 23, and 27 are confirmed lost. Additionally, the shipment from Period 45 (333 units) is now 3 periods old; given the historical lead time variation (1-3 periods), it is expected to arrive during Period 48. This makes the effective pipeline 336 units (923 total - 587 lost). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 10 periods. To ensure we don't stock out while accounting for the high shipment loss rate, I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) using a recent 10-period average. Since we are approaching the end of the game (Period 48/50) and have zero on-hand inventory, I will keep parameters steady to trigger an order that bridges the gap between the effective pipeline and required stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the reported on-hand inventory is 227 units and reported in-transit is 590 units. Based on cumulative carry-over insights, 587 units of the in-transit inventory are confirmed lost (shipments from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, and P27). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 3 units (590 - 587). The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable throughout the history, with the most recent demands being [103, 105, 122, 106]. The average demand is approximately 104 units per period. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average closer to 2.5. To maintain the target service level (q=0.8) and account for lead-time volatility, I am setting L to 3 periods to cover the longer end of the delivery spectrum. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx. 416 units for L+1). sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current demand volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend recognizes the true inventory shortage caused by the lost shipments and places an order to cover the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 110 units. Reported In-transit is 590 units. Based on historical Carry-over Insights (confirmed in Periods 16, 19, 22, 27, 33, 37, and 44), 587 units of this pipeline are confirmed lost (Orders from P10, P11, P13, P20, P23, P27). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 3 units (590 - 587). The actual lead time fluctuates significantly between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.5 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable, with recent samples (P45-P49) averaging 110.6 units per period. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the (L+1) period demand window (3-4 periods) while correctly accounting for the lost shipments, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) and set 'L' to 'explicit' at 2 to represent the promised lead time, while allowing the base stock calculation to bridge the gap. Given the 110 on-hand and only 3 valid units in transit, the OR engine needs to replenish approximately 300+ units to meet the target base stock (~440-500 units).
