The historical demand samples provided are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], giving an average of approximately 111.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6 (L=4). To avoid stockouts, I need to cover the lead time plus the period in which the order is placed (L+1 = 5 periods). Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, I will order enough to cover approximately 5 periods of demand. 5 * 111.4 = 557 units. I will round slightly to 560 to provide a small buffer for variance while being mindful of the $1.00 holding cost.",

The goal was to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). Period 1 concluded with a demand of 108, which aligns closely with the historical samples ([112, 97, 116, 138, 94], mean=111.4). Current status: On-hand is 0, and 560 units are in-transit. Since the lead time is 4 periods, I expect the first arrival in Period 5. To maintain a healthy pipeline and satisfy demand across the (L+1) window (Periods 2 to 6), I need a total inventory position of roughly 112 * 5 = 560 units. Since I already have 560 in transit and 0 on hand, the current position is 560. However, because demand occurs after the arrival phase, and the order placed today (Period 2) will arrive in Period 6, I need to ensure the quantity in flight covers demand through Period 6. Calculating (L+1) target: 112 * 5 = 560. Current position (On-hand 0 + In-transit 560) is exactly 560. To stay ahead of the next cycle, I will order enough to cover Period 6's expected demand (112 units).",

Total demand for 5 periods @ 110 units/period = 550 units. We currently have 672 units in the pipeline.

The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. As of Period 45, we are approaching the game end (Period 50). The pipeline is as follows: Period 41 order (115 units) arrives in P45; P42 order (105 units) arrives in P46; P43 order (120 units) arrives in P47; P44 order (100 units) arrives in P48. My decision in P45 will arrive in P49. Any order placed in P46 would arrive in P50. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Current on-hand is 29. Expected sequence: P45 start (29) + P41 arrival (115) - Demand (~105) = ~39 ending; P46 start (39) + P42 arrival (105) - Demand (~105) = ~39 ending; P47 start (39) + P43 arrival (120) - Demand (~105) = ~54 ending; P48 start (54) + P44 arrival (100) - Demand (~105) = ~49 ending. Total inventory available for P49 demand is ~49 units. To cover P49 demand (est. 105 units), I need an additional ~56 units. I will order 70 units today (P45) to arrive in P49, providing a small safety buffer for that final period without excessive holding costs.",

Total demand for the remaining periods (P46-P50) is estimated at 110 * 5 = 550 units. Currently, On-hand is 41 and In-transit is 395 (total pipeline = 436). The pending arrivals for the rest of the game are: P46 (ordered P42: 105), P47 (ordered P43: 120), P48 (ordered P44: 100), and P49 (ordered P45: 70). An order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. To cover the total projected demand of 550 units with the existing pipeline of 436 units, we need 114 units. However, we must also ensure we don't stock out in any single period. Current On-hand (41) + P46 arrival (105) = 146, which covers P46 demand. Sum of pipeline ensures availability for P47-P49. Ordering 115 units in P46 will cover P50 demand and minimize ending inventory.",

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With the game ending at Period 50, orders placed in Period 47 will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the active game window.

These arrivals, combined with the current on-hand inventory of 41, are sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~105 units/period for the remaining 4 periods (Total supply: 41 + 120 + 100 + 70 + 115 = 446; Total expected demand: 4 * 105 = 420).

Based on the delivery schedule: the Period 45 order (70 units) arrives in Period 49, and the Period 46 order (115 units) arrives in Period 50. Total expected availability for Period 49 is 33 (on-hand) + 70 (arriving) = 103 units. Total expected availability for Period 50 is (103 - Period 49 demand) + 115 (arriving). Given the stable demand mean of approximately 105-110 units, our existing pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the remaining two periods of demand without incurring additional holding costs for stock that arrives after the game ends.
