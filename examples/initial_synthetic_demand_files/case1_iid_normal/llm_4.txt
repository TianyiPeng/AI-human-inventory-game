No orders were placed in P40 and P41; continuing this strategy until the on-hand stock aligns more closely with a 1-2 period buffer.",

Total projected supply for P49-P50 is 47 + 180 = 227. This covers the expected 210 units of demand with a small buffer. Any order placed now carries a high risk of being charged holding cost at the end of P50 if demand is lower than expected or if arrivals cluster.

(d) Current on-hand inventory is 0. (e) Since this is the final period, any order placed now will arrive after the game ends and will not contribute to units sold or incur holding costs (as arrivals happen in the resolution phase after the final decision). However, any units that arrive *during* Period 50 resolution from previous orders would be sold. Looking at the pipeline, order P48 was placed 2 periods ago and P49 1 period ago. Given current lead times (2-3 periods), there is a high probability P48 (80 units) arrives during Period 50 resolution. To maximize reward, we want to satisfy Period 50 demand (est. 110) without carrying over excess stock. Since on-hand is 0 and only ~80 units are expected to arrive, there is no risk of excess holding cost from new orders. More importantly, an order placed now in P50 will never arrive before the game ends.
