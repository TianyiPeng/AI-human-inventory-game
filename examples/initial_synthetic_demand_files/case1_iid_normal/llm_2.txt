We need to cover demand for Period 15, 16, and 17 (L+1 periods) while accounting for the high probability that the P10 order (100) and possibly P11 (80) are lost. e) Order Logic: Estimated demand for 3 periods is ~330 units. Reliability of 'In-transit' is low. Excluding the likely lost P10/P11 orders (180 units), we have 230 reliable units in transit.
