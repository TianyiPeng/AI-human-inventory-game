Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The past demand for chips(Regular) shows values [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there are no concluded periods yet, I will use the 'default' lead time method. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the baseline demand level. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (current period + 4 lead time periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 141 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 6 samples (including the concluded Period 1) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107], with a mean of approximately 110.7. There is no evidence of a regime shift or lead time deviation yet. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and the mean of all available demand samples to establish the base stock level. The formula (1+L)*\u03bc covers demand for the current period plus the lead time. With L=4, mu_hat should reflect demand over 5 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows values [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] from historical data and [107, 116] from Period 1 and Period 2, indicating a stable mean around 111 units. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have not yet reached Period 5 (P1+4), we haven't seen any arrivals; 'arrived=0' in Period 1 and 2 is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or loss. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (sold=0), while 278 units (141 from P1 + 137 from P2) are in transit. To ensure we meet demand once lead time elapses, I will use 'default' settings for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This relies on the backend to use the promised L=4 and calculate the demand across (1+L)=5 periods based on all available history, which correctly targets a base stock that covers the pipeline transit time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 and will be observed in the start of P6. Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 414 units in transit (141 from P1, 137 from P2, 136 from P3). Historical demand for the first three periods observed in the conclude messages are 107, 116, and 64. Including the pre-game history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the total observed demand sequence is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64]. The mean demand is approximately 105.5. Since no arrivals have been confirmed yet, L remains at the default (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=8) to capture the variance and ensure we cover the pipeline of L+1=5 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have sold 0 units so far because no stock has arrived yet. The demand history across the last 5 pre-game periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the 4 game periods [107, 116, 64, 92] show a relatively stable mean demand of approximately 104 units per period. Since we have not yet observed a completed delivery cycle to confirm the actual lead time (the first arrival is due this period), I will stick to the promised lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available data points) to capture the current demand mean and variance while smoothing out the dip seen in Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the lead time is exactly 4 periods (W = 5 - 1 = 4). Current on-hand inventory is 53, and we have 418 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). The demand history for the last 5 periods (including pre-game) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the game demand is [107, 116, 64, 92, 88]. The mean demand is approximately 102.4. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full history, as no significant demand regime shift or lead-time deviation is yet confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and observed [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84]) shows high variance but a relatively stable mean around 100. The last three observed demands (92, 88, 84) suggest a slight downward trend compared to the initial spikes, but 6 samples is too few to confirm a regime shift. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 360 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand, and on-hand is 106. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a 5-period horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand history across 12 data points (5 historical + 7 in-game) shows a mean of approximately 101.8. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 88, 84, 93) appears slightly lower and more stable than the long-term average (which included a 138 peak). I will use N=7 for recent demand to capture the in-game behavior while balancing the pre-game history. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With On-hand=149 and In-transit=252 (Total=401), and an expected 5-period demand requirement of ~500-550 units, the system needs to maintain a healthy pipeline. I set L to 4 as it is the confirmed actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Our history confirms the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current inventory is 153 units on-hand with 202 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8). Historical demand across the last 8 periods [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137] averages 96.375 units per period. The recent demand of 137 in P8 is higher than average but not yet a confirmed regime shift. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to reflect the confirmed lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the average demand across the known periods of activity. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, meaning the OR engine will aim to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 482 units) minus pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and the history confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods consistently (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Average demand across all 14 available data points (including pre-game history) is approximately 104.5. Following the lead time formula (L+1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods (approx. 522 units). Current inventory (On-hand: 79 + In-transit: 333 = 412) is slightly below this target. Demand shows no significant regime shift, oscillating between 64 and 138. I will use the 'default' lead time (which is 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 (covering all observed periods in the game) to capture current fluctuations while maintaining stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $462.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10 (all orders from P1 to P6 arrived exactly 4 periods later). History shows a stable demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' with mean demand around 102 units and standard deviation approximately 21. For Period 11, we observe 34 units on-hand and 361 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the last 10 periods of demand data (including pre-game history: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and game history: [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124]) show no significant trend or seasonal shifts, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calibrated to the actual observed demand while maintaining the base lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility but remains within a consistent range (historical mean \u2248 100, last 5 periods mean \u2248 78.4). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (469 units), including an order of 91 units from Period 8 expected to arrive during the current period (Period 12). Since lead time (L=4) has been stable across all observed cycles (Periods 1-7 arrivals), I will use 'calculate' for L. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use a window of recent_N=11 to balance the initial high demand samples with more recent fluctuations while capturing enough variance to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $365.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Historically, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as noted in the carry-over insights and confirmed through the recent conclusion of orders from Period 8 arriving in Period 12). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate fluctuations recently (P8: 137, P9: 78, P10: 124, P11: 58, P12: 92). The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 94.4 units. To ensure the base stock formula correctly accounts for the (L+1) = 5 periods of demand required to cover the period until the next order arrives, I will set L to the promised lead time of 4. Since there isn't a strong signal of a structural regime shift, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the general demand profile while remaining responsive to the observed variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P13). The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with some fluctuations. Recent historical demand (P1-P13): [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92, 104]. The mean demand of all samples is approximately 95.1. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat would calculate (1+L)*mean = 5 * 95.1 = 475.5. Given the high stock-out risk seen in periods like P11 and P12 (ending inventory near 0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand volatility while maintaining a stable average. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 379) plus current On-hand (34) equals 413, which is slightly below the expected 5-period demand (approx 475), suggesting a need for a supportive order. I will stick to 'default' for L as the promised lead time of 4 is currently holding true.

In-transit inventory is 377, which includes orders from Period 11 (136 units), Period 12 (47 units), Period 13 (89 units), and Period 14 (105 units). The demand history shows a mean demand of approximately 97.4 units per period across the last 14 periods. The parameters are set to cover the demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use a recent window (N=10) for demand estimation to capture any recent shifts in variability while maintaining a stable mean. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a slight upward trend in the last few periods (104, 115, 118). Since Period 1, arrivals have consistently followed a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (369 units) accounts for orders placed in Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15, which are expected to arrive in Periods 16 through 19 respectively. With 44 units on-hand and 369 in transit, the current total inventory exposure is 413. Using a lookback period (N=10) for demand captures the recent volume (mean ~102) while filtering out the very low early periods. This choice of parameters (L=4, mu_hat over last 10 periods) provides a base stock level that targets covering demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) while maintaining a buffer for volatility (sigma_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (Period 5 through Period 16), so I will use the 'default' lead time method. Demand has been relatively stable with minor fluctuations. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-16) is approximately 102 units per period. Evaluating recent performance, the last 8 periods (P9-P16) show a similar mean of 99 units. Since there is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift or seasonal spike at Period 17, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the stable long-term mean while allowing for slight variance. Sigma_hat will also be set using 'recent_N' with N=16 to approximate historical volatility. The current inventory position (On-hand: 30, In-transit: 456) will be managed by the OR backend's base-stock calculation to maintain a service level consistent with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant drop in Period 17 (demand=6) compared to the previous average of ~100. However, this single observation is not yet a confirmed regime shift. I will monitor for future low-demand periods. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed through Period 17's conclusion). On-hand inventory is 113, and in-transit inventory is 404, totaling 517 units. This pipeline is expected to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the historical mean of 100/period. To avoid over-ordering based on the single outlier but still accounting for the recent volatility, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent observations while maintaining stability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits significant variance, with a notable drop in Period 17 (demand=6). Recent demand (Periods 14-18) averages approximately 77.4 units. The carry-over insight and history confirm a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 18 saw a demand of 87 and Period 17 was an outlier (6), I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the broader average including the recent volatility, while using a smaller N=5 for sigma_hat to better reflect the increased uncertainty observed in the most recent periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 131 and in-transit is 303. With L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand (approx 500 units); current inventory + pipeline = 434, suggesting the OR engine will place a moderate order to reach the base stock level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant decrease over the last three periods (6, 87, 43) compared to the historical average of around 100. This suggests a potential regime shift or seasonal dip. However, since the evidence is only three periods, I will use a larger window (N=5) to avoid over-reacting to a short-term fluctuation while still capturing the downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 216 and in-transit at 250, we have a total pipeline of 466 units. Given the recent average demand (approx 75 units/period over the last 5 periods), 466 units covers about 6 periods of demand, which is sufficient for transitions. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) will adjust the order downward to account for the current lower demand trend.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 21. History confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 17, there has been a significant decline in demand. The demands for the last four periods are 6, 87, 43, and 82, with a mean of 54.5. This is substantially lower than the previous average (approx. 90-100). The current on-hand inventory (268) plus in-transit (116) totals 384 units, which is very high relative to this new demand level. The OR backend needs to recognize this downward shift to stop over-ordering and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 17: average demand decreased from ~100 to 54.5 (-45%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $550.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history has shown a significant drop starting around Period 17, but Period 21 saw a sharp spike to 171 units. Looking at the last 5 samples [6, 87, 43, 82, 171], the average is approximately 77.8. This suggests the previously identified regime shift down to 54.5 might have been temporary or highly volatile. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is 134 and in-transit is 79 (total pipeline 213). Using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to calculate mu_hat provides a safer buffer for the recent spike while acknowledging the earlier dips. This balances the risk of holding costs (ending inventory is still over 100) against potential lost sales if demand remains high.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly after Period 17: values range from 6 to 171, making mean-based forecasting less stable.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we are managing a demand environment that shifted at Period 17. The demand post-shift (Periods 17-22) is [6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47], averaging 72.7 units per period. This is a 30% drop from the pre-Period 17 average of ~102. Despite the drop, volatility is exceptionally high (std dev ~56), highlighted by the jump to 171 followed by a drop to 47. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods. On-hand is 91 and In-transit is 255 (orders from P19-P22). With 346 units in the pipeline and five periods of demand (72.7 * 5 = 363.5), the inventory position is roughly balanced against the mean, but requires protection against the high variance. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this new regime's mean and volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-106.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase starting from Period 17, with values ranging significantly (6 to 171). The average demand over the last 7 periods (since the shift) is approximately 64, compared to the pre-shift average of ~100. However, the last 4 periods have seen demand values of 82, 171, 47, and 12, showing extreme variance. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met. Current on-hand inventory is 154, and there are 304 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P20, P21, P22, and P23). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the service level target is high (80%). To manage the recent volatility and prevent stockouts during demand spikes (like in P21), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this new, highly variable regime while discounting the older, more stable higher-demand period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 17, and remains volatile with recent demands of 171, 47, 12, and 56. The average demand post-Period 17 is approximately 74.5, compared to the earlier average of ~100. This shift combined with high volatility (swinging from 6 to 171) justifies a more recent focus for forecasting. In Period 24, no shipment arrived, which is expected since the order in Period 20 was 0. However, the pipeline inventory (In-transit) is quite high at 304 units (covering more than 4 periods of average demand). Consequently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this lower but highly variable demand regime since Period 17, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods, which has been consistent throughout history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the new regime (Period 17-24); mean demand has stabilized around ~75 but with significant variance (range 6-171).

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility demand regime that began around Period 17. Since Period 17, demand values have been [6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12, 56, 59], resulting in an average of 62.5 units per period. The recent history shows significant fluctuation (standard deviation ~48). Currently, we have 39 units on-hand and 316 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' total includes orders from P22 (180), P23 (124), and P25 (12). Note that the P20 and P21 orders were 0. The order from P22 (180 units) is expected to arrive in Period 26 (this period's resolution) based on L=4. Since the backend OR engine use \u03bc\u0302 to calculate a base stock and applies a cap based on (1+L), setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (the new regime) ensures the target inventory level reflects the lower average demand (62.5 vs the original ~100) while the sigma_hat captures the increased volatility to maintain the service level. I will use N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the entirety of this lower-mean, high-variance regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 17, with values ranging from 6 to 171. The recent mean (Periods 17-26) is approximately 69.5, significantly lower than the pre-Period 17 average (~103). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 186 units accounts for orders from Period 23 (124 units), Period 25 (12 units), and Period 26 (50 units). Given the high demand variance and the 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety stock to buffer against the high variance while reflecting the overall lower average demand compared to the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17 onwards confirmed: lower mean (~70) but significantly higher volatility (range 6-171), requiring higher safety stock relative to the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 17, moving from a stable mean of ~100 to a highly volatile regime with a lower mean (~70-80) but extreme variance (ranging from 6 to 171). For Period 28, I observe an on-hand inventory of 100 with 216 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current regime (P17-P27) has shown significant demand fluctuations, I will use recent_N with N=11 (covering the entire new regime) to capture both the reduced mean and the increased standard deviation. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the high safety stock required by the extreme volatility observed recently, while avoiding over-ordering based on the higher historical mean from P1-P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand spiked to 157, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The current in-transit inventory is 361 units (orders from P25: 12, P26: 50, P27: 154, P28: 145). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect P25's order (12 units) to arrive in Period 29, and P26's order (50 units) in Period 30. The demand regime from P17 onwards has shown significant volatility (range 6-171) with a rising trend in the last few periods (132, 111, 157). To recover from the stockout and handle this high volatility, I will use recent_N (N=12, covering the high-variance regime since P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a mean demand forecast of ~75/period and captures the substantial standard deviation needed for safety stock during this volatile phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, and while the mean demand in the last 10 periods (P20-P29) is approximately 86, the volatility is very high, ranging from 12 to 171. We have experienced stockouts in Periods 28 and 29 because our previous target levels were insufficient for these high-demand bursts (e.g., 157 and 133). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and 490 in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, P29), we need to ensure the OR backend's target base stock accounts for high volatility. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current mean (~86) and high variance of the more recent regime, rather than the lower mean estimated earlier. This will raise mu_hat and sigma_hat to better protect against the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the primary challenge in the current regime (P17-P29); stockouts in P28-P29 demonstrate that safety stock must be significantly higher to handle spikes > 150 units despite an average demand of ~86.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, and while the mean demand is lower (~80-90), the volatility is extremely high (range 6-171). Currently, the system is struggling with stockouts because recent demand spikes (157 in P28, 133 in P29, 81 in P30) have exhausted on-hand inventory while awaiting the lead-time pipeline. As of Period 31, on-hand inventory is 0. We have 529 units in transit, primarily from large orders placed in Periods 27-30 (154, 145, 141, 89). These are expected to arrive sequentially starting in Period 31 (order from P27). To manage the current high-volatility regime, I will use recent_N (N=14, covering the period since the regime shift at P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the increased variance which is critical for the safety stock calculation to prevent further stockouts during demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17, and while the mean demand is lower than the initial periods, volatility has increased substantially (range 6-171). Specifically, recent demands (P26-P31) have been consistently high: 132, 111, 157, 133, 81, and 163, averaging ~129.5. This is a significant jump from the previous estimate of ~86 recorded in the last carry-over insight. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit units totaling 375, we need to adjust parameters to account for this recent high-demand, high-volatility cluster to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 28-31. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike in both mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: average demand increased from ~86 to ~130 (+51%) with continued high volatility (max 163).

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26, showing an increase in average demand (approx. 110-130) with continued high volatility (values ranging from 33 to 163). In Period 32, demand dropped significantly to 33, but given the history of large spikes (157, 133, 163), we must maintain high coverage. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 112, and in-transit is 410 (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Total pipeline + on-hand is 522 items, which covers roughly 4.7 periods at an average demand of 110. To safeguard against the observed high volatility (sigma), I will use the recent regime (P26-P32, N=7) to set mean and standard deviation, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-228.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, demand remains highly volatile. The recent regime starting at Period 26 shows an average demand of approximately 101 units (averaging P26-P33), though it has fluctuations between 5 and 163. Specifically, the last two periods (P32 and P33) saw very low demand (33 and 5), which contrasts sharply with the spikes seen in P28-P31. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, I need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Although recent demand was low, I must account for the high volatility previously seen in this regime to avoid the stockouts experienced around Period 30. I will use recent_N with N=8 (since Period 26) to capture this regime's mean and standard deviation. The on-hand inventory is currently high (248) due to the recent demand drop and a large arrival, and with 412 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if an additional order is necessary to maintain the service level across the next 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 exhibits high variance (range 5-163) with an average around 101; recent periods 32-33 show a significant temporary dip in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-247.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 26). While recent periods (P32-P34) have seen a significant dip in demand (33, 5, 18), previous periods in this regime reached up to 163 units. With on-hand inventory at 319 and in-transit at 323, we are well-stocked for the immediate future. However, we must ensure the OR backend accounts for the high variance observed since Period 26. I am setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime that started at Period 26 (Periods 26-34). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain a high service level to prevent stockouts seen in P28-P31 while slowly adjusting for the recent low-demand cluster.

Carry-over insight: Demand cluster shift: Periods 32-34 show an average demand of 18.7, a sharp decrease from the Period 26-31 average of 112.8. Volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a significant three-period dip (averaging ~18.7 units), demand spiked back to 144 in Period 35, confirming that the low-demand cluster was temporary and the high-variance regime (Period 26-35) persists. The current average demand in this latest regime (P26-P35) is approximately 97.7 units per period, but with a range of 5 to 163. My strategy is to set parameters that account for this high volatility while recognizing the return to higher demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this specific regime's mean (~97.7). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to capture the high standard deviation observed recently, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 28-31. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed as high-volatility (range 5-163) with a mean of ~98. Periods 32-34 were a temporary low-demand cluster within this regime; Period 35 demand (144) marks a return to the regime's higher range.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is characterized by high volatility (range 5-163) and a mean of approximately 98. Following a temporary dip in Periods 32-34 (average 18.7), demand returned to the higher range in Period 35 (144) and Period 36 (92). I am using recent_N with N=11 to cover this entire volatile regime from Period 26 to the present, which captures both the spikes and the dips to provide a balanced mean and standard deviation. Current on-hand (+263) and in-transit (246) are substantial, which helps mitigate the risk of stockouts given the high variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime established around Period 26. Although the mean demand in this high-volatility regime is approximately 100, recent periods have shown significant fluctuations, including a sharp dip (Periods 32-34) followed by a return to normal levels (Period 35: 144, Period 36: 92, Period 37: 32). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (374 units) due to recent low demand and the arrival of larger orders from Periods 32 and 33. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the distribution characteristic of the current regime (starting Period 26). This allows the OR engine to maintain a higher safety stock to protect against the frequent spikes (>150 units) observed in this regime, while the mu_hat method compensates for the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 5-163) and a mean of ~100. High safety stock is required to prevent stockouts despite high holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (range 5-163) within the regime that started around Period 26. The average demand across the last 13 periods (P26-P38) is approximately 95 units, though recent periods show significant fluctuations (144, 92, 32, 100). The current on-hand inventory (274) plus in-transit stock (193) provides a strong buffer of 467 units. This inventory level is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of average demand, which aligns with the (L+1) lead time of 5. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a safety stock that handles peaks around 150-160 units. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this high-volatility regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-124.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (range 5-163) since Period 26. In the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the mean demand is approximately 69.8, but this includes a very low cluster (Periods 32-34 and 37-39). The most recent demand (P39) was 30, following 100 in P38. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the target service level is 80%. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (244) and significant in-transit units (291), the pipeline is currently well-stocked to handle the high variance. I will use a recent_N (N=14, covering the start of the current high-volatility regime at P26) to capture the long-term average and variance of this regime, ensuring enough safety stock to cover the periodic spikes above 140 units while acknowledging the current high on-hand position will naturally limit new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme within the regime starting Period 26 (range 5-163); while mean demand over the last 10 periods is ~70, safety stock must account for spikes >140 units observed as recently as Period 35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that began around Period 26. The most recent demand was 139, which is significantly above the recent 10-period average of ~70, confirming the need for robust safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. On-hand inventory is 208, with 197 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). To set OR parameters, I utilize 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 (covering the regime since Period 26) to capture the current mean while allowing for the observed volatility. For sigma_hat, I also use 'recent_N' with N=15 to reflect the high variance (range 5-163) seen in this regime. This ensures the OR backend maintains a high enough base stock to handle demand spikes while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit margin (80% critical ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is characterized by persistent extreme volatility (range 5-163). In the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 69.3 units, but the high variance remains the primary driver for stock safety. The current inventory status shows On-hand at 203 and In-transit at 268 (totaling 471), which provides significant coverage relative to the recent average demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) vs low holding cost ($1), a high service level is naturally favored by the OR backend. However, to avoid overstocking in a lower-mean period while still protecting against spikes like the 139 observed in P40, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (recent_N=10) to capture the current lower mean cluster without discounting the volatility seen in this window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the current regime (starting Period 26). While the mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 85.3, the range is wide (30-144). The current on-hand inventory is 133, and there are 262 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in Periods 39 (98 units), 40 (9 units), and 41 (155 units) over the next few periods. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, the target service level is 80%. Given the high volatility and recent demand spikes, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the entire stable-yet-volatile period since Period 26) to capture the trend while maintaining enough safety stock to account for the frequent large demand swings seen throughout the history. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time has remained consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting around Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 5-163) with a mean currently trending around 75-80 over the last 15 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 171 units, with 318 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P40 (9 units), P41 (155 units), P42 (0 units), and P43 (154 units) over the next four periods. To manage the extreme volatility while balancing the $1.00 holding cost against the $4.00 profit (suggesting an 80% service level), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility. Specifically, N=15 covers the activity since the stabilization observed after Period 26, capturing the high-variance behavior while filtering out the older, lower-volatility regime. This approach provides sufficient safety stock to buffer against spikes (like the 139 in P40) while preventing excessive accumulation during the low-demand dips.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 5-163) with a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units (calculated from Period 26 to Period 44). The last 10 periods (P35-P44) show an average demand of 88.8 units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the system should aim for a high service level. However, extreme spikes (e.g., 144, 139, 126) require significant safety stock. I will use a recent_N of 19 (the length of the current high-volatility regime starting at Period 26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this variance while smoothing out the recent fluctuations. Current on-hand (54) plus in-transit (313) is 367, which covers roughly 4 periods of average demand (~92.5 * 4 = 370). Ordering parameters will be set to maintain this buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile with a current mean around 83 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), ranging from 30 to 139. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed. At the start of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 137 units and in-transit is 331 units (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45). Note that the order from P42 (0 units) and P44 (4 units) are part of this pipeline. Total pipeline + on-hand = 468 units. Given the high volatility observed in this regime (sigma is significant), I will use the last 10 periods to capture the current mean and variance. This 'recent_N' approach for N=10 balances the need to respond to the stabilized lower mean compared to earlier peaks, while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the frequent spikes above 120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime established around Period 26. In the most recent periods (P41-P46), demand values were 89, 76, 60, 126, 72, and 18, resulting in a 6-period average of approximately 73.5. While this is lower than the long-term regime average of ~100, the extreme variance (range 18-126 in these 6 periods, and up to 163 in the full regime) necessitates maintaining a robust safety stock. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 119 and in-transit is 339, totaling 458 units. To balance the risk of stockouts during high demand spikes against holding costs ($1/unit), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 20 periods to capture the regime's behavior, and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (N=20). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the significant demand swings seen in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-153.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 5-163). Recent demand (Periods 44-47) has been 126, 72, 18, and 24, showing a significant drop compared to the long-term mean of ~100. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 73.4. Given the extreme variance, I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture this lower mean while maintaining a default sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock against historical spikes (>140). On-hand inventory (249) plus in-transit (241, with Period 45 order of 173 still pending) is adequate for the end-of-game approach (Period 48/50). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for Periods 38-47 has decreased to ~73, though volatility remains high with a lower bound near 5 units.

Daily Profit: $768.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $707.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the demand context is dominated by extreme volatility within a regime that stabilized after Period 26. While the mean demand for the last 10 periods (P39-P48) is approximately 79.5 units, recent individual demands have fluctuated wildly, most notably a spike to 192 in Period 48\u2014the highest demand recorded in the entire history. This confirms that while the 'average' fluctuates, the tail risk is significant. On-hand inventory is 61, and we have 237 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (implying a target service level of 80%), our parameters must account for these extreme spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (covering Period 38 onwards) to capture the current mean of ~89.7, which aligns with recent trends. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the high standard deviation (~57) observed in this volatile regime, ensuring the safety stock adequately protects against surges like the 192 units seen in Period 48.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 48 (192 units), confirming that even within a lower-mean regime (~80-90), extreme spikes significantly exceeding historical maximums are possible.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing a high-volatility environment for chips(Regular). The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 48-49) has surged significantly (192, 182 units) compared to the previous 10-period average (~73), indicating a potential new upward shift or extreme volatility cluster. With On-hand inventory at 52 units and a total of 236 units in-transit (orders from P46-P49), we are at risk if this high demand persists. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy. To cover the lead-time demand (L+1 = 5 periods) against these massive spikes, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the recent spike and the periods immediately preceding it) to capture the trend change without over-correcting to the extreme 180+ values as a permanent mean. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the broad volatility (range 18 to 192) observed recently, ensuring the OR engine calculates a sufficient safety stock to buffer against these high-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike confirmed at Period 48: Demand jumped from a 10-period average of ~73 to 187 (avg of P48-P49), representing a +156% increase. Volatility remains extremely high.
