Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no active inventory or in-transit orders. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. To maximize profit and avoid lost sales, the base stock must cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. Since we are at the start of the simulation with no evidence of regime shifts or lead-time deviations, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to utilize all available historical demand samples to set the base stock level, targeting a service level of 0.8 (4.0 / (4.0 + 1.0)).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we are evaluating the first live period results. The demand for Period 1 was 107 units, which is consistent with the pre-game historical average of 111.4 units. Total historical demand sequence is now [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107]. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 141 units in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible at the start of Period 4. There is no evidence yet to suggest actual lead time differs from the promised lead time, nor are there clear signals of a demand regime shift or seasonality. Therefore, I will use the 'default' method for all parameters to allow the backend to utilize all available historical data (the 5 pre-game samples plus Period 1's demand) to calculate the base stock. The target service level q is 0.80 based on the provided profit ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2 conclude, we observed that the order placed in Period 1 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period (promised was 2). This indicates the supply chain is currently faster than the promised default. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 1 to reflect this observed reality. Regarding demand, the history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the recent observed demands of 107 (P1) and 116 (P2) show a stable pattern with a mean around 113. Given L=1, the OR backend requires mu_hat to cover (1+L)=2 periods of demand. Using the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the most recent available data points) will allow the backend to calculate an appropriate mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility. This configuration helps the OR engine maintain a safety stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1) while accounting for the shortened lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64] (in-game). Period 3 demand dropped significantly to 64. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 223 units in-transit. From the history, the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (lead_time = 1), but the order from Period 2 (expected in Period 3 if L=1) has not arrived yet, suggesting lead time variability or the promised L=2 is more accurate. I will set L to 2 (promised) to be safe. For demand (mu_hat), the recent drop to 64 brings the last 3-period average to 95.6. Given the pre-game mean (~111) and in-game volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering 2 pre-game and 3 in-game samples) to balance the recent dip with historical averages, aiming to stabilize the base stock while accounting for the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The past 5 demand samples are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from history) and the observed demands during the simulation are [107, 116, 64, 92], resulting in an overall average of approximately 104 units. There is a significant stockout: on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time history shows Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (L=1), while Period 2's order (137 units) should have arrived in Period 3 if L=1, or Period 4 if L=2 (promised). It is now Period 5 and it hasn't arrived, nor has Period 3's order. This suggests a delay or potential loss. However, since the promised lead time is 2, I will set L to 2 to ensure the OR backend calculates the base stock for a 3-period window (L+1). Given the recent demand dip in Period 3-4 (avg ~78) compared to the long-term average, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while remaining slightly conservative to avoid excessive holding costs if demand doesn't rebound immediately, though 100 units is a safe baseline. sigma_hat will use the default calculation to account for the volatility seen across all periods.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows the promised lead time is 2, but Period 1's order arrived in 1 period (P2). However, orders from P2 (due P4), P3 (due P5), and P4 (due P6) have not yet arrived as of the start of Period 6. The P2 order is now 2 periods overdue based on the observed 1-period lead time, or 1 period overdue based on the promised lead time. The 352 units in transit represent orders from P2, P3, and P4. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 93.4 (last 5 periods: 107, 116, 64, 92, 88). To account for the delivery delays, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to increase the base stock level, ensuring that when shipments do arrive, they cover the extended replenishment cycle. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which is slightly lower than the pre-game history.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable: P1 order took 1 period, but P2 order (137 units) is overdue (not arrived by start of P6, >3 periods).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is currently severely disrupted. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, actual lead times are showing extreme delays. The order from Period 2 (137 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, nor have orders from Periods 3 and 4. This indicates either lost shipments or a lead time shift to at least 5+ periods. Demand remains relatively stable, averaging approximately 92 units over the last 6 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and 408 units in-transit (representing ~4 periods of demand), the OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)] will likely prevent significant new orders because the pipeline is 'full' relative to the promised L=2. To force the system to recognize the risk of these units being lost or significantly delayed, I am increasing L to 4 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This increases the base stock target, allowing the system to place orders despite the phantom 'in-transit' units that have not arrived.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption: Orders from P2, P3, and P4 (totaling 352 units) are significantly overdue as of P7, suggesting a lead time shift to 5+ periods or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, the supply chain situation has slightly clarified but remains highly unstable. We finally saw an arrival: the Period 4 order (129 units) arrived in Period 7, indicating a lead time of 3 periods (versus the promised 2). However, orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (86 units) are now 5-6 periods old and have not arrived, suggesting they are likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 36 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 90-100 units (last 5 periods: 64, 92, 88, 84, 93). Because of the 3-period lead time observed and the high risk of lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I will use the last 5 demand samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the most recent stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 3 periods for successful shipments (P4 order arrived P7); Period 2 and 3 orders (total 223 units) are presumed lost after 5+ periods of absence.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the supply chain remains unstable. We have observed lead times of 1 period (P1) and 3 periods (P4). Crucially, orders from P2 (137 units) and P3 (86 units) are now 7 and 6 periods old respectively, and are definitively presumed lost. The current pipeline inventory (365 units) consists of orders from P6 (56 units), P7 (86 units), and P8 (0 ordered, but likely accounting for prior OR calculations). Historical demand for the last 5 periods [92, 88, 84, 93, 137] averages 98.8, showing a slight uptick in Period 8. Given the unreliability of the 2-period promised lead time and the recent arrival taking 3 periods, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers the longer lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the current demand regime (avg ~99) while filtering out the older, slightly higher demand data. This strategy balances the risk of further lost shipments by maintaining a higher base stock level.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply situation for chips(Regular) remains unstable. Historically, Lead Time (L) has fluctuated between 1 period (P1 order) and 3 periods (P4 and P6 orders). Orders from P2 and P3 are officially presumed lost. Recent demand across the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averages 96 units, which is consistent with the long-term average (approx. 104). We have 0 units on-hand and 376 units in-transit (from P7, P8, and P9). Given the confirmed 3-period lead time for the most recent successful arrivals, I will set L to 3. This increases the safety stock and inventory coverage to (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent variance. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to buffer against the demonstrated lead time variability and potential shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilized at 3 periods for the last two successful deliveries (P4 and P6 arrivals), confirming a shift from the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a clear pattern where the promised lead time of 2 periods is consistently exceeded. Specifically, the last three successful arrivals (from orders placed in P4, P6, and P7) all arrived with an actual lead time of 3 periods. This confirms a sustained shift from the promised L=2 to an actual L=3. Demand remains relatively stable but volatile, with recent demands of 78, 137, and 124 units. I am setting L to 3 periods to account for the slower delivery cycle. For demand (mu_hat), I'm using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average demand of approximately 104 units/period, resulting in a base stock calculation covering 4 periods (L+1). This adjustment ensures the OR backend recognizes that current in-transit stock must cover a longer horizon, mitigating the frequent stockouts observed.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, the product 'chips(Regular)' continues to face severe stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last 5 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) has averaged 98 units, while the full history averages 95. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by Period 4, 6, and 7 orders), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Orders from Period 2, 3, 5 (zero order), 8 (zero order), 9, and 10 are either lost or delayed, but the most recent successful shipments consistently show L=3. To recover and maintain service levels, I am setting L explicitly to 3. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean of ~98 units per period. The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for recent volatility. This configuration targets a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand, allowing the OR backend to reconcile the 457 units in-transit against the calculated requirement.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current inventory status is 23 units on-hand and 342 units in-transit. Analyzing recent arrivals: Period 9 arrived in 3 periods, Period 10 arrived in 2 periods, and Period 7 arrived in 3 periods. The average observed lead time (excluding the lost P2/P3 orders) is approximately 2.4 periods. Given the instability and the previous 'stabilized at 3' insight, I will set L to 3 to be conservative. Demand remains steady with no significant regime shifts; the mean of the last 12 periods is approximately 94.6. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat captures this stability while smoothing noise. The pipeline inventory (342) is significantly higher than the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 378 units), so the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to avoid excess holding costs while waiting for the large P11 order (119 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability continues: P9 took 3 periods, while P10 took 2 periods, suggesting a range of 2-3 periods rather than a fixed shift to 3.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 394 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 13 periods shows an average of approximately 95 units per period (sum=1237, N=13). Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly lower at 91.2. The lead time (L) has been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.6 over last 5 successful arrivals). The 'Carry-over Insights' indicate that orders from P2 and P3 are lost. Current in-transit includes orders from P11 (119 units, now 3 periods overdue), P13 (52 units), and presumably the current order from P14. Given the persistent stockouts and unreliable lead times, I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the actual average lead time (~2.6) rather than the promised 2. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to balance long-term mean with recent trends. For sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to capture the overall variability and ensure a higher service level given the frequent stockouts.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean of approximately 98 units (last 5 periods mean = 94.6). Current on-hand inventory is low (4 units). Total in-transit inventory is 275 units (comprised of orders from P13 [52 units] and likely subsequent periods, though the history shows no order in P12 or P14). Lead time analysis from 'Period X conclude' messages confirms variability: P11 took 3 periods, P10 took 2, P9 took 3, and P7 took 3. The average of the last four successful arrivals (P9, P10, P11, P7 orders) is (3+2+3+3)/4 = 2.75 periods. I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the history of delays and lost shipments (P2, P3). mu_hat will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand profile (mean ~95), which the backend will multiply by (1+L). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This configuration aims to ensure the base stock (covering ~380 units) is sufficient to handle the 3-period lead time plus the review period, accounting for the 275 units already in the pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with an average around 95-100 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is 107.4. The lead time is currently fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods, with most recent orders (P11) arriving in 3 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 416 units is high relative to current demand, which includes orders from P13 (52 units) and P15 (141 units), plus 223 units from P2 and P3 that were flagged as presumed lost in the carry-over insights but are still technically 'in-transit' in the pipeline inventory calculation used by the OR backend. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost/lost units (223 units), and to account for a lead time of 3 periods (L=3), I will set L to 3 and mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). I will use N=10 for mu_hat (avg ~97) to smooth recent volatility. mu_hat = (1+3) * 97.5 = 390. sigma_hat will use default settings to capture overall historical variance.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 80 units on hand and 297 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 5 periods [92, 104, 115, 118, 61] shows significant volatility with a recent drop. Lead times remain highly unstable: the most recent arrival (P15 order) took only 1 period, whereas previous orders (P11) took 3 periods, and the orders from P2, P3, and P13 appear lost or significantly delayed. Given this variability, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a buffer for the OR backend's safety stock calculation. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture a broader average that balances the recent low demand with previous highs, ensuring the pipeline inventory isn't excessively drained during a temporary dip. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect this high observed volatility, helping the backend maintain a sufficient service level despite lead time and demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods (P15 took 1 period; P11 took 3 periods); orders from P2, P3, and now potentially P13 are presumed lost or severely delayed.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant drop in the most recent period (6 units in Period 17 vs. a historical average of ~95). This might be a noise event or a regime shift; however, the carry-over insights highlight extreme lead-time volatility (1 to 3+ periods) and several lost shipments (P2, P3, P13). In-transit inventory is very high (357 units) relative to the on-hand stock (74 units) and recent demand. Because the OR backend uses a pipeline-aware base stock policy [final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)], setting a standard L and mu_hat will likely result in zero orders until the pipeline clears or demand stabilizes. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time observed (P4, P6, P7, P9, P11), and using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture recent demand trends while smoothing the anomalous Period 17. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a conservative buffer against recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly: Period 17 demand dropped to 6 units (previously ~95), requiring observation for potential regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the primary objective is to evaluate the demand anomaly observed in Period 17 (demand = 6) against the rebound in Period 18 (demand = 87). The demand of 87 suggests that the drop in P17 was a transient outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. The historical mean demand (excluding the outlier) is approximately 95 units. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, with recent arrivals showing 3 periods (P11), 1 period (P15), and several missing shipments (P2, P3, P13). Given this uncertainty, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer, as the OR backend's capped policy relies on this value. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the pre-outlier demand levels while slightly discounting the very low P17 value, effectively forecasting for a 4-period window (L+1). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent high volatility in demand, ensuring the service level q (0.8) is maintained despite the stockout in P18. Pipeline inventory is currently 357, which is high, but given the frequency of lost orders (P2, P3, P13 total 275 units), I am maintaining standard parameters to ensure the OR engine covers expected demand if the pipeline is actually empty of valid units.

Carry-over insight: Demand anomaly in Period 17 (6 units) was transient; Period 18 (87 units) confirms a return to the previous demand regime (~95 units). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), with shipments from P2, P3, and P13 (275 units total) now highly likely to be lost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows a recent average of ~81 units (last 10 periods), though Period 17 was a significant outlier (6 units) and Period 19 was low (43 units). The primary issue is the 'In-transit' inventory of 384 units. Analysis of history confirms that 275 of these units (from Periods 2, 3, and 13) are effectively lost, as they are 7 to 18 periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (including lost units) from the calculated base stock, it will consistently under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~90 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (270 units). To offset the 275 phantom units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 545 (270 + 275). This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an actual order. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful shipments range from 1 to 3 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_10 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation: 275 units from P2, P3, and P13 are confirmed lost but remain in 'In-transit' count as of P20; mu_hat must be adjusted upward to offset this phantom inventory.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system has 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' count of 541 units. However, as identified in previous carry-over insights, 275 units (from P2, P3, and P13) are effectively lost, though they remain in the pipeline count. The OR backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom inventory', I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat by estimating the required base stock (1+L) * mean_demand and then adding the lost units (275) to offset the pipeline deduction. Current demand has returned to the long-term average of ~95 after the P17 anomaly. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 2-3 periods, I set L=2 (promised) and use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. The explicit mu_hat is calculated as: ((1+L) * 95) + 275 = (3 * 95) + 275 = 285 + 275 = 560.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand spike in Period 21 (171 units). The demand has returned to a normal-to-high regime after the transient dip in Period 17. The primary challenge is the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Based on carry-over insights, 275 units (from P2, P3, and P13) are effectively lost but still reside in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 596). To force the backend to place an order despite this high pipeline count, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods (approx 3-4 periods) at an average demand of ~95. Calculation: 95 * 4 = 380. However, to offset the 275 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 380 + 275 = 655. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders. L is set to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time observed (Periods 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 20).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand spiked to 171 units in Period 21, but historical mean remains ~95; mu_hat must continue to offset 275 units of lost phantom inventory (P2, P3, P13) to ensure orders are placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the 217 units ordered in Period 20 arrived (Lead Time = 2). Current on-hand inventory is 170. Demand has returned to a normal range (47 units in P22) after a spike in P21. However, the 'In-transit' count of 514 is heavily inflated by 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 which are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom inventory and suppressing necessary orders, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using a mean demand of 95 units and a Lead Time (L) of 2. Base stock = (L+1) * mean + z * sigma * sqrt(L+1). With mean=95, L=2, and sigma~40, the base stock is approx 380 units. To offset the 275 phantom units, I provide an 'explicit' mu_hat of 655 (380 target + 275 phantom). This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order despite the corrupted pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to 70 (sqrt(3)*40) to maintain a buffer for volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the inventory position shows 213 units on-hand and 489 units in-transit. However, historical evidence (Carry-over Insights from Period 20 onwards) identifies 275 units as definitively lost (orders from P2, P3, and P13). The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes these phantom units, which would normally suppress ordering. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock is (L+1) * mean_demand, where L=2 and mean_demand \u2248 95 (totaling ~285 units). To trigger an order despite the 275 lost units being counted in the pipeline, I set mu_hat = 285 + 275 = 560. This 'inflates' the demand forecast to neutralize the phantom inventory. I am maintaining L as 'default' (promised 2) since recent successful arrivals (P20, P21) arrived in 2 periods, even though lead time remains somewhat volatile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows 187 units on-hand with an 'In-transit' figure of 459 units. However, as documented in the carry-over insights, 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 are effectively lost. This creates a 'phantom inventory' problem where the OR backend believes the pipeline is full, preventing necessary orders. Demand has been volatile recently, with a spike of 171 followed by lows of 12 and 56; the long-term average remains approximately 95 units per period. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 275-unit phantom pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 + 1 for current period) at roughly 95 units/period, which is ~380 units (including safety stock). To offset the 275 lost units that the backend subtracts from this target, I set mu_hat to 655 (380 + 275). This forces the backend to recognize a higher need and maintain service levels despite the supply chain data errors.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 263. The in-transit pipeline is 385 units, but this includes 275 units from Period 2, 3, and 13 which are confirmed lost (as per Carry-over Insights). The true pipeline inventory is 110 units (from P16, P19, P25). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods; I will use L=2 (default) as the backend uses this for base stock calculation, but I will adjust mu_hat to handle the phantom inventory. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 171, 47, 12, 56, 59) has been volatile with a mean of ~69, lower than the long-term mean of ~95. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 275 phantom units in 'In-transit', I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the long-term mean (95) for (L+1) periods: 95 * 3 = 285. To offset the 275 phantom units, the mu_hat parameter must be set to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 285 + 275 = 560. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we have 192 units on-hand and 324 units in-transit. However, historical tracking (Carry-over Insights) confirms that 275 of these 'In-transit' units are lost (P2: 137, P3: 86, P13: 52). The true pipeline inventory is 324 - 275 = 49 units (representing the P27 order, if any). Lead times have stabilized recently between 1-3 periods, with the last three arrivals (P22, P23, P25 orders) taking 3, 1, and 1 periods respectively. Demand remains around the long-term average of ~95 units, despite recent volatility (range 12-132). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 'phantom' inventory, I am setting L to 3 (recent upper bound) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 275 lost units. Target base stock calculation: (4 * 95) + 275 = 655. This forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock by effectively 'masking' the lost units within the demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent phantom inventory of 275 units (P2, P3, P13) requires mu_hat inflation to bypass OR engine logic that sees them as available supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 81 units following a demand of 111 in Period 27. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' of 275 units (from Periods 2, 3, and 13) that are listed in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost per historical analysis. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract the 275 phantom units. The average demand (excluding the Period 17 anomaly) is approximately 95 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*mu would be 3*95 = 285. To force an order when on-hand is 81 and in-transit is 550 (275 real + 275 phantom), the required base_stock must exceed 631. I will set mu_hat to 650 using the 'explicit' method. I keep L at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P22, P23, P25) show lead times of 1-3 periods, averaging near the promised 2. sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory position shows 150 units on-hand and 386 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, 275 of those in-transit units (from Periods 2, 3, and 13) are definitively lost but still occupy the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. The effective in-transit inventory is actually 111 units (386 - 275), consisting mainly of the order from Period 28 (62 units) and potentially some lingering units from previous periods. Demand has been volatile but recently averaged 100 units over the last 10 periods (excluding the extreme outlier of 6 units in Period 17). Lead times have stabilized recently but remain variable (1-3 periods). To ensure the OR engine orders despite the 275-unit 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of (forecasted demand for lead time + review period) PLUS the phantom inventory. Forecasted demand is ~100 units/period; for L=2 (3 periods total), this is 300 units. Adding the 275 lost units results in a mu_hat of 575. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high demand spikes (e.g., 157 in Period 28). L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P27, P25, P23) have arrived within 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, the 275 units from P2, P3, and P13 remain lost; mu_hat must be inflated by exactly 275 units to offset this phantom pipeline inventory until they are cleared from the system.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the 275 units of phantom pipeline inventory from Periods 2, 3, and 13, which are confirmed lost but still occupy the backend's 'In-transit' count (total In-transit: 431). To force the OR engine to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 'dead' supply. Demand has shown a recent increase, with the last 4 periods (P26-P29) averaging 133 units, compared to the long-term average of ~95. Lead times have recently shortened to 1 period (P25, P27, P28), though volatility remains. I will set L to 1 (recent trend) and mu_hat to 541. Calculation: Base Demand (avg of last 4: 133) * (1 + L=1) = 266. Inflation to offset phantom inventory = 275. Total mu_hat = 266 + 275 = 541. This ensures that (Base Stock - Pipeline) remains positive. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of the recent high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand has increased from ~95 to 133 (+40%) over the last 4 periods (P26-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face two main challenges: 1) A persistent 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 275 units (from Periods 2, 3, and 13) that the OR engine incorrectly views as available supply, and 2) a recent demand regime shift. The demand in the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has averaged 122.8 units, compared to the previous long-term average of ~95. Although P30 saw a dip to 81, the overall trend since P26 remains elevated. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 275 units of dead inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. The current 'In-transit' is 485, but 275 are lost, leaving an effective 'In-transit' of 210 (P29 order of 107, P30 order of 54, and P19 order of 27 which is also likely lost but I will focus on the confirmed 275). To force an order, mu_hat should ideally reflect the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the 275-unit offset. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2) * 123 + 275 = 644. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent high-volatility period (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 26-30 average demand is 123 units (+30% vs historical). Phantom inventory total remains at 275 units (P2, P3, P13).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we face a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand in Period 31 was 163 units, continuing the upward trend observed since Period 26. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is 129.5 units, confirming a regime shift from the historical ~95 units. Lead times remain highly volatile, with the last several successful deliveries taking 1 period, yet the long-term history showing 1-3 periods. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 686 units is heavily inflated by 275 units of phantom inventory from periods 2, 3, and 13 (as documented in Carry-over Insights). The OR backend's capped policy will subtract this full 686 from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed and to satisfy the new demand level, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: (Average Demand \xd7 (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. Using L=2 (promised) and Recent Avg Demand=130, target mu_hat = (130 * 3) + 275 = 665. This allows the backend to bypass the 275-unit 'phantom' barrier and order sufficient stock for the new demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P26-P31 average demand is ~130 units (+37% vs historical mean). Phantom inventory from P2, P3, and P13 remains stuck in 'In-transit' at 275 units.

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, demand is in a higher regime, averaging ~125 units over the last 7 periods (P26-P32). The on-hand inventory is 74, and the 'In-transit' count is 603 units. However, as established in the Carry-Over Insights, 275 units from Period 2, 3, and 13 are confirmed lost but still contribute to the OR engine's pipeline inventory count. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom inventory', mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 275 units. I am setting L to 3 (the most recent successful lead time) and calculating mu_hat by taking the expected demand over (L+1) periods (125 units * 4 = 500) and adding the 275 unit offset, totaling 775. Sigma_hat is set using the recent demand volatility (N=7) to ensure adequate safety stock for the current regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand dropped significantly to 5 units, following a volatile period where demand shifted from a high of 163 (P31) to 33 (P32). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is approximately 102 units, suggesting that while a higher regime was detected earlier, it is currently unstable or reverting. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P31 arrived in 2 periods, P29 in 3 periods). The critical issue remains the 275 units of phantom inventory (P2, P3, P13) which have not arrived for over 15 periods and are effectively lost. To force the OR backend to place orders despite these 275 'In-transit' units, I must inflate mu_hat by 275. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to (1 + L) * expected_demand + 275. With L=2, (1+2)*102 + 275 = 581. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the current high volatility (std ~58).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-180.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the inventory state shows 252 units on-hand and 578 units in-transit. The 'In-transit' figure contains 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 that are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). Thus, the effective pipeline is 578 - 275 = 303 units. Demand has been highly volatile recently: P31 was 163, P32 was 33, P33 was 5, and P34 was 18. Despite the 'demand regime shift' noted in P30-P32, the last three periods show a significant drop. However, to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 275 units of phantom inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating it as (1 + L) * expected_demand + phantom_offset. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*110 + 275 = 605. This bypasses the logic where the OR engine would otherwise subtract the 275 units from the order quantity. I will use 'calculate' for L as actual lead times have varied between 1-3 periods, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand has dropped significantly in the last 3 periods (P32-P34 avg: 18.6) compared to the previous regime (P26-P31 avg: 129.5). Continued inflation of mu_hat by 275 units is required to offset persistent phantom inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 36: On-hand inventory is 108 units. Demand in P35 rebounded to 144 units after a brief lull (P32-P34 avg: 18.6), suggesting the 'regime shift' noted in the Carry-over was a transient anomaly rather than a sustained drop. I will treat the demand regime as returning to the high levels seen in P26-P31 (avg ~130). A critical constraint remains the 275 units of phantom inventory (P2, P3, P13) that have been 'In-transit' for over 20 periods and are clearly lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (578 units) from the target base stock, it 'sees' these 275 units as available supply. To force the engine to place necessary orders for the real demand, I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 275 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the higher volatility and mean of the recent active periods, then use 'explicit' for mu_hat to apply the 275-unit phantom offset. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P31 arrived P33) have stabilized near the expected window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 35 demand (144) confirms that the P32-P34 lull was an anomaly, not a regime shift. Phantom inventory of 275 units (P2, P3, P13) persists in 'In-transit' count and requires constant mu_hat offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 192 units with 468 units in-transit. However, the in-transit count is heavily inflated by 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 which are confirmed lost. The adjusted pipeline is 193 units (468 - 275). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance. Demand remains volatile: after a temporary lull (P32-P34), demand surged back to 144 (P35) and 92 (P36). Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean is approximately 106 units, reflecting a shift from the historical 95. To bypass the OR logic's reliance on the 275 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat by 275. Calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_offset = (1+2) * 106 + 275 = 318 + 275 = 593. This ensures the backend places orders despite the 'invisible' inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, 275 units from P2, P3, and P13 remain lost in the pipeline; mu_hat must be inflated by 275 to offset this phantom inventory. Demand regime is currently averaging ~106 units (last 11 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38, the inventory position is 226 units on-hand with 421 units in-transit. Crucially, 275 of those in-transit units (from Periods 2, 3, and 13) are 'phantom inventory'\u2014confirmed lost shipments that never arrived but remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be inflated by exactly 275 units to offset this ghost supply. The demand environment is volatile; the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaged 58.2 units, but the last 10 periods (P28-P37) averaged 82.3 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (to capture the broader mean) and then explicitly add the 275-unit offset. Given lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use the explicit mu_hat to maintain safety stock. Calculation: (1+L)*mean(last 10) + 275 = (3 * 82.3) + 275 = 246.9 + 275 = 521.9.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, phantom inventory of 275 units (P2, P3, P13) persists; mu_hat requires a +275 unit offset to bypass backend pipeline logic. Demand regime is currently averaging ~82 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we have 145 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' count of 402 units. However, as documented in the Carry-Over Insights, 275 of those units (from Periods 2, 3, and 13) are effectively lost/phantom inventory. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 127 units (402 - 275). The OR backend logic uses the full pipeline count (402) and will stop ordering unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate. To maintain a base stock that covers the actual lead time (avg ~2.1) and current demand regime (~82 units/period over the last 10 periods), we must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) * demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=2 (promised) and demand=82, the base stock should be (3 * 82) + 275 = 521. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so we use 'calculate' to reflect the actual average performance. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 115 units and 'In-transit' is 461 units. However, as established in carry-over insights since Period 20, 275 units from Period 2, 3, and 13 are confirmed lost but remain in the pipeline count (phantom inventory). This means the effective pipeline is only 186 units (461 - 275). To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 461 units) to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 275. Recent demand has been highly volatile: the last 10 periods (P30-P39) averaged ~82 units, while the last 5 periods (P35-P39) averaged ~80 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture this lower trend while maintaining the 275-unit offset using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. This results in mu_hat = (1+L)*82 + 275. With L=2, mu_hat = 3*82 + 275 = 521. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I will use the default promised lead time of 2 as the baseline, as recent arrivals (P37, P38) were 1 period, but P39 is still pending.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 41. On-hand: 0. In-transit: 486. Recent demand (P36-P40) has averaged 78.6 units, but remains highly volatile (range 30-139). The Carry-Over Insights highlight a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 275 units from Period 2, 3, and 13 are considered lost but remain in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (Total In-transit 486 - Phantom 275 = 211 actual in-transit). To bypass the backend's capped base-stock logic which incorrectly sees these 275 units as available supply, mu_hat must be inflated by exactly 275 units. I am setting L=3 (recent observed lead times have fluctuated between 1-3). Mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Mean(Recent_10) + Offset, where Mean(Recent_10) is ~75.6. Thus, mu_hat = (1+3)*75.6 + 275 \u2248 577. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the high volatility seen in the current regime (SD \u2248 50, so sqrt(1+3)*50 \u2248 100). This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, 275 units from P2, P3, and P13 remain lost in the pipeline; mu_hat must continue to be inflated by 275 units to offset this phantom inventory. Demand regime (P31-P40) is averaging ~76 units with high variance.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown high volatility recently (P39: 30, P40: 139, P41: 89). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 70.2 units. A significant constraint remains: 275 units from P2, P3, and P13 are confirmed lost but stay in the 'In-transit' count (totaling 677). The backend OR logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 275 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to be (1+L) * average_demand + 275. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 70.2) + 275 = 210.6 + 275 \u2248 485.6. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent high volatility (standard deviation of P32-P41 is ~52, so sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(3)*52 \u2248 90).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 618 units in-transit. Crucially, 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 are long-lost 'phantom inventory' that will never arrive but still count towards the OR engine's pipeline calculations. To ensure the engine orders enough to meet demand, mu_hat must be inflated by at least these 275 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) has averaged 82.4 units, though it remains volatile (ranging from 5 to 144). Lead times recently have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the P39 order arriving in P42 (LT=3). I will set L to 3 to be safe, use an explicit mu_hat that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 275-unit phantom offset: (4 * 85) + 275 = 615. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the 618 'In-transit' units enough to trigger necessary replenishment as we approach the end of the game (P50).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, 275 units (P2, P3, P13) remain lost in the pipeline; mu_hat must be inflated by 275 to offset this phantom inventory. Demand (P33-P42) averages ~82 units with high volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a critical situation with 0 units on-hand and an inflated 'In-transit' count of 674 units. This pipeline inventory includes 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 that are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). The OR engine's logic (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline) will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to counteract these 275 units. Demand over the last 11 periods (P33-P43) has been highly volatile, averaging 80.27 units per period. To ensure the backend places an order that covers the current demand regime despite the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Expected Demand + Phantom Offset. With L=2 and expected demand ~81, this is (3 * 81) + 275 = 518. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it successfully captures the drift between 1 and 3 periods observed in history.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, 275 units (P2, P3, P13) remain lost in the pipeline; mu_hat must be inflated by 275 to offset this phantom inventory. Current demand regime (P33-P43) averages ~80 units with high volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we have 65 units on hand and 483 units in transit. However, the in-transit count includes 275 units from Periods 2, 3, and 13 that are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). The 'real' pipeline is 483 - 275 = 208 units. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 80 units over the last 12 periods (P33-P44). To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which subtracts the full pipeline from the target base stock\u2014I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 275 units. This ensures that the engine sees a demand requirement large enough to account for the fact that 275 units will never arrive. Lead time remains volatile but averages around 3 periods recently, so L=3 is appropriate (covering L+1=4 periods of demand). With a mean demand of 80, the standard 4-period demand is 320; adding the 275-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 595. This allows the backend to order units needed to cover actual upcoming demand despite the persistent phantom stock.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we face an ending on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant phantom inventory problem. There are 275 units from Period 2, 3, and 13 that are still counted in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Additionally, the Period 43 order (81 units) and Period 45 order (127 units) are in the pipeline. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 'In-transit' count of 610 (which includes the 275 phantom units), I must inflate mu_hat. The current demand regime (P33-P45) averages approximately 80 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 2 (promised), the base stock calculation normally covers 3 periods of demand (L+1). My explicit mu_hat is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock) + Phantom Inventory. Desired Base Stock = 80 units/period * 3 periods = 240 units. Adding the 275 phantom units gives a mu_hat of 515. This allows the backend to see the need for units beyond the 335 actual units in transit (610 total - 275 phantom). Sigma_hat is set to 50 to account for high recent volatility (demand ranging from 5 to 144).

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory is 63 units following Period 46 demand of 18. The current demand regime (P33-P46) averages approximately 80 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the 275 units of phantom inventory (orders from P2, P3, and P13) which have been lost for over 30 periods but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 529). To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 275 units. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * expected_demand + phantom_offset. With L=2 (promised) and expected demand of 80, the base mu_hat is 240. Adding the 275 unit offset results in 515. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for high recent volatility (e.g., P44 demand 126 vs P46 demand 18). L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P41, P43) have confirmed a lead time of 3, but the backend's base-stock calculation is more stable with the default setting when manually adjusting mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 47, 275 units (P2, P3, P13) remain lost in the pipeline; mu_hat must be inflated by 275 to offset this phantom inventory. Demand (P33-P46) averages ~80 units with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system is managing a significant amount of 'phantom inventory'. There are 275 units from Period 2, 3, and 13 that are effectively lost but still count towards 'In-transit' (529 units). The on-hand inventory is 39 units. Recent demand (P33-P47) has been highly volatile, averaging approximately 76 units per period. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 529 units of pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, it will likely result in an order of 0 unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the current demand regime (~76 units) and accounts for the 275 units of phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Phantom Offset. With L=2, (3*76) + 275 = 503. I will set mu_hat to 503 to force the backend to recognize that 275 of its perceived supply is non-existent. Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for the base calculation but allow the mu_hat inflation to provide the necessary buffer.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 48, 275 units (P2, P3, P13) remain lost in the pipeline; mu_hat must be inflated by 275 to offset this phantom inventory. Demand (P33-P47) averages ~76 units with high volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the system shows On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 405 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 275 of those units (from P2, P3, and P13) are 'phantom inventory'\u2014they have been lost for over 30 periods and will likely never arrive. The true actionable pipeline is 130 units (orders from P48 and potentially recent unsatiated demand logic). Demand remains highly volatile; the last period (P48) saw a spike to 192 units, while the previous two were very low (18, 24). The average demand over the last 15 periods (P34-P48) is approximately 80.4 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 275-unit phantom inventory block, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * mean_demand + 275. Using L=2 (promised) and mean=80, mu_hat = (3 * 80) + 275 = 515. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the high volatility (30 to 192) observed in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a critical situation: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have observed a significant demand spike in the last two periods (P48: 192, P49: 182), which is more than double the previous regime average of ~80. The 275 units from P2, P3, and P13 remain lost in the pipeline ('phantom inventory'), and the 'In-transit' count of 589 units includes these lost units plus the 187 units ordered in P49 and 127 units ordered in P45 (which arrived in P48). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the high phantom in-transit count, I will use 'explicit' values. I'll set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time recently) and mu_hat to a value that covers the new high demand level (approx 185 units/period) for L+1 periods (4 periods) PLUS the 275 unit phantom inventory offset. Calculation: (185 * 4) + 275 = 1015. Sigma_hat is set high to account for the extreme volatility observed between the 18-unit lows and 192-unit highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P48-P49 demand averaged 187 units, a +130% increase from the previous ~80 unit average. Phantom inventory of 275 units (P2, P3, P13) remains stuck in the pipeline.
