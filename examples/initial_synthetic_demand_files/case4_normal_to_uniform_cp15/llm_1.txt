The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption: no orders have arrived since Period 36, despite an 'In-transit' balance of 1,012 units. Analysis of order history confirms that P30 (130 units) and P32 (150 units) are lost. The remaining in-transit pipeline consists of orders from P41 (140) and P43 (140), plus likely lost units from previous periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced 4 consecutive periods of stockouts. Since there are only 7 periods remaining in the game (P44-P50) and lead times are highly unreliable (up to 3 periods or lost), I must order to cover potential demand while acknowledging that 'In-transit' units from P30-P33 are likely never arriving. I will order 140 units to try and capture demand in the final periods, assuming the P41 order might arrive by P44 or P45.",

Inventory finally arrived in Period 44 (140 units from the P41 order), leaving 14 units on-hand. The current in-transit pipeline is 1012 units, but this includes confirmed lost shipments from P30 (130) and P32 (150). Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is approximately 732 units. Given we are at Period 45 of 50, and demand averages roughly 80-100 units across all regimes, the remaining demand for the final 5 periods (P46-P50) is estimated at 400-500 units. The current effective pipeline (732) and the orders already placed in P43 and P44 (140 each) are sufficient to cover this remaining demand, even accounting for a 20-25% shipment loss rate. Adding more inventory now would likely result in excessive holding costs at the end of the game (Period 50).",

This pipeline includes confirmed or highly likely lost orders from Period 30 (130 units) and Period 32 (150 units), totaling 280 units. Subtracting these from the 1012 in-transit units leaves an effective pipeline of 732 units. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), and an average demand of ~100 units, the total remaining expected demand is approximately 500 units. The effective pipeline of 732 units (which includes recent orders from P43 and P44 totaling 280 units) is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand through the end of the simulation. Given the holding cost of $1.0/unit, any further ordering would only increase unnecessary inventory and lead to holding costs at the end of Period 50.

Given the endgame horizon (3 periods remaining), the effective pipeline must be scrutinized. The current 'In-transit' of 872 is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P30 (130 units) and P32 (150 units). However, the order from P44 (140 units) is expected to arrive in P47 or P48. Including on-hand stock (122) and the P44 expected arrival (140), we have at least 262 units available to cover the remaining 3 periods. With an average demand of ~85-90 units, 262 units is sufficient. Ordering more now would only arrive in P50 (the final period) and would likely result in excessive holding costs for any units not sold in that single final window.

Given that there are only three periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50), and the current on-hand stock (98) is significantly higher than the average demand of the last two periods, there is sufficient inventory to cover the likely requirements. Even if a high-demand period (~140) occurs, the combination of current stock and the large 'In-transit' pipeline (872 units, though ~280 units are confirmed lost) makes additional orders unnecessary and financially risky due to holding costs. Specifically, an order from Period 44 (140 units) is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods based on the recent 3-period lead time observed for P41 and P43.

Even accounting for a 25-30% loss rate (confirmed losses from P30 and P32), the effective pipeline remains approximately 592 units.

Any new order placed now would arrive, at the earliest, in Period 50 (if lead time is 1) or after the game ends (if lead time is 2-3), and would likely only incur unnecessary holding costs or arrive too late to be useful.
