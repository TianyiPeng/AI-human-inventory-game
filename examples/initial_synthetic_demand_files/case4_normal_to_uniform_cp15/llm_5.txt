Therefore, the effective pipeline consists of orders from P40 (80), P41 (170), and P42 (100), totaling 350 units. With 124 units on hand, the total inventory position is 474 units. This covers roughly 4-6 periods of average demand (approx 80-100 units/period including safety stock). Given the high loss rate and current healthy inventory position, I will place a moderate order to maintain the pipeline while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit) if multiple orders arrive simultaneously.",

Demand is highly volatile with an average of ~80 units over the last 5 periods (30, 139, 89, 76, 60). Given the high loss rate, I must over-order slightly to ensure availability while managing holding costs ($1/unit vs $4/unit profit). Target inventory for (L+1=4) periods is approx 320 units (80 * 4). Total pipeline (On-hand 144 + Active In-transit 350) is 494 units. However, assuming a 30% loss rate on the 350 units in-transit, the effective pipeline is closer to 144 + (350 * 0.7) = 389 units.

Since there is no Period 51 or beyond in this simulation, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand or contribute to the final reward. Demand resolution occurs after the decision phase but before the conclusion of the period. Since on-hand inventory is already 0, no units can be sold this period regardless of the order placed.
