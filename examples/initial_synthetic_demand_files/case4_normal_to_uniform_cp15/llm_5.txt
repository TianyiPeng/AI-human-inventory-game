Given the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0) and the lack of immediate upward demand signal, the optimal strategy for Period 35 is to place no order (0 units) to allow the existing stock to deplete and minimize holding costs while still maintaining a safe buffer for any potential return to average demand levels.",

Since 128 units is already significantly higher than the average demand (~95) and covers all but the most extreme historical spikes (only P8, P21, P28, P29, P31, P35 were higher than 128), I will place a small order of 32 units.
