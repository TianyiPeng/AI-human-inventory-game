Historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] suggest an average demand of approximately 111 units per period. The product is a standard snack item with relatively stable demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Since I start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I am facing immediate stockouts for the first 5 periods (Period 1-5). To maximize profit, I must establish a pipeline that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). A safe initial stock level to aim for is (5 periods * 111 units/period) + a safety buffer for variance. However, given the significant delay (4 periods), I will order a consistent amount to fill the pipeline. I will order 550 units to cover the expected demand for the timeframe until the first shipment arrives and becomes usable.",

The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 133 units. In Period 29, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory and 112 units of unmet demand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Therefore, we must cover demand for the lead time (P30, P31, P32, P33) plus the current period (P30), totaling 5 periods of demand. Pipeline assessment: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P27 (75), P28 (150), and P29 (200), total 425. We expect these to arrive in P31, P32, and P33 respectively. With no arrival in P30, we will stock out again. To reach a safe target for the 5-period window (approx 133 * 5 = 665 units) and rebuild safety stock to account for the \ucd5c\uadfc high volatility, we need to order enough to bridge the gap. Order calculation: 700 (target) - 0 (on-hand) - 425 (in-transit) = 275. Given the high stockout cost vs holding cost ($4 vs $1), I will place an order of 250 units to aggressively restock the pipeline while slightly tempering for long-term average reversion.",

Demand analysis: The current high-volatility regime shows a mean of approximately 85-90 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45 avg: 86.6). Inventory Status: On-hand is 134. In-transit consists of orders from P42 (115), P43 (100), P44 (100), and P45 (100), totaling 415 units. Expected arrivals: P46 (115 from P42), P47 (100 from P43), P48 (100 from P44), P49 (100 from P45). Total projected supply (On-hand 134 + In-transit 415) is 549 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is approximately 430-450 units (assuming mean ~87-90). Since the total supply (549) already covers the expected demand for the remaining periods with a healthy safety margin, no further orders are required. Ordering more would only incur holding costs on ending inventory at P50.",
