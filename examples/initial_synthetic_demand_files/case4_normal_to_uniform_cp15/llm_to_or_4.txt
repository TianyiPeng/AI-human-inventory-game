Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Since we are at the start of the simulation with no observed lead time data or seasonality context provided in the dates, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the backend to utilize the full historical demand set and the promised lead time of 2. The OR engine will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, targeting a service level q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.80.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The order for 141 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and, given the promised lead time of 2 periods, is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. In Period 1, we experienced a lost sale of 107 units because on-hand inventory was 0. Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107] shows a mean of approximately 110.6. Since there is no evidence of a regime shift yet (the last demand of 107 is within the historical range), I will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which utilizes all available samples. For lead time, I will stick with the promised 2 periods (default). The OR engine will calculate a base stock based on a critical ratio of 0.8 (4/(4+1)), ensuring a high service level while the pipeline inventory (141 units) is accounted for to prevent over-ordering.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including pre-game data) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and the two game periods [107, 116]. The mean demand is approximately 111.4 units. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 2 (Lead Time = 1), which is shorter than the promised lead time of 2. We have 25 units on hand and 137 units in-transit (ordered in Period 2, expected to arrive in Period 3 if L=1). I will set L to 1 to reflect this observed behavior. I'll use all 7 available demand samples (5 pre-game + 2 game) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain stability, as no clear demand regime shift is detected yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe a stockout in Period 3 where demand (64) exceeded on-hand inventory (25), resulting in only 25 units sold. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (actual lead time = 1). Period 2's order (137 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 or 4 based on this observed speed, but Period 3's conclude message shows 0 arrivals. Currently, 216 units are in-transit (Orders from P2 and P3). Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64] shows a slight dip in the most recent period, but given the stockout, we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time of 1, and use mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent demand levels (avg ~100) while smoothing the recent 64. Sigma_hat 'default' will handle the volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have lost sales in the last two periods due to a stockout. Historical demands are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from description) and observed demands in game are [107, 116, 64, 92]. The average demand is roughly 104 units. Regarding lead time: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (Actual LT = 1), but orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) have not arrived yet. If LT were 1, the Period 2 order should have arrived in Period 3. Since it is now Period 5 and they are missing, the actual lead time is likely 2 or more, or shipments are delayed/lost. The current 'In-transit' is 234 units (137 + 79 + 18). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed averages, and use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (approx 95 units per period). I will use explicit sigma_hat to account for higher volatility given the recent stockouts and lead time uncertainty, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover inventory.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. History shows the Period 1 order arrived in Period 2 (Actual L=1). However, orders from Period 2 (137 units), Period 3 (79 units), and Period 4 (18 units) are all currently in-transit (total 234 units) and have not yet arrived. Specifically, the Period 2 order is now 4 periods old, and the Period 3 order is 3 periods old; both have exceeded the promised lead time of 2. This indicates a significant lead-time extension or potential lost shipments. Demand has fluctuated (107, 116, 64, 92, 88), with an average around 93 units. Because the supply chain is currently unreliable (on-hand is 0, units are stuck in transit), I will set L to 4 to account for the delayed arrivals of the Period 2 and 3 orders. For demand, I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the recent demand seems slightly lower than the initial samples. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods, helping to bridge the gap caused by the delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is exceeding promised 2 periods; Period 2 and 3 orders (total 216 units) are overdue as of Period 6.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 361 units in-transit. Past demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84] suggests a mean of ~101. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show inconsistency: Period 1 arrived in 1 period, but orders from Period 2 (137 units), Period 3 (79 units), Period 4 (18 units), and Period 5 (0 units) have not arrived by Period 6's conclusion. Specifically, the Period 2 order is now 3 periods overdue (Lead Time would be 5+), and Period 3 is 2 periods overdue. Since 361 units are in the pipeline (137+79+18+0+127), and recent demand is stable around 85-90, the pipeline theoretically covers ~4 periods of demand if they arrive. However, to account for the supply chain disruption, I will explicitly increase the lead time L to 4 to reflect the current delay trend. I'll use recent_N=5 for demand (avg ~83) to reflect the slight downward trend in the last 5 periods [116, 64, 92, 88, 84], which prevents the OR engine from over-ordering while waiting for the massive pipeline to clear.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from Period 2 and 3 (216 units) are at least 3 periods overdue; lead time has shifted from 1-2 to 4+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~94 over the last 5 periods (64, 92, 88, 84, 93). On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 462 units in-transit. A significant supply disruption is occurring: orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are now 5-6 periods overdue and likely lost or severely delayed. The Period 4 order arrived in Period 7 with a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting that while the supply chain isn't completely dead, the promised lead time of 2 is no longer reliable. To manage this, I am setting L to 4 (explicitly) to reflect the increased delay observed. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (mean ~84 across 5 periods, but calculating for (1+L) periods). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for recent volatility. This conservative lead time estimate will increase the base stock level to help recover from the stockout once shipments stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: Period 4 order arrived with L=3; however, Period 2 and 3 orders are still missing after 5+ periods, suggesting potential shipment loss or extreme variance.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 462 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (92, 88, 84, 93, 137) averages 98.8, with a significant jump to 137 in the most recent period. Lead time is highly unstable: while promised as 2, we have seen L=1 (P1), L=3 (P4), and orders from P2 (137 units) and P3 (79 units) are now 6-7 periods overdue, which strongly suggests they are lost. To compensate for the supply chain instability and the recent demand spike, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the observed delays and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'm using N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~100/period, but I am setting L=4, which forces the OR engine to calculate demand over 5 periods (L+1). This higher safety buffer is necessary to recover from stockouts once shipments resume.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are likely lost as they are >5 periods past promised lead time. Demand shows a potential upward trend (137 in P8 vs ~90 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain remains unstable. We have observed lead times of 1, 3, and 3 periods for orders from Periods 1, 4, and 6 respectively. Orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are now 7-8 periods past their order date and are effectively lost. The current in-transit inventory (408) consists of orders from P7 (119), P9 (73), and the new order from P10. Demand has fluctuated: the last 5 periods show [88, 84, 93, 137, 78], with an average of 96. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the recent realized lead times. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean, which accounts for the P8 spike while acknowledging the P9 drop. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand, adjusted for the large pipeline inventory (minus the lost units which the OR backend doesn't know are lost, so I keep L at 3 and \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 reflective of reality).

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are confirmed lost (>5 periods past promised lead time). Actual lead time is stabilized at 3 periods based on P7 and P9 arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 44 units. Analyzing the history, orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are now 8-9 periods past their order date and are effectively lost. Recent arrival data from Period 7, 9, and 10 consistently show an actual lead time of 3 periods (L=3), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. Demand has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean of 100-110 units, with a recent spike to 124 in P10. To account for the shifted lead time, I am setting L explicitly to 3. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 samples (N=5: 93, 137, 78, 124, plus the inferred demand from P6 of 84) to capture the current mean which is approx 103.2. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3) * 103.2 = 412.8. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility over the same period to ensure the base stock covers demand uncertainty during this extended lead time. The OR engine will subtract the valid in-transit units (ordered P9 and P11, as P2/P3 are ignored by the backend's logic if they never arrive) from the base stock to determine the order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by P7, P9, and P10 arrivals); Orders from P2 and P3 are officially considered lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 12. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 413 units (orders from P9: 73, P11: 124, and the presumed lost orders from P2: 137 and P3: 79). Although P2 and P3 are officially considered lost (as noted in Period 11 carry-over), they still technically sit in the 'In-transit' count of 413. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. If I don't adjust L or mu_hat, the backend will see 413 units in-transit and likely order 0. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 'ghost' inventory from P2 and P3, I will set L to 3 (the stabilized actual lead time) and use mu_hat with 'explicit' to manually set the target demand for (L+1)=4 periods. Historical demand mean is approximately 97. (1+3) * 97 = 388. However, because the backend will subtract the 413 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to a value high enough to trigger an order that covers upcoming demand. Since we need to cover demand while accounting for the 216 lost units (137+79) still in the system count, I'll set mu_hat explicitly to (4 * 100) + 216 = 616 to offset the lost units. Sigma is set to recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current inventory status is 0 on-hand with 548 units in-transit. Analysis of the 'conclude' messages from Periods 7, 9, 10, and 12 confirms a stable actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, which differs from the promised 2. Specifically, the orders from P4, P6, P7, and P9 all arrived with L=3. The orders from P2 and P3 are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P1-P12) shows a mean of approximately 94.4 units per period. Because the lead time is consistently 3, I am setting L explicitly to 3. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture the full operational history while acknowledging the 3-period lead time. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level covering L+1 (4) periods of demand (~377 units), accounting for the pipeline inventory to determine the next order.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 104 units with 340 units in-transit. The game history shows that orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) were lost. Recent arrivals confirm a shift in lead time: Period 4 arrived in 3 periods, Period 6 in 3 periods, Period 7 in 3 periods, Period 9 in 3 periods, but surprisingly Period 12 arrived in 1 period. Despite the recent outlier of 1 period, the sustained pattern prior to that was 3 periods. I will use L=3 to remain cautious against recent delays. Demand is relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 92 units per period (78, 124, 58, 92, 104). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current demand level across (L+1)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability noted: while P12 arrived in 1 period, P4, P6, P7, and P9 all experienced a lead time of 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we have 113 units on-hand and 216 units in-transit. Crucially, the 216 units in-transit are the lost shipments from Period 2 (137) and Period 3 (79). Since the OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it will see this 216 as available supply and fail to place new orders unless we adjust the parameters. To force the backend to ignore these 'ghost' units, I will set L to 1 (the most recent actual lead time) and provide an explicit mu_hat that is high enough to compensate for the 216 units. The demand is currently stable around a mean of 100. Using L=1, the logic requires covering (1+L)=2 periods of demand (~200 units). To offset the 216 units the backend thinks we have, I will set mu_hat to approximately (Demand * (1+L)) + Lost_Units = 200 + 216 = 416. This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline inventory, maintaining service levels despite the supply chain data mismatch.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 units after demand exhausted the remaining stock in Period 15. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 334 units, consisting of orders from Period 12 (though P12 conclude suggests P12 order arrived, there might be a calculation discrepancy in the prompt's 'In-transit' sum vs history, but I must focus on the current state). Observed lead times have fluctuated: P12 arrived in 1 period, while P11, P9, P7, and P6 all took 3 periods. Given this variability and the goal to maximize profit while minimizing stockouts, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the most frequent actual lead time. Demand is relatively stable but showed a slight uptick recently; the last 5 periods (P11-P15) had an average demand of 97.4. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent average and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 4 periods) is responsive to current trends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 57 with 313 units in-transit. The demand history shows a relatively stable mean despite some fluctuations (recent demand: 92, 104, 115, 118, 61). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 101 units. Lead time analysis from the 'conclude' messages reveals significant instability: P4, P6, P7, P9, and P11 arrived with L=3, while P1, P12, and P15 arrived with L=1. Given the promised lead time is 2, and the most frequent actual lead time is 3, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory covers the (L+1) period window and account for the risk of delays. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent 10-period window to capture the current demand level (~101/period) projected over 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a sufficient safety buffer for the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (most recent P15 was 1 period, but P11 was 3 periods). Setting planning horizon L=3 is necessary for stockout protection.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand plummeted to 6 units, which appears to be a significant outlier or the start of a sharp downward trend compared to the previous average of ~95. More critically, the pipeline inventory (374 units) incorrectly includes 216 units from Periods 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I must artificially inflate the base stock. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For mu_hat, I'm targeting a base stock that covers the actual lead time (L=3) plus the current period (L+1=4) for an average demand of ~95, PLUS the 216 lost units. Calculation: (4 * 95) + 216 = 596. For sigma_hat, I will use a conservative estimate to maintain a high service level despite recent volatility. I am setting L=3 to match the observed maximum lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand anomaly in Period 17 (demand=6); monitoring for potential regime shift or outlier status. Ghost inventory of 216 units (P2, P3) continues to inflate pipeline inventory, requiring base stock compensation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand recovered to 87 units, confirming that the demand of 6 in Period 17 was a one-time outlier rather than a regime shift. I will continue to use a demand forecast based on the recent average excluding the outlier. The supply chain remains unstable, with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (most recently 3 periods for P11, and no arrival for P17 yet). Therefore, I maintain L=3 for planning to ensure the base stock covers the 4-period horizon (L+1). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 573 units is significantly inflated by 216 units from Period 2 and 3, which are confirmed lost. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from the base stock; to compensate for these 216 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that adds 216 units to the standard (1+L)*mean calculation. Mean demand (excl. outlier) is approx 100. Expected mu_hat = (1+3)*100 = 400. Compensated mu_hat = 400 + 216 = 616.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context for chips(Regular) shows a significant dip in Period 17 (6 units) and Period 19 (43 units), though the long-term average remains around 90-100 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline is heavily inflated by 216 units from Period 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost but still registered as 'in-transit'. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand despite this 'ghost inventory', I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed (P4, P6, P7, P9, P11). I am setting mu_hat to 400 (which is approximately (1+L) * 100) and sigma_hat to 60. This explicit base stock calculation (effectively aiming for ~400 units) will force the OR engine to place an order because (base_stock - pipeline) will still result in a positive order value once the ghost inventory of 216 is subtracted from the 677 total in-transit units, helping recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost inventory of 216 units (P2, P3) remains in pipeline; planning parameters adjusted to compensate for this bias to avoid chronic under-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the current inventory position is 178 on-hand with 417 units in-transit. However, the in-transit figure includes 216 units from Period 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). The adjusted pipeline is 201 units (417 - 216). Recent arrivals (P17, P18) show lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively, confirming the need to maintain L=3 for planning to ensure the OR backend covers enough demand during lead time variability. Demand in Period 17 (6 units) was an outlier; excluding it, recent demand (P18-P20) averages approximately 71 units, while the longer-term average is closer to 90. To balance the risk of stockouts against the relatively high holding cost ($1 vs $4 profit), I am using L=3 and a mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the recent volatility and slightly lower mean while ignoring the ghost inventory bias in the backend calculations by using 'explicit' L to increase the base stock requirement.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe on-hand inventory has dropped to 7 units after a high demand of 171 in Period 21. The lead time (L) remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (most recently 3, 2, and 1 across various history). I will maintain L=3 for conservative planning to prevent stockouts. The 'ghost inventory' of 216 units (from Period 2 and 3) is still trapped in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Average demand is ~94 units/period. For a horizon of (1+L) = 4 periods, expected demand is 376. However, the OR backend sees 417 in-transit (which includes the 216 ghost units). Effective pipeline is actually 417 - 216 = 201. To force an order that covers the gap, I set mu_hat = 376 (forecast) + 216 (offset) = 592. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom 216 units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility while ignoring the Period 17 outlier (demand=6).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 640 units. However, this pipeline is heavily inflated by 216 units from Period 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost (as noted in Carry-Over Insights), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is actually 424 units (Orders from P16, P19, P22). Demand is highly volatile (ranging from 6 to 171 recently), but the long-term mean remains around 90-100 units. Lead times are also unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods (P17 arrived in 3, P18 in 2). To protect against both lead time variance and demand spikes while compensating for the 'ghost inventory' (the 216 lost units), I will set L=3 to extend the planning horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture recent demand variability while smoothing the P17 outlier (demand=6). For sigma_hat, N=10 will be used to reflect the high recent volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) after two periods of zero arrivals. The 'in-transit' inventory of 640 units includes 216 units from Period 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory), making the effective pipeline 424 units (640 - 216). This effective pipeline consists of orders from P19 (104 units, L=2 expected), P22 (223 units, L=2 expected), and P16 (97 units, which is now significantly overdue and may also be lost). Historical lead times have been highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (P4, P6, P7, P9, P11, P17). To protect against this volatility and the recent stockout, I am setting L to 3. For demand, I am using the last 15 periods (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat; this period range captures both the recent low-demand outliers (P17, P23) and the high-demand spikes (P21), providing a balanced but conservative estimate (average demand ~80). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 and L=3, the OR backend will calculate a base stock for a 4-period horizon (L+1), helping to recover from the stockout despite the pipeline bias.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports a pipeline inventory of 640 units, but historical analysis confirms that 216 units (ordered in P2 and P3) are lost. This 'ghost inventory' causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order by 216 units. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 3 periods (the most frequent actual lead time) would normally be (1+3) * mean_demand. With an average demand of approximately 85 units, the base mu_hat should be 340. Adding the 216-unit ghost inventory correction yields 556. To be conservative against recent high volatility (demand range 6 to 171) and current zero on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat to 600. L is set to 3 to reflect the actual supply chain performance. Sigma_hat remains 'default' to allow the backend to use historical standard deviation, which captures the recent high-variance spikes.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 216 units (P2, P3) persists in the pipeline; mu_hat must be inflated by 216 units relative to the forecast to ensure the OR engine places orders for the correct net amount.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the on-hand inventory is 164 units following the arrival of the Period 22 order (L=3). The pipeline inventory currently stands at 439 units, but this includes 216 units from Period 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost (the 'ghost inventory'). The actual effective pipeline is 223 units (439 - 216). Recent demand has been lower and more volatile (P23: 12, P24: 56, P25: 59) compared to the long-term average. Lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=3 for safety. To compensate for the 216 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly includes in its 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period demand average (~71.4), a standard base stock would be ~285 units. Adding the 216 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 501. This ensures the OR backend triggers an order when the true inventory position drops, rather than being suppressed by the non-existent units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $474.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 216 units from Period 2 and 3, which are permanently lost but still count toward the pipeline inventory in the OR backend's logic. To prevent the system from under-ordering by this amount, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by 216 units. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P25 arrived in 1, P22 in 3); I am setting L=3 to maintain a conservative planning horizon and protect against stockouts during longer arrival cycles. Demand has shown recent volatility, with a significant spike to 132 in Period 26 after a period of lower activity. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and standard deviation calculations to capture the current mean of approximately 70 units/period while accounting for this volatility. Therefore, mu_hat is calculated as: (1 + L) * mean(last 10) + 216 = (1 + 3) * 69.5 + 216 = 278 + 216 = 494.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 27 (demand 111 vs 54 available). Current demand is highly volatile, ranging from 12 to 171 in recent periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 527 units is heavily distorted by 216 units of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 2 and 3, which are confirmed lost. The remaining valid pipeline consists of orders from Period 19 (104 units), Period 27 (110 units), and the current decision. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P22=3, P25=1). To protect against the longer lead time of 3, I set L=3. The OR engine calculates orders using the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline. Since the backend includes the 216 lost units in the pipeline calculation, it will under-order by exactly 216 units. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * avg_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=3 and a recent 10-period average demand of ~70 units, the calculation is (4 * 70) + 216 = 496. This ensures the OR engine places a net order that ignores the lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 28 was 157, continuing a recent volatile but generally high trend (avg last 5 periods ~94, but peaks up to 157). Lead times remain inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P25 and P27 both arrived in 1 period, but P22 took 3). I will maintain L=3 for planning to ensure safety stock covers the potential longer delay. The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 216 units from Periods 2 and 3 that never arrived and are permanently stuck in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock is calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. The engine then subtracts pipeline (466 units, which includes 216 ghost units). Current demand mean (last 10 periods) is ~70. For a (1+L)=4 period horizon, expected demand is ~280. To offset the 216 ghost units and ensure a positive order is generated, I set mu_hat explicitly to 550 (approx 334 real requirement + 216 offset).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we face 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 591 units. As documented in the carry-over insights, 216 of these units (from Periods 2 and 3) are 'ghost inventory' that will never arrive. The true pipeline is 375 units (comprising orders from P19: 104 units and P29: 174 units, plus the unidentified remainder from recent periods). Demand has recently increased, with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging 118.4 units, compared to the overall historical mean of ~90. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P27, P28 both took 1 period, but P22 took 3). To protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status and volatile lead times, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. For mu_hat, I must compensate for the OR backend's use of the inflated pipeline inventory (which includes the 216 lost units). I calculate the base demand forecast for (1+L) periods using the recent average (4 * 118.4 = 473.6) and then add the 216 ghost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 689.6. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility seen in the recent demand spike.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory is reported as 752 units. However, this includes 'ghost inventory' of 216 units from Periods 2 and 3 that are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is 536 units (Orders from P29: 174, P30: 161, and likely P19: 104, P16: 97 - though P16/P19 are very late and might also be lost). Demand has shown increased volatility recently (P28: 157, P29: 133, P30: 81). Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P25: 1, P27: 1, P28: 1, while P22 was 3). To ensure the OR engine (which uses base_stock - pipeline) orders enough, mu_hat must be adjusted to compensate for the 216 ghost units. The forecast for (1+L) periods, assuming L=2 (planning horizon L=2 for L+1=3 periods of demand), with a mean demand of ~95, is 285. Adding the 216 unit compensation results in mu_hat = 501. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 216 units (P2, P3) remains in pipeline as of P31; mu_hat continues to be inflated to compensate for the OR engine's inability to discount lost shipments.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system shows 752 units in-transit. Based on historical lead times (typically 1-3 periods), shipments from Period 2 (137), Period 3 (79), Period 16 (97), and Period 19 (104) are definitively lost as they are all over 12 periods past due. This creates a 'ghost inventory' of 417 units that the OR engine incorrectly counts towards the pipeline. To ensure the backend places an order that actually meets demand, I must inflate mu_hat by these 417 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 97 units per period. With a planning lead time L=3 to account for historical volatility (observed L frequently hitting 3), the expected demand across (L+1) periods is 4 * 97 = 388. Adding the 417-unit compensation, the explicit mu_hat is set to 805. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to maintain the service level.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory has increased to 417 units (P2, P3, P16, P19) as of Period 32; mu_hat must be inflated by 417 units to offset the OR engine's pipeline bias.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observe an ending on-hand inventory of 141 units and an in-transit pipeline of 718 units. However, this pipeline is significantly inflated by 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that are almost certainly lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (137 units), P3 (79 units), P16 (97 units), and P19 (104 units) total 417 units. These orders are well beyond the typical lead time of 1-3 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock to determine the order quantity, we must inflate our mu_hat by 417 units to neutralize this bias. Demand is currently volatile (P30: 81, P31: 163, P32: 33), but averages approximately 95 units over the last 10 periods. We set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed (e.g., P29 arrived in 3 periods). Using L=3 and a 10-period demand average of ~95, the 'correct' base stock would be around (3+1) * 95 = 380 units. To ensure the backend orders correctly while seeing 417 ghost units, we set mu_hat explicitly to (380 + 417) = 797. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory has increased to 417 units (P2, P3, P16, P19) as of Period 32; mu_hat must be inflated by 417 units to offset the OR engine's pipeline bias.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was extremely low (5 units), following a low Period 32 (33 units), suggesting a potential short-term dip or high volatility compared to the previous high-demand regime (P28-P31 averaged ~133). On-hand inventory is currently 136. The 'In-transit' figure is 746 units, but this includes 417 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P3, P16, P19) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (746) from the base stock. To ensure the engine actually orders enough to cover future demand, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of this ghost inventory (417 units). For lead time, I am using L=3 to remain conservative given the frequent 3-period arrivals (P29 arrived in 3 periods). I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the recent mix of high and low demand periods while being responsive to the current downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory has remained at 417 units (P2, P3, P16, P19) as of Period 33; mu_hat must be inflated by 417 units to offset the OR engine's pipeline bias.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current on-hand inventory is 118 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 746 units is heavily distorted by 417 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P3, P16, and P19) which the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. With L=3 (the observed upper bound of lead time variance), and a recent average demand of approximately 94 units (last 20 periods), the required mu_hat is ((1+3) * 94) + 417 = 793. I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety buffer against the observed lead time volatility (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to its default to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 118 units against a demand of 144 in Period 35. The 'In-transit' pipeline is 747 units, but this includes 417 units from Periods 2, 3, 16, and 19 which are long overdue and confirmed lost (ghost inventory). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will count these lost units as available, leading to chronic under-ordering. To correct this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that equals (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + (Ghost Inventory). Current demand is highly volatile (P33: 5, P34: 18, P35: 144), so I'll use the recent 10-period average of ~78 units/period. For L=3, the planning horizon is 4 periods. Base mu_hat = 78 * 4 = 312. Adding the 417 units of ghost inventory yields an explicit mu_hat of 729. I am using L=3 (explicit) to reflect the upper bound of the observed 1-3 period lead time variance to ensure availability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the recent high demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face a significant inventory challenge. The 'In-transit' quantity is 802 units, but this includes 417 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P3, P16, and P19) which are long overdue and confirmed lost. The remaining 385 units are recently placed orders (P30, P32, P35, P36). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has been volatile, with P35 and P36 showing a return to higher levels (144, 92) after a brief lull. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to plan with L=3 to ensure safety during longer delays. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 417 units of ghost inventory in its pipeline calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 93.7. For L=3, the planning horizon is 4 periods (L+1). Calculation: (4 periods * 93.7) + 417 ghost units = 791.8. I will set mu_hat to 792 and use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 to account for high demand variance and protect against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory persists at 417 units (P2, P3, P16, P19) as of Period 36; mu_hat remains inflated to offset pipeline bias.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand inventory is 51. The ghost inventory (lost shipments from P2, P3, P16, P19) remains in the pipeline at 417 units. Based on historical arrivals (P36 arrived in 1 period, P33 in 3 periods), lead time remains volatile. I will use L=3 to ensure a sufficient planning horizon. Demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) has been highly variable, averaging 85.8 units per period. To compensate for the 417 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available supply, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=3, (L+1)=4. Target base stock should be (4 * 85.8) + 417 = 760.2. Setting mu_hat to 760.2 ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that results in an actual order, despite the pipeline bias. Sigma_hat is set to default to allow the engine to calculate volatility based on the full history, providing a standard safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39, the supply chain continues to suffer from 'ghost inventory' caused by lost shipments (Periods 2, 3, 16, 19, 30, 31, 32, 35) totaling 719 units. Since the OR backend uses this inflated 'In-transit' value to reduce new orders, I must inflate mu_hat by the same amount (719) to ensure the net order reflects actual demand needs. Lead time remains volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining L=3 for safety. Demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) averages 87 units per period. Using L=3 implies a planning horizon of 4 periods (L+1). Calculation: (4 periods * 87 avg demand) + 719 ghost inventory = 1067. I've set mu_hat to 1067 and used a recent_N sigma_hat (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory has increased to 719 units (Orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P31, P32, P35 are missing/lost) as of Period 39; mu_hat must be inflated by 719 units to offset the OR engine's pipeline bias.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1079 units is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments that the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline). Specifically, orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), P16 (97), P19 (104), P30 (161), P31 (0), P32 (140), and P35 (1) are significantly past their expected arrival dates based on the observed lead time variance (1-3 periods). These missing units total 719 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these false pipeline units, mu_hat must be inflated. Recent demand shows high volatility (e.g., 144, 92, 32, 100, 30), so I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand levels (~78 units/period). Lead time L is set to 3 to provide a buffer against the observed variability (alternating between 1 and 3 periods). mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Mean(last 10) + Ghost Inventory = 4 * 77.9 + 719 \u2248 1030.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory has reached 719 units (P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35) as of Period 40. Demand remains volatile with an average of ~78 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 1,111 units. However, based on the historical tracking, a significant portion of this pipeline is 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), P16 (97), P19 (104), P30 (161), P31 (0), P32 (140), and P35 (1) are considered lost, totaling 719 units. The backend OR logic subtracts the total pipeline from the calculated base stock to determine the final order. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of the ghost inventory (719). The actual demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged 75.7 units. Using L=3 for safety due to the volatile lead times (varying between 1 and 3 periods), the required base stock for a 4-period window (L+1) is approximately 303 units. Adding the 719 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 1022. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 719 units (P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35) as of Period 40; mu_hat continues to be inflated to neutralize pipeline bias. Demand avg (last 10 periods) is ~76 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, the SKU is facing a severe inventory stockout with 0 on-hand and 1122 units 'in-transit'. Analysis of the history confirms a massive buildup of 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that have exceeded a reasonable lead time and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), P16 (97), P19 (104), P30 (161), P32 (140), and P35 (1) total 719 units. These units are visible to the OR engine but will never arrive to satisfy demand. To neutralize this 719-unit pipeline bias, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + 719. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 71.9 units. Using L=3 (to account for lead time volatility between 1 and 3 periods), the forecast for 4 periods (L+1) is 287.6. Adding the 719-unit compensation results in a mu_hat of ~1007. I will use 'explicit' to bypass the engine's default calculations which don't account for these losses. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation across the planning horizon to provide a safety buffer against high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 719 units (P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35) as of Period 41; mu_hat must remain inflated by this amount to offset the OR engine's pipeline inventory subtraction for lost shipments. Demand remains volatile but stable around a mean of ~72 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we received 360 units from the Period 39 order (lead time = 3). On-hand inventory is now 284 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 762 units, which is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory'. By cross-referencing history, I've identified the following missing/lost orders still in the pipeline: P2(137), P3(79), P16(97), P19(104), P30(161), P31(0 - skip), P32(140), and P35(1). Total Ghost Inventory = 137+79+97+104+161+140+1 = 719 units. The OR backend's order logic is: order = base_stock - (actual_in_transit + ghost_in_transit) - on_hand. To negate the ghost inventory subtraction, I must set mu_hat = (Forecasted_Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost_Inventory. Demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) averages ~76.3 units per period. Using L=3 (most recent observed lead time), the base requirement is 76.3 * 4 = 305.2. Adding the ghost inventory: 305.2 + 719 = 1024.2. I will use 1024 for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 55) scaled by sqrt(L+1), resulting in ~110.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains constant at 719 units (Orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35 are missing/lost). mu_hat must be inflated by 719 units to neutralize the OR engine's pipeline bias.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we have 256 units on-hand and 801 units in pipeline. However, the pipeline includes 719 units of 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, and P35 that are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (801 units) when calculating the order quantity. To ensure the backend places an order that covers actual future needs, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of this ghost inventory (719). Demand over the last 10 periods has stabilized around a mean of ~72 units. Lead time is volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will continue using L=3 for protection. The target mu_hat calculation is: (1 + L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory = (1 + 3) * 72 + 719 = 288 + 719 = 1007. I will use 'explicit' to provide this corrected value and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains constant at 719 units (Orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35 are lost). mu_hat must be inflated by 719 units to neutralize pipeline bias in the OR engine.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the on-hand inventory is 141 units. The total 'In-transit' reported is 814 units. Based on historical data, 719 units of this pipeline are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 814 - 719 = 95 units (consisting of orders from P43 and P44). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will subtract the full 814 units unless we inflate mu_hat. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 72 units. With a planning lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 72 * 3 = 216 units. To ensure the OR engine places a correct order despite the 719-unit pipeline bias, mu_hat must be set to approximately 216 + 719 = 935. This ensures the base stock calculated (approx 935) minus the inflated pipeline (814) results in a meaningful net order to maintain the desired service level. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility (~50 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing chips(Regular) with a ghost inventory of 719 units (Orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35). These units are effectively lost but remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. To ensure the backend places orders that satisfy actual demand, I must inflate mu_hat by 719 units. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is [92, 32, 100, 30, 139, 89, 76, 60, 126, 72], averaging 81.6 units per period. Using a planning horizon (L+1) where L=3 (to protect against recent lead time volatility of 1-3 periods), the required base stock is roughly 4 periods of demand. The OR backend calculates base stock as (1+L)*avg_demand + safety_stock. By setting mu_hat using 'explicit' with a value of (4 * 81.6) + 719 \u2248 1045, I neutralize the 719-unit pipeline bias and target a base stock level sufficient for 4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility (~37 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we have 122 units on-hand and 966 units in-transit. A significant portion of this pipeline (719 units) consists of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this non-existent stock, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by 719 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) averages ~64 units with significant volatility. Using N=10 for mu_hat (64.2 * (1+L)) plus the 719 offset results in a value of approximately 976. For lead time, I'll use 'explicit' value of 3, as the most recent arrivals (P39, P40, P41, P43) consistently demonstrate a 3-period lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory remains constant at 719 units (Orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35 are lost). Actual lead time is confirmed at 3 periods for recent shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is managed under highly volatile lead times (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and a significant 'ghost inventory' issue. The current pipeline inventory includes 719 units from missing or lost orders (P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35), which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from its base stock calculation. To ensure the backend places an actual order, I must set mu_hat to be the forecast for (1+L) periods PLUS the ghost inventory offset of 719 units. Based on recent history, the mean demand is approximately 75 units per period. With L=3 (chosen for safety due to frequent volatility), the planning horizon is 4 periods. Forecast = 4 * 75 = 300. Adjusted mu_hat = 300 + 719 = 1019. Sigma_hat is set to 120 (recent volatility ~60 * sqrt(4)).

Daily Profit: $768.00, Daily Holding Cost: $129.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $639.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 129 units. The pipeline (in-transit) is 799 units, but this is heavily distorted by 719 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35). Effective pipeline is only 80 units (from P44 and P48). Demand is highly volatile; P48 saw 192 units, while the 10-period average is ~84. To counter the OR backend's logic (which subtracts the full 799 in-transit units), I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. Target base stock calculation: (L+1) * \u03bc + Ghost Inventory. With L=3 (recent stable lead time) and \u03bc\u224884, Target = (4 * 84) + 719 = 1055. For sigma_hat, I'm using a recent window (N=10) to capture current volatility. L is set to explicit 3 to ensure a 4-period coverage window.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Current on-hand inventory is 3 units, with 965 units in-transit. Based on historical data, specifically 'Carry-over Insights', there is a cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 719 units (Orders from P2, P3, P16, P19, P30, P32, P35) that are considered lost and will never arrive. These 719 units remain in the backend OR engine's pipeline calculation, causing it to underestimate required orders. Therefore, I must inflate mu_hat by 719 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) has averaged approximately 97.8 units (including a recent spike to 182-192), while the overall historical average is lower. Given the recent surge in demand over the last 3 periods (P47-P49), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate demand statistics to capture this upward trend while maintaining some stability. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2 periods for the model, though actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand has surged significantly in the last 3 periods (avg ~132 vs historical ~85); monitoring if this is a sustained regime shift. Ghost inventory remains constant at 719 units.
