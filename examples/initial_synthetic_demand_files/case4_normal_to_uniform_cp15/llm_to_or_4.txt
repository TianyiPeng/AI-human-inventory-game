Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical observation of lead times or demand arrivals. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand data provided for 'chips(Regular)' shows: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the mean and standard deviation: Mean = 111.4, Std \u2248 17.5. Since the review plus lead time cycle is (1+L) = 5 periods, the expected demand across this window is 5 \xd7 111.4 = 557. The inventory coverage needed is approximately sqrt(5) \xd7 17.5 \u2248 39.1 for one standard deviation. Given zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we must initialize the pipeline. I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use the provided full historical sample for this initial decision, as there is no evidence yet of regime shifts or lead time drift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 107 units of lost sales (demand=107, sold=0). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the actual demand of 107 from Period 1. The demand appears relatively stable with a mean of approximately 110.7. Since no lead-time observations are available yet to contradict the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the new period 1 data point) to capture the most recent demand behavior and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In periods 1 and 2, demand was 107 and 116 respectively. Since we started with 0 inventory and the promised lead time is 4 periods, we haven't received any stock yet, resulting in 0 sales so far. The past 5 demand samples are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], and the demand in Period 1 and 2 (107, 116) falls within this range. The mean of all available demand samples (112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116) is approx 111.4. The promised lead time is 4. According to the formula mu_hat = (1+L) * mean, with L=4, mu_hat should be 5 * 111.4 = 557. Since there are no concluded arrivals yet, we cannot infer a change in lead time and will stick to the 'default' (promised) lead time. I'll use 'default' methods as the demand seems stable around the historical average.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 414 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Because on-hand is 0, all demand in Periods 1-3 resulted in lost sales. Historical demand data shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the game history [107, 116, 64]. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 105.5. No lead times have concluded yet, so we stick with the promised L=4. Since demand in Period 3 (64) was significantly lower than the historical average, but only one data point, I will use all available samples (8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain stability until a clear regime shift is detected.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. In Periods 1-4, orders were placed (Total 555 units), and we have observed initial on-hand inventory of 0. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 1+4=5. Its arrival will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in Period 4's conclusion is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or loss. Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64, 92] (observed) shows a mean of approximately 104. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the first order is only expected to arrive during this period (to be sold in Period 5), we must maintain the pipeline. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (all available data points including pre-game) to capture the trend while we wait for the first arrival to confirm the lead time.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [107, 116, 64, 92, 88], with an average of 93.4. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, the order from Period 1 arrived following a 4-period lead time, confirming the promised lead time holds. Currently, we have 53 units on-hand and 418 in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, 5). The target is to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. With an average demand of ~93, the required base stock is approximately 465. Our pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 471, which is slightly above the estimated requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the initial behavior, while setting L to 'default' as the lead time observation matches the promise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 106 units on-hand and 315 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on deliveries from Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6). Historical demand samples are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84] (in-game). Recent demand (last 4 periods: 64, 92, 88, 84) suggests a slight downward shift compared to the initial samples. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the in-game behavior while discounting the high initial pre-game/P2 variance. With L=4, the backend will target a pivot (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the high pipeline of 315 units, the backend order will likely be small to account for the incoming stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand samples (including the initial 5 provided and 7 game periods) show a fairly stable mean around 99-100 units (samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and concluded data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived in P5, P6, and P7 respectively). On-hand inventory is 149, with 252 units in pipeline (from orders in P4, P5, P6, and P7). Since the lead time is confirmed and demand is stable, I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=12 (all available demand data points) to capture the variance and mean accurately for the inventory calculations.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Looking at the history (P1 to P8), demand has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 97.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the historical arrival data (at P5, P6, P7, and P8) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 243 units consists of orders from P5 (4 units), P6 (34 units), P7 (73 units), and P8 (132 units). I will use the 'average of all samples' for demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) as there are no clearly defined regime shifts or seasonal spikes identifiable yet. The profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, which targets an 80% service level; the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will manage this based on the provided parameters.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1 through 5. Demand is relatively stable with recent samples (P1-P9) having a mean of 95.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. In Period 9, the order from Period 5 (4 units) arrived, leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 79. There are 377 units currently in-transit (ordered in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). With a lead time L=4, we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 79 + 377 = 456 units. Given the mean demand (~96), 5 periods of demand is ~480 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current stable demand regime and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the statistics are consistent with the promised lead time and historical variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we experienced a stockout (11 units of lost sales) because current on-hand inventory (0) and arrivals are low relative to demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-10). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows moderate variability with recent samples: [88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124]. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 98.4. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock target should be around 5 * 100 = 500 units. Currently, there are 405 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 7, 8, 9, 10). Arriving in Period 11 is the Period 7 order (73 units). Total pipeline + arrival = 405. Setting mu_hat using the recent 10 periods to capture current demand levels (~98/period), and sigma_hat using the same window to provide a safety buffer against the volatility observed in Period 8 (137) and Period 10 (124).

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability with periodic fluctuations. The mean demand of the last 11 periods is approximately 94.6, and the standard deviation is 24.5. The promised lead time L=4 has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1 through P7 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (15 units) after a stockout in Period 10, but there is a significant pipeline (461 units in-transit). The backend's base_stock formula uses q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8, resulting in a z-score of ~0.84. To ensure we cover demand during the review+lead period (L+1=5), I will use the recent 11 periods of history (N=11) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the relevant post-start behavior without including the initial pre-game 'Past demands' which were slightly higher. This helps the OR backend balance the risk of further stockouts against the holding costs of the large pipeline once it arrives.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 12 periods shows a mean of approximately 94.4 units per period (combined with the 5 provided past demand samples). Demand has been relatively stable, oscillating between 58 and 137 in the recent game history. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 55, and there is a significant pipeline of 373 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). Given that L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The pipeline should theoretically cover the expected cumulative demand (~472 units), but since we experienced a stockout in Period 10, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full game history's variability while excluding the older 'past demands' which were slightly higher. This maintains a balanced safety stock against demand spikes.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the last 13 periods with no clear trend or seasonal shift detected. The mean demand of the last 13 periods is approximately 95 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 91.2. The Lead Time (L) has consistently been 4 periods as observed in all arrival confirmations (P5-P13). On-hand inventory is 89, and there are 324 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13 are expected in P14, P15, P16, and P17 respectively). Since the pipeline is roughly a little over 3 periods of mean demand, and the promised lead time is 4, I will stick with the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the recent_N method with N=13 to capture the current stable regime's behavior across the game history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 96.5 units over the last 14 periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by histories of arrivals from Period 1 through Period 10. The pipeline inventory (368 units) plus current on-hand inventory (36 units) totals 404 units. My target base stock (L+1 periods of demand) is approximately 5 * 96.5 = 482.5 units. By using recent_N for mu_hat with N=14 (the full game history), I account for the current demand regime. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on this mean and the standard deviation of these samples, then order the difference needed to reach that level, constrained by the policy cap. I will continue using the promised lead time (L=4) as it matches the observed actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 100 units per period over the last 15 periods (Mean ~99). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (Period 1-11 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 47, and there are 360 units in-transit (orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15). The expected arrivals for the coming periods are 44 (P12), 89 (P13), 106 (P14), and 121 (P15). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will continue to use the promised lead time (L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the initial seed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history (Periods 1-16), demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without strong evidence of a recent regime shift. The mean demand across all 16 periods is approximately 101.4, with a standard deviation of about 22.8. Lead times have consistently arrived exactly at the promised 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, etc.). Current on-hand inventory is 30 units, with 441 units in-transit (reflecting orders from periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Given L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the established demand distribution while allowing for slight flexibility against the earliest startup samples. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate given the perfect stability of the observed lead times.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 6 units, whereas previous demands fluctuated between 58 and 137. This could be a significant outlier or the start of a new regime. Examining the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17), the demands were 104, 115, 118, 61, and 6. The average of these 5 is 80.8, down from the overall mean of approx 94. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current on-hand is 113 and in-transit is 404 (total 517). In-transit orders are: P14 (106), P15 (121), P16 (125), P17 (52). One of these should arrive each period for the next 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to account for the recent drop while maintaining some buffer, and sigma_hat similarly to capture the increased volatility introduced by the outlier.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent drop in Period 17 (demand=6) and Period 18 (demand=87) compared to the long-term historical mean (~100). The average demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 96.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all 14 completed delivery cycles (P1-P14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 132 and in-transit is 298 (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). In-transit units (298) plus on-hand (132) total 430 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean of ~100, we need approx 500 units in the pipeline. Current total (430) is slightly below this. I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture the minor fluctuations while keeping L at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant decrease. Looking at the last three periods (P17-P19), demand values were 6, 87, and 43, averaging 45.3 units. This is a sharp drop from the earlier average (approx. 100 units). To prevent excessive inventory buildup and holding costs, I am shifting to a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, using N=3 to capture this regime shift. Currently, on-hand (210) plus in-transit (236) equals 446 units, which is quite high relative to the new demand levels. The actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by all history from P5 through P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 17: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~45 (-55%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. Previous average demand (Period 1-16) was ~101 units, while the recent 4 periods (P17-P20) show demand values of [6, 87, 43, 82], averaging approximately 54.5 units (a reduction of ~46%). Given the high on-hand inventory of 253 units and 111 units still in-transit, we are currently overstocked relative to this new demand level. The Lead Time is stable at the promised 4 periods. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders the minimum necessary (likely 0) while the stock depletes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $550.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant drop around Period 17, as noted in the Carry-over Insights (dropping from ~100 to ~45). However, Period 21 saw a massive spike of 171. The last 5 periods (Periods 17-21) have demands of [6, 87, 43, 82, 171], averaging 77.8. Given this high volatility and the recent spike, using a short window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is necessary to capture the current regime while reacting to the recent demand surge. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 134, In-transit: 59), so the capped OR policy will likely suppress ordering until inventory levels align with the new parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17. Looking at demands from Period 17 to 22: [6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47]. While there was a spike of 171 in Period 21, the average since Period 17 is approximately 72.6, which is lower than the initial average of ~100 but higher than the 45 estimated in the last carry-over. The 'In-transit' quantity (239) is quite high compared to current demand trends, and On-hand is 87. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current post-shift volatility and mean. This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock to the lower demand level while accounting for the high variance observed recently (range 6 to 171).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 refined: average demand is ~72 with high variance (6-171 range), not as low as initially estimated.

The demand regime since Period_17 has shown high volatility and a different average than the historical start. Demand from Period_17 to Period_23 was: [6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12].

Since my current status shows 'In-transit' units (324) include orders from P20, P21 (both zero), P22 (180), and P23 (144), those 324 units are specifically the 180 + 144 from the last two periods. My current on-hand is 134. Total pipeline + on-hand = 458. With L=4, I need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 7-period average (64) across 5 periods suggests a base stock requirement of 320, plus a buffer for volatility. Given I already have 458 inventory position against a projected demand of ~320-400, I am currently over-inventoried relative to the mean, but the high variance (std of the recent segment is ~55) justifies a cautious approach to avoid stockouts if another 171-level spike occurs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, highly variable regime starting at Period_17.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 17) has shown significant volatility, with values ranging from 6 to 171. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is approximately 63.1. I will set N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (324) and on-hand inventory (78) are high due to large orders placed in P22 and P23 (180 and 144 units). No order was placed in P18 or P20 because inventory was high. The OR backend needs to account for the current demand mean (~63) and the high standard deviation (~53) to avoid stockouts while managing the holding cost of $1/unit. I'm using N=8 to capture the change that started at Period 17.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 17. From Period 17 to Period 25, the demand has been: 6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12, 56, 59. The mean of this recent 9-period regime is approximately 62.6, with significant volatility (std dev ~47). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (19 units) and total in-transit is 336 units. However, looking at the pipeline: orders from P18 (0 units), P20 (0), and P21 (0) mean there are no expected arrivals in Periods 22, 24, and 25. The order placed in P22 (180 units) is expected to arrive in P26. The backend OR logic uses L to determine both the safety stock and the time horizon for mu_hat. I will set L to 4 (promised), and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-mean, high-variance regime. I will use recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the increased volatility seen in this period range (range 6 to 171).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, the Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods (P22 order arrived in P26). Regarding demand, a regime shift occurred at Period 17. Looking at the demand from Period 17 to Period 26 (samples: 6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12, 56, 59, 132), the average is approximately 69.5. This aligns with the Carry-Over Insight from Period 23. While demand is highly volatile (standard deviation is roughly 52), the mean has clearly shifted from the earlier ~100 average. I will use recent_N with N=10 to encompass this entire new regime (Periods 17-26). Currently, we have 67 units on hand and 206 in transit (P23, P25, P26 orders). The 206 in-transit units sufficiently cover the expected demand for the next 4+1 periods (69.5 * 5 = 347.5 approx, and 206+67 = 273). The OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock based on these updated regime parameters.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17. Looking at the last 11 periods (P17-P27), the average demand is 73.27, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 23 (estimated mean ~72). The demand remains volatile (range 6 to 171). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 100, and in-transit inventory is 216 (Orders from P25, P26, P27). Total pipeline (including on-hand) is 316. Given the Lead Time (L=4), we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=11 (the length of the current regime since Period 17) will provide a balanced estimate of the current mean and standard deviation, helping the OR engine navigate the high variance while maintaining enough stock to avoid stockouts during this volatile phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a volatile pattern after the shift at Period 17, with demand values ranging from 6 to 171. The average demand since Period 17 (excluding the current stock-out limited value in P28) is approximately 68.4 units. Period 28 saw a spike in demand (157), which led to a stock-out (on-hand 0). Currently, there are 361 units in-transit, but none arrived this period because orders from P24 and P25 (which would have arrived now if they existed) were small/zero. Specifically, P24 had an order of 0 and P25 had an order of 12. The next significant arrival is expected in Period 30 (from P26 order of 50) and Period 31 (from P27 order of 154). I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift regime (P17-P28) which has stabilized at a lower mean but higher relative variance compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 26-29: 132, 111, 157, 133) indicates that the demand has returned to a high-volume regime. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 133 units, which is a significant increase from the volatile period observed between Period 17 and 25. The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a stockout in Period 29, though 490 units are in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders from Period 24 (if any, though 'ordered=0' was recorded) and Period 26 are expected to arrive soon. To capture this return to high demand while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a N=10 window for demand (mu_hat) to include the recent surge and some preceding context, and N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the high variance observed in recent weeks. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for roughly 133 * 5 units plus a safety buffer to mitigate the current stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: demand returned to high levels (avg ~133) after a period of high volatility (Periods 17-25).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third regime starting around Period 26, following a volatile mid-period slump. Recent demands (P26-P30) are 132, 111, 157, 133, and 81, averaging 122.8. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand), with stockouts occurring in the last three periods (P28-P30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand is significantly higher than the previous volatile period but consistent with the early-game average (~100-110), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime. This provides a mu_hat covering L+1=5 periods to ensure we rebuild stock and satisfy the 122.8 units/period demand while accounting for recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a higher regime since Period 26, following a period of extreme volatility. The current average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 129.5 units. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods, although a lost or significantly delayed shipment from Period 18 is noted (ordered P18, did not arrive by P22/P23, and P24/P28/P29 saw no arrivals or very small ones). Recent stockouts (P28, P29, P30, P31) indicate that the current base stock logic needs to account for this higher demand level and the promised lead time of 4. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current demand mean and variance since the last identified changepoint at Period 26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) using the most relevant data.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third regime since Period 26, following a volatile period (Periods 17-25). Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged 115.7 (132, 111, 157, 133, 81, 163, 33). Although Period 32 saw a sharp drop to 33, previous periods showed high demand, leading to stockouts in Periods 28-31. Inventory is currently stabilizing with 112 units on-hand and 549 in-transit. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as promised. To maintain adequate stock while accounting for recent high demand and stockouts, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this latest regime. This balances protection against stockouts (critical given recent history) with the need to avoid overstocking after the lower Period 32 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-228.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of high volatility. After a significant demand spike (avg ~133 between P26-P31), the last two periods (P32 and P33) have seen a sharp decline (33 and 5 units respectively). This matches the erratic behavior observed in previous 'regime shifts' (like P17-P25). Given the current on-hand inventory of 248 units and a high pipeline (In-transit: 412), there is a significant risk of overstocking if demand remains low. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To manage this high variance and prevent excessive holding costs while still being prepared for a potential return to high demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=8) to capture the recent high-demand phase while adjusting for the current sudden drop. This window covers P26 to P33, providing a balanced view of the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-247.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with Period 31 seeing 163 units while Periods 33 and 34 dropped significantly to 5 and 18 units respectively. This pattern reflects the 'volatility' observed in the Period 17-25 regime, despite the overall shift back to a higher mean (avg ~133) noted in Period 30. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 319 units due to low recent demand and several large arrivals (Periods 32-34). Total pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 323 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high current inventory and recent low demand samples, there is a risk of overstocking if parameters aren't adjusted for recent volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the period since the last regime shift at P26) to capture the current mean while allowing for the high variance. L will remain 'default' as the 4-period lead time is consistent with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly volatile despite the regime shift at Period 26; recent three periods (P32-P34) suggest a potential downward trend or extreme intermittent lows (33, 5, 18).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a confirmed regime shift at Period 26 (avg ~133), the last four periods (P32-P35) have shown recorded demands of 33, 5, 18, and 144. While P35 shows a return to higher demand, the preceding three periods were significantly lower, suggesting either high variance or a shifting mean. Currently, there is a high on-hand inventory of 314 units and 184 units in-transit. With an average demand over the last 10 periods (P26-P35) being approximately 98 units, and the lead time stable at 4 periods, our current total inventory (498) covers standard requirements. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatile regime starting at P26, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, oscillating between extreme lows (5, 18) and standard levels (144, 92). The 'regime shift' at Period 26 indicated a return to a higher mean (~115), but recent variance is significantly higher than in the early periods of the simulation. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (402 units) due to the arrival of 180 units from Period 32 coupled with lower-than-average demand in the immediate preceding periods. The pipeline inventory is 107 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 509) is substantial given the observed mean demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=11 (Periods 26-36) to capture the current high-mean, high-variance regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The high on-hand stock will likely lead the OR backend to produce a small or zero order to minimize holding costs while the backlog clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-Period 26: while the mean has recovered to ~115, period-to-period swings (e.g., P33 at 5 vs P35 at 144) require higher safety stock despite high current on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand environment for chips(Regular) continues to be characterized by extreme volatility and unreliability in the short-term mean. Since Period 26, demand has swung between 5 and 163, with recent periods (P32-P37) showing a sequence of [33, 5, 18, 144, 92, 32]. The average demand across the last 12 periods (P26-P37) is approximately 85.2, but the variance is extremely high. Currently, the system has a high on-hand inventory of 374 units and an in-transit pipeline of 187 units (from P34, P36, and P37). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the current inventory level which already covers over 4 periods of average demand, I am using a conservative estimate. I will set mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the post-shift average, and sigma_hat using the same N to account for the high volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times have been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 26-38) exhibits high volatility following a regime shift, with a mean around 104 units and extreme swings from 5 to 163. Period 38 demand was 100, showing a return to more typical levels after a short-lived dip. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 274, in-transit: 193) which covers several periods of demand at current rates. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and current stock levels, I will use a recent_N window (N=13) to capture the demand mean and variance since the Period 26 recovery. This allows the OR engine to maintain a high service level (z-score approximately 0.84 based on profit/cost ratio) while avoiding excessive over-ordering given the current high stock.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility post-Period 26. Recent demand values [144, 92, 32, 100, 30] show significant fluctuations, making a stable mean forecast difficult. The 'promised' lead time of 4 periods remains reliable as physical arrivals (when they occur) consistently show a 4-period lag (e.g., P33 order arriving in P37). However, we have observed gaps in arrivals (P38, P39) which suggests either the backend is capping orders or specific periods had 0 orders placed; regardless, we have 244 units on-hand and 291 in-transit. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the regime from P26 to P39) to capture the current high-volatility mean (~90) and variance. This N balances the need for stability against the recent series of low demand observations (32, 30) while respecting the broader post-P26 recovery.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 26 demand remains highly volatile (range 5-163) with an average near 90 units, significantly lower than the pre-Period 17 average of ~100 but higher than the P17-P25 dip.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (Period 31-40 range: 5-163). In Period 40, demand was 139, following a low of 30 in Period 39. Despite the volatility, the average demand since the Period 26 shift is approximately 84 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 208, and there are 197 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high volatility noted in carry-over insights, I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods (covering the post-Period 26 regime) to capture the current mean while maintaining a robust sigma_hat to account for the frequent large swings. The lead time L is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains highly volatile post-Period 26, with recent demand samples (P38-P41) being 100, 30, 139, and 89. This averages approximately 89.5 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (203) and significant in-transit inventory (268), the pipeline is currently well-stocked to handle the 5-period horizon (L+1). However, historical volatility (range 5-163) necessitates a mu_hat and sigma_hat that prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing the holding cost of $1.0. Given the regime stability since P26 despite the variance, I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the full post-shift behavior (P26-P41), providing a balanced mean and accounting for the observed high variance.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current on-hand inventory is 133 with 347 units in-transit. Demand since Period 40 has been 139, 89, and 76, showing a slight stabilization compared to previous extreme swings, but remaining unpredictable. Recent carry-over insights correctly identified a volatile post-Period 26 regime. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (P36-P38 orders arrived exactly at P+4). The mean demand over the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) is 86.8 units. Given the high volatility observed in the past (range 5-163), I will use recent_N to capture the current mean and variance while covering the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Setting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the entire 'Period 26+' regime to ensure the OR backend accounts for the full range of recent volatility when determining the base stock level.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 171 units with 318 units in-transit. The demand regime post-Period 26 continues to exhibit significant volatility but has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial periods. The carry-over insights correctly highlight the volatility (range 5-163). Analyzing the most recent demand samples (P39-P43: 30, 139, 89, 76, 60), the average is approximately 78.8 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite a missing shipment in Period 34 (ordered P30) which was actually resolved and arrived in P34, and confirmed lead times of 4. We use N=17 (from P26 to P43) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this 'new normal' of high-variance demand post-recovery. This covers the (L+1)=5 period cycle.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the on-hand inventory is 54 with 346 units in transit. Demand since Period 26 (the start of the current regime) has averaged approximately 87 units per period, but volatility remains extremely high with a range of 5 to 163. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from Periods 39 and 40). To account for the high variance in the current regime and prevent stockouts like those seen around Period 30, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 19 most recent periods (starting from the regime shift at Period 26). This balances the need to capture the current mean while weighting the significant volatility (sigma) observed in current performance. The inventory position (On-hand 54 + In-transit 346 = 400) is robust against my projected (L+1) demand of ~435 units, and these parameters will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate safety stock for the final 5 periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing regular chips with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since the demand regime shift at Period 26, the demand has been highly volatile, though recent periods show a slightly more stable mean. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is approximately 82.5 units with a standard deviation around 35 units. Current on-hand inventory is 137, and in-transit inventory is 338 (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45). With the game ending at Period 50, we must ensure we cover demand for the remaining 4 periods (as P46 order arrives at P50) without accumulating excessive holding costs that can't be recovered by sales beyond the horizon. Using a recent_N of 10 for both demand and volatility captures the current volatile regime correctly. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on these inputs, and given the high pipeline (338), the order will be appropriately moderated by the backend's capped policy to avoid over-ordering at the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand regime post-P26 stabilized with a mean of ~83 and std dev of ~35 over the last 10 periods, though intra-period volatility remains high.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=1, arrived=85 units (ordered on Period 42, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=222, demand=18, sold=18, ending on-hand inventory=204
Daily Profit: $72.00, Daily Holding Cost: $204.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-132.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47, the on-hand inventory is high at 204 units, providing substantial buffer against the current demand mean. The post-P26 demand regime remains stable with a mean of approximately 83.3 units and a standard deviation of 44.5 over the last 20 periods (P27-P46), which covers the most recent stable phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), the primary objective shifts from maintaining a large pipeline to minimizing terminal holding costs while satisfying final demand. The total inventory (On-hand 204 + In-transit 254 = 458) is far in excess of the expected demand for the remainder of the game (~83 x 4 = 332). Consequently, I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the last 20 periods to reflect the stabilized mean and allow the backend's capped policy to naturally phase out unnecessary ordering to avoid excessive ending inventory.

Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $249.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-153.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current inventory position is very high: 249 units on-hand and 241 units in-transit, totaling 490 units. Demand since Period 26 has stabilized at an average of ~83 units per period, with recent demand being even lower (Avg P44-P47 = 60). Given that only 3 decision periods remain (P48, P49, P50) and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is after the game ends. Therefore, my primary goal is to avoid unnecessary holding costs while satisfying the remaining demand using current inventory. With 490 units available and only ~166-250 units of demand expected for the final two periods (which actually occur before any new order can arrive), the inventory is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the post-shift regime (Period 26 onwards), but the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or minimal ordering because on-hand + pipeline inventory far exceeds the calculated base stock for the remaining time horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $674.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The demand post-Period 26 remains highly volatile. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), mean demand is approximately 84.9 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~83 units. However, the most recent period (P48) saw a significant demand surge to 192 units, the highest in the recorded history. This confirms that the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is prone to tail risk. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. With 94 units on hand and 209 units in transit (ordered in P45-P48), our pipeline is healthy. Given the extreme volatility and the recent spike, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 periods (covering the stabilized regime) and sigma_hat using the same period to capture the significant variance. L will be kept at 'default' (promised lead time of 4).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Post-P26 volatility persists with high-demand spikes (P48 demand = 192), reinforcing the need for recent_N (N=10) to capture both the shifted mean (~85) and the elevated variance.

Daily Profit: $728.00, Daily Holding Cost: $59.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $669.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows continued high volatility but a clear resurgence in high-demand periods (P48: 192, P49: 182). Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the mean demand is approximately 97.8 units, which is higher than the previous estimate of ~83, driven by these recent spikes. The standard deviation over this period is approximately 58.7, reflecting the extreme swings from 18 to 192. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With 59 units on hand and 237 in transit, the pipeline inventory is 296. A recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture this latest 'high-volatility/high-mean' regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand dip. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand mean shifted upward again in the last 10 periods (avg ~98) compared to the P35-P45 period, primarily due to recent high-demand spikes (P48-P49 > 180).
