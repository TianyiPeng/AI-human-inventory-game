Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My strategy is to establish a baseline using the 5 periods of historical demand provided (112, 97, 116, 138, 94). The mean of this history is 111.4 units per period. Since the lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The total expected demand over this horizon is approximately 111.4 * 5 = 557. To allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock and manage the initial order, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, which will utilize all available historical data and the promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 141 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect them to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0 and we have already missed 107 units of demand in Period 1 because starting inventory was 0. The historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the new Period 1 demand of 107 suggests a stable mean around 110. I will use the 'default' lead time (promised L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the baseline. mu_hat will target (1+L) * mean demand. With L=4, mu_hat effectively covers 5 periods of demand (~550 units).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116] (Period 1 and 2), yielding a stable mean around 111 units. The promised lead time (L) is 4. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and in Period 2, we ordered 137 units; these are currently in-transit (Total in-transit: 278). Since the lead time is 4, we don't expect the Period 1 order to arrive until the end of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because we started with 0 inventory. To ensure future coverage, the base stock formula should account for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 (5 pre-game + 2 game samples) to capture the stable demand mean and variance while covering the lead time period.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totalling 414 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for periods 1-3. Demand for the last 5 historical samples provided was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111), and the demand observed during the first 3 periods of play was [107, 116, 64]. The drop to 64 in Period 3 is a bit unusual but not yet confirmed as a regime shift. I will use a larger N for mu_hat to smooth out this recent fluctuation while the system waits for the initial pipeline to arrive. L remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no inventory has arrived yet. The historical demand for the last 5 samples is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64, 92] (in-game), totaling 9 samples. The mean demand is approximately 104 units. Since there are no confirmed arrivals yet, we cannot infer an actual lead time shift, so we stick to the promised L=4. I will use the last 5 samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while waiting for the first shipment to land.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the actual lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (Order from P1 arrived in P5). Historical demand for the last 10 periods (including pre-game data) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88]. The mean demand of these 10 samples is 102.4 with a standard deviation of 20.3. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters will use all available history (N=10) as there is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift. On-hand is 53 and in-transit is 414. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a base stock that accounts for the pipeline of ~4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory situation is stabilizing now that shipments from the initial periods are arriving. We have 106 units on hand and 360 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84] reflects a mean of approximately 101. The most recent 5 periods (P2-P6 conclude) show a lower mean of 88.8 compared to the earlier samples. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to capture this slight downward trend in the product's regular demand cycle. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4 as it matches observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 12 periods (including pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and game history [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93]) shows a mean of approximately 100.08 units per period. The confirmed lead time L is 4 periods, meaning we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The target pipeline inventory (base stock) should be approximately 5 * 100 = 500 units. Currently, On-hand (149) + In-transit (238) = 387 units. There is an order from Period 4 (141 units) expected to arrive in Period 8's resolution phase (which we will see in Period 9's start). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 covers the entire available history to establish a stable mean while acknowledging the confirmed lead time. The service level (q) is 0.8 (4 / (4+1)), which the OR backend will use to calculate the safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1-4). Current demand shows a slight uptick in the most recent period (137 vs an average of ~97.6), but no sustained regime shift is confirmed yet. The inventory at hand (153) plus in-transit (229) totals 382. With an average demand of approximately 98 units per period and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, the required stock is around 490 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture all available data since the game began, which helps smooth out the recent high demand while acknowledging it. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for consistency. Lead time is kept at the default promised value of 4 since the observed lead times match exactly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of past concludes shows orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. The order from P5 was 0 units, so P9 correctly shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the lead time is stable at 4. Demand over the last 9 periods has been [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78], with a mean of ~95.4 and std dev of ~21.2. No significant regime shift is detected yet (recent high of 137 followed by 78 suggesting volatility rather than a trend). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate the confirmed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the observed demand distribution since the start. Currently, on-hand (75) + in-transit (364) = 439 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods, which is approximately 95.4 * 5 = 477 units. The system will order to bridge this gap.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, though it shows some fluctuation with a mean around 102 units over the past 10 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10 all showed a lead time of exactly 4). While Period 9 saw no arrival, this is consistent with the order gap in Period 5. The total in-transit units (361) plus current on-hand inventory (34) equals 395, which covers roughly 3.9 periods of demand at the average rate. Given the 1-period observation delay and the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that covers approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is fluctuating between 58 and 137 units; the most recent demand (Period 11) was 58, but we stocked out (on-hand 0). Inventory Reconciliation: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 483 units. However, looking at the 'conclude' messages: Period 8 order (132 units) was expected to arrive in Period 12 (L=4), but the Period 11 conclude shows a stockout. Period 12 arrives (orders from P8) are not yet visible. History confirms a reliable lead time of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). Demand Analysis: The average demand over the last 11 periods is ~94 units. There is no evidence of a regime shift, so I will use a recent window (N=11) to stabilize the mu_hat and sigma_hat against the stockout effect in Period 11. Parameters are set to ensure the (L+1)=5 period pipeline covers expected demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 40 units with 388 units in transit. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P1-P4, P6-P8). Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent 12 periods averaging 94.4 units per period (range 58-138). One stockout occurred in Period 11 due to low on-hand inventory when a small order (14 units) arrived. Currently, orders from Period 9 (135 units), Period 10 (80 units), Period 11 (136 units), and Period 12 (37 units) are in transit. The Period 9 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 13. Given the Lead Time (L) of 4, the base stock targets demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Demand appears stable without clear regime shifts, so using default calculation methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the full historical variability, while maintaining L at the promised/confirmed value of 4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 95 units per period over the last 13 periods. Period 11 saw a stockout due to a small delivery from Period 7, but the system has since recovered following arrivals from Periods 8 and 9. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4 as it matches the observed actual performance exactly.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with a mean around 102 units over the past 14 periods. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=14) to capture the current demand level while ignoring the pre-game history which had slightly higher values. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N (N=14) to capture recent volatility. All orders from periods 1-4 and 6-10 have arrived with a lead time of 4. There is no evidence of lost shipments or significant regime shifts that warrant moving away from the default lead time measurement or recent historical averages.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around 100 units/period (mean of all samples: ~101.4, mean of last 5: 106.6). On-hand inventory is 54, with 353 units in-transit. The in-transit units are expected to arrive in P16 (from P12), P17 (from P13), P18 (from P14), and P19 (from P15). Since the current period is 16, a decision here arrives in P20. Consequently, the pipeline must cover demand for P16 through P20 (L+1 = 5 periods). Data across the full history is robust, so I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable demand mean and volatility while excluding the initial 'past demands' which might be from a different regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with minor fluctuations. Analyzing the last 5 demand periods (P12-P16) gives us [92, 104, 115, 118, 61], with a mean of 98. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages (P1 arrives P5, P2 arrives P6, etc.). The current on-hand inventory is 30, with a pipeline of 441 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, we expect the P13 order (112 units) to arrive during P17. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand distribution while smoothing out the lower outlier from Period 16. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed across all completed arrivals (P5 through P17). Historical demand data and 'GAME HISTORY' demands (P1-P17) show a relatively stable mean of approximately 95 units per period. The most recent demand in Period 17 (6 units) is a significant outlier compared to the previous 16 periods (range 58-137), but it is too early to declare a regime shift. I will continue using the promised lead time (L=4) and estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the recent history to capture the current trend without overreacting to the single outlier. Specifically, I'll use the last 15 periods to represent the steady-state demand while smoothing out the Period 17 anomaly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent decrease. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), the average demand is approximately 77.4 units, compared to the overall historical mean of roughly 98 units. Period 17 showed an exceptionally low demand of 6 units, which might be an outlier or a significant drop. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there is 131 units on-hand and 316 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). To avoid overstocking while demand appears to be softening, I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this recent trend. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent lead time data observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean shows a potential downward shift: avg of last 5 periods is 77.4 vs overall avg of 98.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is high (210) due to several periods of lower-than-average demand. Specifically, the demand mean has shifted downwards significantly over the last 5 periods (mean ~61.0, including a very low outlier of 6 in P17) compared to the initial periods. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 19 noted this trend. The lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory and the goal to balance holding costs ($1/unit) against profit ($4/unit), I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent lower-demand regime using N=5. This will prevent over-ordering and minimize exposure to high holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer based on recent volatility (sigma_hat, also N=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: avg of last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 63.0 vs historical average of 95.7, representing a ~34% decrease.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. The historical average was approximately 98.6, but the average over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 55.8 (61, 6, 87, 43, 82), and the last 3 periods average is 70.6. The carry-over insight already flagged this shift in Period 20. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 253 units, and with an 'In-transit' of 96 units (ordered in P17: 69, P19: 27), the total pipeline is 349. Given a lead time of 4, the target should cover L+1 = 5 periods. At the new estimated mean of ~60-70 units per period, the desired base stock is roughly 300-350 units. Since 349 units are already available or incoming, we are oversupplied. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (average 55.8 * 5 = 279) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the new lower demand and volatility, which will signal the OR backend to stop or reduce ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently observed in the history (e.g., Period 17 order arrived in Period 21). The current inventory state shows on-hand units at 151 and in-transit at 27. Demand was 171 in the last period, which is a significant spike after a period of lower demand (averaging ~63 between P15-P19). However, considering the overall history and the recent shift confirmed in the carry-over insights, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent volatility while respecting the lower demand regime. N=5 covers P17-P21 demand: [6, 87, 43, 82, 171], averaging 77.8. L is set to default as the lead time is stable at 4. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N of 5 to account for the high variance observed in the most recent period (171).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility and a general downward shift since Period 16, with a confirmed regime shift around Period 20. The average demand of the last 8 periods (P15-P22) is approximately 76 units, compared to the initial historical average of ~99. However, Period 21 saw a spike to 171, while Period 22 dropped to 47, indicating high variance. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 104, with 207 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22 are yet to arrive). Specifically, we expect arrivals from P19 (27 units) in P23, nothing from P20/P21 (0 units), and P22 (180 units) in P26. Given the high stock and incoming P22 order, the goal is to stabilize inventory against the new lower mean (approx 76) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current lower mean/higher variance regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P15-P23) is approximately 69.7, which is a significant drop from the historical average (~98). I am using recent_N = 9 to capture this lower volume, as it reflects the current trend more accurately than the long-term average. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23 conclude message. The current on-hand inventory (119) and in-transit units (341, representing orders from P20, P21, P22, and P23) are relatively high compared to recent demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target of (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(1+L), and the high pipeline inventory will likely result in a reduced or zero order this period to prevent excessive holding costs. Note that the order from Period 18 (ordered=0) successfully passed through the system, and P19 arrived as expected.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in the lower bracket; the average of the last 9 periods (P15-P23) is 69.7 units compared to the initial 98 unit average.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we continue to manage 'chips(Regular)' with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The demand history shows a significant downward regime shift that began around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 24 is approximately 68.3 units, compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 98.6 units. Despite this lower demand, the 'In-transit' inventory is quite high (341 units), primarily due to large orders placed in Periods 22 and 23 (180 and 161 units respectively). Our current on-hand inventory is 63 units. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. With a mean of ~68, total expected demand is ~340 units. Current inventory + pipeline (63 + 341 = 404) already exceeds this requirement. Therefore, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or minimal ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this lower demand regime (P15-P24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the parameters reflect the current lower volatility and mean to avoid excessive holding costs while the existing pipeline clears.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 75 units over the last 11 periods (P15-P25), significantly lower than the initial historical average of 98.6. The current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), and while there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (371 units), the next significant arrivals (from the P22 order of 180) are not expected until Period 26-27 given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. My parameters are set to respond to this lower demand regime to avoid excessive holding costs once the pipeline arrives, while maintaining a sufficient base stock for the next (L+1) periods (5 periods). I use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower mean and the increased volatility observed during this regime (demands ranging from 6 to 171). The Lead Time (L) remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower mean: avg of P15-P25 is 70.9 units (approx 28% decrease from original baseline of 98.6).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-mean regime starting around Period 15. The average demand across the last 12 periods (P15-P26) is approximately 74 units, which is a significant drop from the early baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 242 units (orders from P23, P25, and P26). Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure inventory covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 12 for demand parameters captures this sustained lower-demand regime while filtering out the higher initial noise. The OR backend will balance the relatively low holding cost ($1) against the profit ($4) using this specific regime length to avoid over-ordering based on outdated high-demand data.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 15. The average demand since Period 15 (inclusive) is roughly 73 units, with the most recent 10 periods (P18-P27) averaging 71.4 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 26 and 27. On-hand inventory is 102, and there is a significant pipeline of 234 units (ordered in Periods 25, 26, 27). To prevent overstocking while ensuring service levels for the upcoming 5-period window (L+1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (from Period 15 onward) to capture the current lower mean and its associated volatility. This period N = 13 (P15-P27) is chosen to focus on the confirmed demand regime shift documented in carry-over insights.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory status is critical: 0 units on-hand and 367 units in-transit. Demand in Period 28 was 157, exceeding previous lower-regime expectations and lead to a stockout. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has risen to approx 103 units, reverting from the lower regime (70.9) back toward the original baseline (~98). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline includes orders from P25 (31 units), P26 (50 units), P27 (153 units), and P28 (133 units). Orders from P25/P26 are expected to arrive in P29/P30, respectively. To account for the recent demand increase and the stockout, I'm setting N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent trend (approx 103 units/period) and N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods (including the low of 12 and highs over 100).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Recent 5-period average (P24-P28) increased to 103 units, indicating an end to the lower-demand regime (70.9) observed between P15-P25.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a higher regime. The average demand from P26-P29 is approximately 133 units, which is a significant increase from the low-demand regime (avg ~71) observed between P15-P25. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in P28 and P29. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent surge in demand (132, 111, 157, 133 in the last four periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture this new higher-demand environment while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 29: Recent 4-period average (P26-P29) is 133 units, representing a return to high demand levels and an exit from the lower-demand period (P15-P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly exited the low-demand regime observed from Period 15-25. In the last 5 periods (P26-P30), the demand values were [132, 111, 157, 133, 81], resulting in an average of 122.8 units. This is significantly higher than the previous 70.9 unit average and even exceeds the initial baseline of ~98. Therefore, I am focusing on the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this new elevated demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical patterns. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 612 units in-transit. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock to meet this confirmed demand surge while accounting for the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: 5-period average (P26-P30) confirmed at 122.8 units, marking a sustained return to high-demand levels compared to the P15-P25 average of 70.9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly returned to a high-demand regime. The 6-period average (P26-P31) is approximately 129.5 units, which is significantly higher than the low-demand regime observed between P15 and P25 (~71 units). The most recent demand (P31) was 163 units, further supporting this upward shift. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand volatility and mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P26, P27, P29, P30, and P31). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been exceeding supply for the last four periods, resulting in lost sales. The pipeline (In-transit: 515) includes orders from P28 (133), P29 (191), P30 (135), and P31 (56). The P28 order (133 units) is expected to arrive during P32 (invisible until P33's start). Setting parameters to recent_N=6 ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current high-demand environment to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from P26-P31 is 129.5 units, compared to the previous low-regime average (P15-P25) of 70.9 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-demand regime starting from Period 26. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 115.7 units. Although the most recent demand in P32 was low (33), the preceding periods showed high volatility with multiple values exceeding 130. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), a high service level is preferred. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this current high-demand regime (P25-P32), which provides a stable mean of approximately 108.5 units, effectively bridging the transition. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-266.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high-volatility regime following a return to high mean levels around Period 26-29. However, the last two periods (P32 and P33) have shown an abrupt and significant drop in demand (33 and 5 units respectively), which may indicate the start of a new low-demand regime or a temporary seasonal fluctuation. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical objective is to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the current high on-hand inventory (286 units). Pipeline inventory is also substantial (371 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To adapt to the recent high-volatility and the sudden drop, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=8, covering the high-demand return through the recent drop) to provide a balanced forecast, and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance seen in the last 8 periods (P26-P33).

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 32: Demand dropped significantly from a high-regime average (P26-P31: 129.5) to a 2-period average of 19 units (P32-P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-331.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant shift. After a high-demand period (P26-P31: avg ~130), demand has dropped sharply in the last three periods (P32: 33, P33: 5, P34: 18), averaging 18.7 units. This indicates a new low-demand regime or a seasonal drop. Currently, we have a very high inventory position (On-hand: 403, In-transit: 236) which is more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for several periods, even if it returns to previous levels. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect this new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrivals (P31, P32, P33, P34).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period_35: recent 3-period average (P32-P34) is 18.7 units, a significant drop from the P26-P31 average of 129.5.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and regime-shifting behavior. After a period of very low demand (P32-P34 avg: 18.7), Period 35 demand spiked to 144 units. This suggests the product may be moving out of the low-demand trough identified in the previous two periods, or is experiencing high-variance noise. With 315 units on-hand and 180 units in-transit (ordered P32), total pipeline inventory is 495 units. Given the recent history of dramatic shifts between ~20 units and ~130+ units, I will shift to a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat (P32-P35 avg is 50.0) to capture this most recent volatility while resisting over-ordering during a potential return to growth. L remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the heightened variance observed in the last four cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly unstable: Period 35 demand (144) ended a 3-period low-demand streak (P32-P34 avg: 18.7), suggesting high intra-regime variance or potential return to the previous high-demand regime (P26-P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. After a significant three-period drop (P32-P34 average: 18.7), demand rebounded to 144 in P35 and 92 in P36. The current on-hand inventory is high at 403 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand even at the higher historical mean of ~90-100 units. There are no units in-transit as the last large order (180 units from P32) arrived in Period 36. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, maintaining excessive inventory is costly. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to incorporate the recent high-low-high demand swings (P27-P36) which averages to approximately 83.7 units per period. Using N=10 for sigma_hat captures the significant recent variance. Since the inventory position is already high relative to demand, the OR backend's base-stock logic will likely result in zero or small orders, which is appropriate to bleed off excess stock and minimize holding costs while the demand regime stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains highly volatile post-Period 31: following a 3-period low (avg 18.7), demand returned to high levels (P35: 144, P36: 92). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility since Period 32. We've observed a three-period low (P32-P34 avg: 18.7) followed by significantly higher demands (P35: 144, P36: 92, P37: 32). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P32-P37) is approximately 54 units, while the peak demand reached 144. Given this high variance, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current volatile regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently Period 36). Current on-hand inventory is high (371), which helps buffer against these spikes, but the pipeline is relatively low compared to past high-demand periods. I am setting L to default (promised 4) and using N=6 for demand and volatility to account for the recent shift and high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed post-Period 31: 6-period demand (P32-P37) shows high variance with values ranging from 5 to 144 (avg 54).

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility starting around Period 32. We've seen cycles of very low demand (avg 18.7 in P32-P34) followed by spikes (avg 118 in P35-P36) and then moderate fluctuations (avg 66 in P37-P38). The overall average since Period 26 is approximately 91 units, but the high variance makes simple averaging risky. Currently, we have a high on-hand inventory of 271 units and 176 in-transit (ordered in Period 37, expected in Period 41). Given the service level target (z*=0.84 for $4 profit/$1 holding), and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline inventory should cover 5 periods. With a mean of 91, target would be ~455. Current total position (271+176=447) is close to this. I will use recent_N (N=13, from P26 onwards) to capture this high-volatility regime and allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for this level of variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 31: 7-period average (P32-P38) is 60.5 with a range of 5 to 144, suggesting a regime shift towards high variance rather than a stable mean shift.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a period of extreme volatility following Period 31, with a wide range of values (5 to 144). The 8-period average from P32-P39 is 56.75, but the variance is unusually high, making simple mean-based forecasting risky. The on-hand inventory is currently high (241 units) and there is a significant pipeline (294 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the fact that we have enough stock (on-hand + in-transit = 535) to cover more than 9 periods of average demand (535 / 56.75 \u2248 9.4), which is well beyond the L+1 window of 5 periods, the objective is to avoid over-ordering and causing excessive holding costs. I will use the recent volatility (P32-P39, N=8) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, allowing the OR backend to adjust for the high variance while accounting for the high inventory level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance phase since Period 31, with values fluctuating widely between 5 and 144. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P32-P40) is approximately 65.9 units, but this includes a very low 3-period dip and subsequent recover to higher values (92, 32, 100, 30, 139). Given this instability, setting mu_hat using a recent_N window that captures this volatile regime is safer than relying on the long-term historical mean. I will use N=9 for demand parameters to cover the entirety of this high-variance period (P32-P40). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. Current on-hand (102) and in-transit (294) provide a healthy pipeline, but the high variance requires a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts during demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed as a sustained regime post-Period 31: 9-period average (P32-P40) is 65.9 units with high variance (range 5-144).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance regime since Period 32. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), demand has fluctuated wildly between 5 and 144 units, with an average of approximately 68.2 units and a very high standard deviation. Currently, we have 189 units on hand and 152 in transit (total pipeline of 341 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (confirmed by the Period 37 order arriving on Period 41). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), and the significant current inventory (covering approximately 5 periods of average demand), I will set mu_hat using the recent 10-period average to account for the current high-variance regime, while ensuring sigma_hat reflects this volatility. The OR backend will likely minimize new orders this period to burn through existing stock and minimize holding costs while the base stock remains covered.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following a regime shift post-Period 31. Recent demand observations (P32-P42) show values ranging from 5 to 144, with an average of 66.8. Given the significant intra-regime variance, I will base the inventory parameters on the last 11 periods (P32-P42) to capture this new 'high-volatility' state accurately. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P37 order arriving on P41). On-hand inventory is 113, and in-transit is 248 (orders from P39, P41, P42). The OR engine will use these stats to navigate the trade-off between the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1) and the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility following the regime shift at Period 31. The most recent demand samples since Period 32 (P32-P43) average 65.5 units, but individual values range from 5 to 144, indicating a high-variance environment rather than a stable single-mean regime. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the Period 41 and 43 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 171 units with 205 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 44 through Period 48 (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we are in a high-variance phase, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 12 periods (P32-P43) to capture this volatility while adapting to the average demand. N=12 is selected as it encompasses the entire high-variance regime post-P31. This strategy ensures the base stock calculation accounts for recent instability without overreacting to the single most recent data point.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance regime since Period 32, with an average demand of approximately 66 units but fluctuations ranging from 5 to 144. In the most recent four periods (P41-P44), demand has been 89, 76, 60, and 126 (average 87.75), which is higher than the early 'high-variance' average (65.9). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to maintain enough stock to cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods) of demand while accounting for this high volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 45, and there is a significant pipeline of 257 units. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=13, covering the high-variance regime since P32) to capture the current mean while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the significant volatility observed in this period to maintain a high service level without excessive overstocking as we approach the game end.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P32-P44 confirmed as high-variance; recent 4-period mean (P41-P44) is 87.75, showing an upward trend compared to the P32-P40 average of 65.9.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high variance post-Period 31. The average demand from P32 to P45 is approximately 68.4 units, but with significant fluctuations (range 5-144). Over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), the average demand is 84.6 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P37, P39, and P41 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), although there are 373 units in-transit. To ensure sufficient coverage for the remaining 5 periods of the game given the high volatility and current stockout risk, I am selecting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the latest upward demand trend) and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 (capturing the high-variance regime since P32), with L set to the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P32-P45 confirmed as high-variance (avg 68.4, range 5-144). Recent 5-period mean (P41-P45) is 84.6 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high variance post-Period 31, with values ranging from 5 to 144. The most recent demand regime (P32-P46) has an average of 65.1 units, but with a recent 5-period average (P42-P46) of 70.4 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use recent_N to capture this volatile but generally lower-demand state compared to the earlier high-demand peak. N=15 is selected as it covers the entire high-variance regime since Period 32. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the high variability while avoiding excessive holding costs from the previous high-regime averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P32-P46 confirmed as high-variance: average is 65.1 units with range 5-144. No new significant shift detected in the last 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $136.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-variance pattern post-Period 31, with a mean of approximately 65-70 units but significant swings (range 5-144). The last three periods (P45-P47) showed demand of 72, 18, and 24, averaging 38 units, which is lower than the long-term average of this high-variance regime. However, given the high volatility, I will use a recent window that captures this variance to avoid overreacting to a few low data points. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to balance the recent lower demand with the overall high-variance regime history. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With 136 units on-hand and 330 in-transit, we are well-covered for the next several periods (L+1 = 5), so the OR backend will likely moderate ordering to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the high variance (sigma_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $752.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance regime since Period 31, with a recent spike to 192 units in Period 48 causing a stockout. The mean demand of the last 17 periods (P32-P48) is approximately 73 units, but significantly higher peaks occur. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 278 units in-transit (due to arrive in installments over the next 4 periods), and only 2 periods remaining in the simulation, I will set parameters to ensure demand coverage for the final horizon. I'll use a recent window (N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime while acknowledging the recent high demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains high-variance post-Period 31: average demand is 72.8 units (P32-P48) with a wide range (5-192). Period 48 saw a significant peak (192), confirming the continued risk of stockouts during high-variance streaks.

Daily Profit: $600.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $600.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile and shifted back to higher levels recently. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P45-P49) is 97.6 units, but the individual observations (72, 18, 24, 192, 182) show extreme variance (~177% increase from P47 to P48). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit inventory is 290 (ordered P46, P49). Since we are in a high-variance, high-demand phase (last two periods averaged 187 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this recent surge while accounting for the lower values. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect the high volatility observed since Period 40. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accommodates both the high-demand peaks and the significant variance to prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand/High-variance regime confirmed: Average demand for Period 48-49 is 187 units, significantly exceeding the previous high-variance average of 72.8 (P32-P48).
