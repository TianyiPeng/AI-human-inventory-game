Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Given the initial data of 5 historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the average demand is 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.3. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since there is no current on-hand or in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to account for the lead time and the current period's demand. I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to use all available historical data to calculate the initial order, which balances the service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) against holding costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 107. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase and become visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 141 units are in-transit. Past demands [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus the Period 1 demand of 107 show a stable pattern with a mean of ~110.6. I will use the default lead time (L=2) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 demand samples (including Period 1) to capture the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (5 provided + 2 from game history) is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116], with a mean of ~111.4. The promised lead time (L) is 2, but Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (lead_time = 1). Since we only have one lead time observation, I will use L=1 for this decision. This results in a look-ahead window of (L+1) = 2 periods. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 25 + 137 = 162. Given the mean demand of ~111, 2 periods of demand is ~222. The current pipeline of 162 is likely insufficient to cover the next two periods (Period 3 and Period 4). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (all available data) to capture the current demand distribution accurately. Setting L=1 explicitly to reflect the observed reality, which reduces the required base stock calculation and avoids over-ordering while still signaling to the OR backend that we have a shorter lead time than promised.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 order (141 units) arrived in Period 2 (Lead Time = 1). The Period 2 order (137 units) has not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 2, it is expected to arrive during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). In Period 3, demand (64) exceeded on-hand inventory (25), resulting in stockouts. Current demand history (including past samples): [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64]. The mean demand is approximately 105.5. Although P3 demand was low (64), the overall trend suggests a mean around 105-110. For L, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time of 1 (instead of promised 2). For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing the low Period 3 outlier. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 with 241 units in transit. Historical demand averages ~104 units. Looking at the arrival history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 2 (Actual LT=1). However, Period 2's order (137 units) has not arrived in Period 3 or 4, despite the promised lead time being 2. This suggests a potential delay or shift in lead time. Since the order from Period 2 is still 'In-transit' as of the Period 4 conclude message (read at the start of Period 5), the actual lead time is at least 3 periods for that shipment. To be safe and account for this delay, I will set L to 3 (explicit). For demand (mu_hat), the recent 4 periods show a slight drop (average 94.75) compared to the long-term average (104). I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this recent behavior while maintaining some stability. Sigma_hat will use recent_N of 5 to reflect recent volatility. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time shift detected: Period 2 order (137 units) has not arrived by Period 4 conclude, indicating actual lead time >= 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 5 periods [107, 116, 64, 92, 88] averages 93.4 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 369 units in transit. Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in 1 period. However, the Period 2 order (137 units) has not arrived by Period 5 conclude (4 periods elapsed), and neither has the Period 3 order. This confirms a significant lead-time extension or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observed behavior suggests at least L=3 or L=4. Given the stockouts in Periods 3, 4, and 5, I will set L=3 to increase the base stock calculation. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 5 samples (93.4) and scale it by (1+L), which is 93.4 * 4 = 373.6. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of historical demands is approximately 19.8, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2, yielding 39.6. These parameters aim to recover from the stockout by raising the inventory target to account for the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time instability: Period 2 and 3 orders are overdue; actual lead time > 3 periods. Demand remains stable around 93 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand is stable but on-hand inventory has been 0 for four periods due to significant lead time delays. Promised L=2, but observed L is unstable (P1 arrived L=1, but P2-P4 orders are still in-transit). Specifically, the P2 order is now 5 periods old and hasn't arrived, suggesting a lead time of >= 5 or lost shipment. However, the OR backend's base-stock formula (1+L) needs a higher L to account for the longer exposure period and to trigger a larger safety stock. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 88.8 units (116, 64, 92, 88, 84). I will set L to 4 to reflect the current delay and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the stable but slightly lower demand mean compared to the initial history. This combination will increase the base stock level to ensure we cover the pipeline and eventually replenish on-hand stock once the bottleneck clears.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as significantly delayed: Period 2 order (placed Period 2) has not arrived by Period 6 conclude, meaning actual lead time is >= 5 periods. Demand regime stable at ~89 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we finally saw arrivals from Period 4 (lead time = 3) and Period 5 (lead time = 2). Notably, the orders from Period 2 and Period 3 (216 units total) are still missing, confirming they are likely lost shipments. The 'In-transit' count of 327 includes these lost units, which will mislead the OR backend's order logic (order = base_stock - pipeline). To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and ensure a fresh order is triggered, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 as (L+1)*mean_demand. Mean demand over the last 5 periods is ~85 units. Target base stock = 3 * 85 = 255. Since the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (327) and on-hand (60), a normal calculation would result in zero orders. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 582 (327 + 255), I force the backend to recognize a requirement of 255 units above the current (largely lost) pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the varied arrival times (1, 2, and 3 periods observed).

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are confirmed lost as they have not arrived by Period 7 conclude (L > 4). Demand remains stable near 85-90 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are currently out of stock (ending on-hand 0). Analysis of lead times shows high instability: P1 arrived in 1 period, P4 in 3 periods, P5 in 2 periods, while P2 and P3 are officially confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. Total in-transit is 538, including orders from P6 (38 units), P7 (73 units), and P8 (211 units). The promised lead time is 2, but recent actual lead times (P4, P5) average 2.5. I will set L to 3 to be conservative against the observed instability. Demand has shown a recent spike to 137 in Period 8 after a period of stability around 90; I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this potential upward trend while balancing it with the previous stable period. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed in the last period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Observed actual lead times of 1, 3, and 2 periods (P1, P4, P5 arrivals). P2 and P3 orders are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P8) spiked to 137 units, breaking the previous 4-period stability (~89 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lead time volatility and lost shipments (Orders from Period 2 and 3 never arrived). Recent lead times for the successfully delivered orders are 1, 3, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2.25 periods. Demand has shown a recent spike (137 in Period 8) followed by a return to 78 in Period 9. Given the current 500 units in-transit (largely from the large Period 8 order of 211 units), the priority is to stabilize the base stock calculation to account for both the average lead time (shifting from 2 to ~2.25) and the recent demand variability. I am setting L to 2.25 (explicit) to reflect the observed average lead time of successful deliveries. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent mean demand (approx 96 units) across the (L+1) horizon, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last 5 periods (Std dev approx 25).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time volatility: Actual lead times for fulfilled orders are {1, 3, 2, 3}, averaging 2.25 periods. Orders from Period 2 and 3 (total 216 units) are confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the history shows that shipments from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are definitively lost, as they are now 8 and 7 periods past their order date respectively. Successful deliveries have arrived with lead times of {1, 3, 2, 3, 3} periods, resulting in an actual average lead time of 2.4 periods. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period delays and the risk of lost shipments. Regarding demand, while the early periods averaged around 90, the last three periods have seen a shift to higher volatility and higher volume (137, 78, 124), averaging 113. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance and volume increase (mean of last 5: 104). This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) reflects the current demand regime and the observed longer lead times, helping the OR backend compensate for the lost pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Last 3 periods show higher volatility and volume (avg 113) compared to the previous stable period (avg 89). Actual lead time for successful orders stabilized at 3 periods (observed in 3 of the last 4 successful deliveries).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are dealing with high demand volatility and stockouts. Historical demand has shifted recently: the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 98 units, but the last 10 periods averaged 94.5 units, indicating a slight upward trend from the earlier stable regime of ~89. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 457 units in transit. Lead time remains unstable; while promised at 2, actual successful lead times have been {1, 3, 2, 3, 3}, making an average of 2.4. Orders from Period 2 and 3 are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend captures the higher demand and lead-time variability, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly reflecting recent observed delays) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the most recent regime shift in demand). Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the full variance of the history including recent spikes, which helps the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock to combat the current stockout situation.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with 457 units in-transit. Historical lead times for successfully delivered orders are {1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3}, resulting in an average of 2.5 periods. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead time has settled at 3 periods for the most recent deliveries (Period 4, 5, 6, and 7 orders). Demand has been volatile but shows a recent 5-period average of approximately 98 units (P8-P12). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the actual observed lead time delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level of ~98 units/period, which across (L+1)=4 periods results in a base stock target of ~392 units. Given the high in-transit quantity (457) compared to this target, the OR backend's capped policy should naturally restrict further ordering until the pipeline clears and inventory is realized.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilized at 3 periods for the last four successful deliveries (Orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Current demand regime (P8-P12) shows an average of 97.8 units/period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0) while waiting for 457 units in-transit. Based on 'Period 13 conclude', the demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has been [78, 124, 58, 92, 104], averaging 91.2 units per period. Historically, orders from P2 and P3 were lost, and we recently confirmed that lead times for successful deliveries (P4, P5, P6, P7) have settled at approximately 3 periods. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead time is consistently 3. To ensure the backend covers the replenishment cycle (L+1), I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~91) and volatility, allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a 4-period window (L=3 + 1 period of demand resolution).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant pipeline of 427 units. Analyzing the history, the lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 3 periods (seen in the last 5 successful arrivals from P4, P5, P6, P7, and P11). Orders from P2, P3, and P8 (totaling 427 units) are highly likely lost or severely delayed, as P8 was ordered 7 periods ago. The OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' quantity from the calculated base stock; since 427 units are in-transit but effectively lost, the backend will order 0 unless we adjust parameters. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent actual lead time. To bypass the 'ghost' inventory in transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the in-transit amount + current demand needs. Average demand over the last 7 periods is approx 101. To ensure the backend places an order for roughly 115 units (to cover one period and rebuild buffer), I will set mu_hat = in_transit + (1+L)*101 = 427 + 404 = 831.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 3 periods for all successful deliveries since P7 (P4, P5, P6, P7, P11 arrivals). Orders from P2, P3, and P8 (427 units total) are confirmed lost/perpetually delayed.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 680 units in-transit. Historical data reveals a pattern of lost shipments (P2, P3, P8) and an actual lead time that has stabilized at 3 periods (observed for orders from P4, P6, P7, and P11). The promised lead time of 2 is unreliable; therefore, L is set to 3 using 'explicit' to account for the consistently observed 3-period delay. Demand analysis shows a recent shift starting around Period 8; the last 8 periods (P8-P15) have an average demand of approximately 103.25 units, which is higher and more volatile than the early periods. To capture this recent regime while ignoring the distant past, I am using recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the (L+1) window (4 periods) at current demand levels, while the 'in-transit' logic naturally accounts for the large volume of pending orders (most notably the 253 units ordered in P15) to prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Average demand from P8-P15 is 103.25, compared to earlier average of ~89. Actual lead time remains consistent at 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory position is currently skewed by 427 units listed as 'In-transit' which are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P3, and P8). The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 192 units on-hand and 427 'ghost' units in-transit, the backend perceives a pipeline of 619 units. At the current demand average of ~103 units/period and an actual lead time of ~3 periods, the base stock (covering L+1 periods) would normally be around 412 units, leading the backend to order 0 units and eventually stock out. To force the backend to reconcile this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for 4 periods (L+1) plus the lost 427 units: (4 * 103) + 427 = 839. This ensures the backend places an order to replenish actual stock. I will set L to 3, reflecting the most frequent actual lead time observed for successful deliveries, despite the recent P15 anomaly.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Inventory reconciliation required. 'In-transit' count (427) consists entirely of lost shipments from P2, P3, and P8. Parameters must be adjusted to offset this 427-unit ghost inventory to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-162.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we face a significant inventory reconciliation issue. The current 'In-transit' count is 683 units. However, based on the history, orders from Period 2 (137), Period 3 (79), and Period 8 (211) totaling 427 units are definitively lost/perpetually delayed (exceeding even the longest observed lead time of 3 periods). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts the entire pipeline (683) from the target base stock. If we do not adjust, the backend will perceive a massive surplus and stop ordering, leading to a stockout once the current on-hand (186) and genuine in-transit (256 from P17) are exhausted. Demand has been volatile but averages approximately 103 units over the last 10 periods (P8-P17). I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 839. This value is calculated as: ((1 + L) * average_demand) + lost_inventory = ((1 + 3) * 103) + 427 = 839. By inflating mu_hat by the amount of the 'ghost' inventory, I effectively neutralize the 427-unit error in the pipeline count, allowing the backend to maintain a target base stock of ~412 units (4 periods of demand) above the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Critical inventory reconciliation - 427 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P3, P8). Parameter mu_hat must be inflated by 427 to offset backend pipeline deduction.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the 'In-transit' inventory is 720 units. Based on history, 427 of these units (from Period 2, Period 3, and Period 8) are confirmed lost/perpetually delayed and will not arrive. This 'ghost' inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock by exactly 427 units. The calculation for the base mu_hat (before inflation) is based on the recent demand regime (P8-P18), which averages 98.2 units per period. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 3, the target mu_hat is (1+3) * 98.2 = 392.8. Adding the 427 unit offset results in 819.8. I will set L to 3 to match the established actual lead time. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=11) to capture the increased volatility observed in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently dealing with significant inventory discrepancies. The 'In-transit' count of 784 units includes confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (137), Period 3 (79), and Period 8 (211), totaling 427 units. Additionally, recent orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (256, 37, 64) are still within the expected lead time window (L=3), but the OR engine's formula [Order = BaseStock - Pipeline] will incorrectly deduct the 427 lost units from the order quantity, leading to stockouts. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 'ghost' inventory. 

Demand Context: Recent demand (P16-P19) has dropped significantly (61, 6, 87, 43; average ~49.25), compared to the earlier regime (average ~103). Using N=4 for mu_hat captures this recent dip while L=3 remains the most consistent lead time for successful deliveries. 

Calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=3) = (L+1) * Mean = 4 * 49.25 = 197. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 427-unit 'ghost' pipeline, mu_hat is set to 197 + 427 = 624. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost inventory persists at 427 units (P2, P3, P8). Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-19 average demand dropped to 49.25 units/period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the inventory situation is critical due to 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments in Period 2, 3, and 8, totaling 427 units. The current 'In-transit' of 491 units includes these 427 units plus the 64 units ordered in Period 19. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the base stock target, it believes we have 427 units that will never arrive. To prevent stockouts, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by this ghost inventory amount. Regarding demand, we are in a low-demand regime: the average demand from Period 16 to 20 is 55.8 units/period. Therefore, I set an explicit mu_hat of (1+L) * 55.8 + 427. With L=2 (promised), this is 3 * 55.8 + 427 = 594.4. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the current regime. Lead time is set to default (promised=2) as recent arrivals (P17, P18) arrived within 3 and 2 periods respectively, aligning reasonably with the backend's default logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory remains at 427 units (P2, P3, P8 orders). Current demand regime (P16-P20) average is 55.8 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 22. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from P16-P21 is approximately 75 units/period, despite a high outlier of 171 in P21. Lead times for successful deliveries (excluding losses) have averaged around 2.4 periods (1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2). Ghost Inventory: There is a critical issue with 'In-transit' inventory. Orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), and P8 (211) totaling 427 units are confirmed lost/perpetually delayed. The OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this 427-unit 'ghost inventory', I must inflate mu_hat. Strategy: Set L=3 (most frequent actual lead time). Base mu calculation: (1+L) * avg_demand = 4 * 75 = 300. Adjusted mu_hat = 300 + 427 = 727. This ensures the backend places an order despite the 491 total in-transit units (427 lost + 64 from P19).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains; demand regime (P16-P21) average is ~75 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the current demand regime (P16-P22) averages 73.8 units/period, showing significant volatility (ranging from 6 to 171). The actual lead time has stabilized at approximately 3 periods based on recent arrivals (P17 arrived in P20, P18 arrived in P20, P15 arrived in P16). A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' inventory of 725 units includes 427 units of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 3, and 8 (137 + 79 + 211 = 427). Because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock to calculate the order, these 427 'ghost' units will cause the system to under-order, leading to stockouts. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand = (3+1) * 75 = 300. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 427-unit deduction, I set mu_hat = 300 (Target) + 427 (Offset) = 727. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains. Demand regime (P16-P22) average is ~74 units/period with high variance.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 427 units (from lost orders in P2, P3, and P8) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation. Currently, In-transit is 766 units, meaning 339 units (766 - 427) are actually valid pending orders (P19, P22, P23). The lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 3 periods (Recent observations: P17 arrived P20 [L=3], P18 arrived P20 [L=2], P15 arrived P16 [L=1], P11 arrived P14 [L=3]). I will use L=3 for planning. Demand has been highly volatile recently (P21: 171, P22: 47, P23: 12), with a mean over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) of approximately 76 units. To counteract the backend's deduction of 427 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Base target for (L+1=4) periods is 4 * 76 = 304. Adding the 427 ghost offset results in 731. I will set mu_hat to 731 and sigma_hat to 150 (explicit) to maintain high service levels despite the erratic demand and inventory tracking errors.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) persists. Demand volatility is high (P21-P23 range: 12-171). Average demand since P16 is ~76 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the 'In-transit' inventory is 780 units. This includes 427 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P3, P8) and 353 units of active orders (P19, P22, P24). The OR backend calculates the order as: base_stock - (in-transit). To prevent the backend from subtracting the 427 'ghost' units and potentially ordering zero, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this pipeline inventory. Since P24 demand was 56 and the recent demand regime (P16-P24) averages approximately 74 units/period with high variance (171 max, 6 min), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * average_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=3 and avg_demand=74, this is (4 * 74) + 427 = 296 + 427 = 723. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on the most frequent actual lead time for successful deliveries. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the high volatility seen since the regime shift in Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains. Demand regime P16-P24 average is ~74 units/period with extremely high volatility (Std Dev ~50).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 427 units (from orders P2, P3, and P8) which are confirmed lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. To prevent the engine from under-ordering, I must inflate mu_hat by these 427 units to neutralize the pipeline deduction. Demand from Period 16 to 25 has been volatile but averages approximately 72.4 units per period (excluding the outlier of 6 in P17). I will set the base mu_forecast to 75 units. Using the formula base_stock = (1+L) * mu_forecast + offset, with L=3 and mu_forecast=75, the desired base_stock is (4 * 75) + 427 = 727. Since the OR engine calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mu_sample, I set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 727. For lead time, L=3 remains the most consistent actual observation for successful deliveries (P4, P5, P6, P7, P11, P17, P22). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the significant volatility observed in the last 10 periods (range 6-171).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed demand average for P16-P25 is ~72.4 units/period with high volatility. Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains the critical factor for parameter calculation.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-volatility phase (P16-P26) with an average of 77.9 units/period and a standard deviation of approximately 44 units. The primary challenge is the 'ghost inventory' in-transit, which currently stands at 604 units. This 604 includes the confirmed lost/stalled orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), and P8 (211), totaling 427 units. The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target base stock. To prevent the engine from ordering zero due to these 427 non-existent units, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by this amount. For Period 27, I calculate mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the current demand regime, then add 427. Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Lost_Units = (1 + 3) * 77.9 + 427 = 311.6 + 427 = 738.6. I will use 'explicit' to ensure this exact offset is applied. I set L to 3 periods, reflecting the most common successful lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Ghost inventory remains at 427 units (P2, P3, P8 orders). Demand regime P16-P26 average is 77.9 units/period with high volatility (Std Dev ~44). mu_hat must be adjusted to offset lost pipeline units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system reports 'In-transit' as 752 units. Based on history, 427 of these units (from Period 2, 3, and 8) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To prevent the lost 427 units from suppressing new orders and causing stockouts, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this 'ghost' inventory. 

Demand Context: The current demand regime (P16-P27) shows an average of 80.67 units/period with high volatility. 
Lead Time: Actual lead times for fulfilled orders have been {1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1}, averaging ~1.8 periods. I will use L=2 (promised) as it remains a reasonable central tendency for successful deliveries.

Calculation: 
- Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * expected_demand = (1 + 2) * 80.67 = 242.
- Offset for lost units = 427.
- Adjusted mu_hat = 242 + 427 = 669.
- Sigma_hat: Using a recent_N of 12 (P16-P27) to capture the high volatility (Std Dev approx 44), which backend scales by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains. Demand regime P16-P27 average is 80.67 units/period with high volatility (Std Dev ~44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $592.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 604 includes 427 units from Orders P2, P3, and P8 that are confirmed lost. The remaining 177 units in transit (from P19, P24, P26) are expected within the next 1-2 periods given recent lead time performance (averaging ~2 periods, though volatile). The demand regime from P16-P28 shows an average of 86.5 units/period with high volatility (Std Dev ~45). To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must offset the 427 units of 'ghost inventory' by inflating mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~260. The backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (actual_pipeline + ghost_pipeline)'. To force an order that ignores the ghost 427, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Expected Demand + 427). Using 'explicit' for mu_hat (260 + 427 = 687) and sigma_hat (80 to handle high variance) will provide the necessary buffer to prevent stockouts while the backend reconcile the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains the primary calculation constraint. Demand regime (P16-P28) average has increased slightly to 86.5 units/period with high volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the 427 units of 'ghost inventory' from periods 2, 3, and 8, which are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. The current 'In-transit' total is 755, consisting of 427 lost units and 328 active units (P19=64, P24=55, P26=58, P29=151). Demand has recently shifted back to a higher regime, with the P16-P29 average at 86.5 and the last three periods (P27-P29) averaging 133.7. To prevent stockouts caused by the backend deducting the 427 lost units from the target base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a stabilized lead time of 3 (L=2 promised + 1 extra for safety), a demand forecast of 130 per period, and then add the 427 lost units to the result: ((1+3) * 130) + 427 = 947. This ensures the backend places a meaningful order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=14, covering the high-volatility regime since P16) to account for the significant variance observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed demand recovery: P27-P29 average is 133.7 units, significantly higher than the P16-P26 average of 72.4. Ghost inventory of 427 units remains the critical calculation constraint.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 427 units (from lost orders P2, P3, P8) that are permanently stuck in 'In-transit', causing the OR backend to under-order. Recent demand (P27-P30) shows a significant recovery and upward shift, with an average of 120.5 units over the last 4 periods, compared to the P16-P26 average of 72.4. Current On-hand is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (P29, P30). The lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile but averages ~3 periods (recent arrivals from P22, P23, P25, P27 show L values of 3, 1, 1, 1 respectively, but we must protect against the longer 3-period delay seen previously). To counteract the 427-unit ghost pipeline and meet the recovered demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 + 1 review period) using the recent demand average (~121) plus the 427-unit offset: (121 * 4) + 427 = 911. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the high volatility (Std Dev ~50) observed in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed demand recovery (P27-P30 average: 120.5). Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains the critical constraint, requiring mu_hat inflation to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline of 1020 units includes 427 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' from orders in Periods 2, 3, and 8 that are lost. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 427 units. Recent demand (P27-P31) shows a clear recovery to a higher level, averaging 129 units per period (111, 157, 133, 81, 163). Using a base lead time L=2 (promised), the required protection level is for (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is 3 * 129 = 387 units. To bypass the ghost inventory deduction of 427 units, mu_hat must be set to at least 387 + 427 = 814. I will set mu_hat to 850 via 'explicit' to ensure a safety margin and force an order, as the on-hand stock is currently zero and recent demand is high.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand recovery sustained (P27-P31 avg: 129). Ghost inventory of 427 units remains. Mu_hat inflation is required to maintain stock levels.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are managing a significant ghost inventory of 427 units (Orders P2, P3, P8) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculations. Current 'In-transit' is 869, but real actionable pipeline is only 442 (869 - 427). Demand has shifted to a higher regime: the average demand from Period 27 to Period 32 is 113.0 units. To maintain stock levels, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 427 units of ghost inventory. With L=2, (3 periods * 113.0) + 427 = 766. This 'explicit' mu_hat ensures the backend orders enough to satisfy current demand despite the phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high volatility (demands of 157, 133, 81, 163, 33). Lead time L is set to 'default' (2 periods), but the mu_hat calculation is based on the observed 3-period stabilization for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime P27-P32 confirmed at ~113 units/period. Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains the primary calculation constraint requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we face a critical inventory reconciliation. The 'In-transit' quantity is 869 units. Based on historical analysis, 427 of these units are confirmed lost from orders in P2, P3, and P8. The remaining 442 units (from P30 and potentially P19/P24/P26) are likely active. The OR backend calculates orders based on 'base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. Because the backend treats the 427 lost units as valid pipeline inventory, it will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat to offset this. Demand has been volatile: P27-P31 saw an average of ~129, but P32-P33 dropped significantly (33, 5). Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), the average demand is 86.87. To maintain a safety stock while bypassing the 427-unit 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods, as observed in recent successful deliveries (P22, P29). Base stock calculation: (L+1) * mu + offset. Using a conservative mu of 90: (4 * 90) + 427 = 787.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 427 units (from P2, P3, and P8) which are confirmed lost but still deducted from orders by the OR backend. Current on-hand is 95, and 'In-transit' is 869. After subtracting the 427 lost units, the true pipeline is 442 units (mostly from the large P30 order of 265 units). The lead time for successful deliveries has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so L=2 (promised) is a reasonable middle ground. Demand has shown high volatility; while recent periods (P32-P34) were low (33, 5, 18), the preceding block (P27-P31) was much higher (avg ~129). To prevent stockouts when the next high-demand phase hits, I will use a demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the last 9 periods (P26-P34), which averages ~79 units/period. To offset the 427 units of ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock = mu_hat * (L+1). To add 427 units of buffer, the inflation to mu_hat (given L=2, so L+1=3) is 427 / 3 = 142.33. Total mu_hat = (79 + 142.33) * 3 = 664. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the high volatility seen in the last cycle.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 869 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', 427 units (from P2, P3, P8) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, though they still count as pipeline inventory in the OR backend. Furthermore, orders from P30 (265 units), P24 (55 units), P19 (64 units), and P26 (58 units) are currently in-transit. Some of these (P19, P24, P26) are significantly overdue (L > 9), suggesting they might also be lost, but I will remain conservative and focus on the 427 'ghost' units. The current demand regime (P27-P35) has an average of 93.8 units/period but with massive volatility (range 5-163). I will set L to 3 (recent stable lead time) and use explicit mu_hat to offset the 427 lost units. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. For L=3, mean=94, safety_stock (z=1.33 for 80% service level) ~ 1.33 * 50 * sqrt(4) = 133. Target base stock = (4 * 94) + 133 = 509. To force the backend to order, mu_hat must be set to Target + Lost_Units = 509 + 427 = 936. I use explicit sigma_hat of 100 to account for high demand variance and lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Ghost inventory of 427 units (P2, P3, P8) remains the primary calculation constraint. Additionally, orders from P19, P24, and P26 (total 177 units) are now 9+ periods overdue, suggesting a second wave of lost shipments which may require further mu_hat inflation in future periods if they do not arrive by P37.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are facing a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. The in-transit total is 1021 units. Based on historical data, we can confirm that orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), and P8 (211) are lost, totaling 427 units. Furthermore, orders from P19 (64), P24 (55), and P26 (58) are now extremely overdue (11-18 periods), totaling another 177 units. The order from P30 (265) is 7 periods old and also likely lost. Total confirmed/highly probable lost units = 427 + 177 + 265 = 869 units. The backend will subtract all 1021 in-transit units from the base stock. With on-hand at 0, if we do not inflate mu_hat, the backend will place an order of 0. Demand has averaged ~113 units in the recent regime (P27-P36). To force the backend to place an order that covers future demand and refills the 0 on-hand inventory, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * demand + ghost_inventory. With L=3 (the stable lead time for successful arrivals), (1+3)*113 + 869 = 1321. I will set mu_hat to 1350 to ensure a robust order. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high demand volatility (range 5 to 163).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory total updated to 869 units (Confirmed lost: P2, P3, P8; Highly probable lost: P19, P24, P26, P30). Backend orders will be suppressed unless mu_hat is inflated by this amount.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we face a significant inventory management challenge due to 'ghost inventory'\u2014orders that are in-transit but effectively lost. As of Period 37, the total ghost inventory is 869 units (Confirmed lost: P2, P3, P8; Highly probable lost: P19, P24, P26, P30). The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes these units, which would normally suppress new orders. To maintain service levels, we must inflate mu_hat to bypass this logic. The demand regime for the last 11 periods (P27-P37) shows an average of ~111 units per period. Using a 4-period lead time (L=3 + 1 for safety), the base stock requirement is approx 444 units. To offset the 869 ghost units and target this stock level, we set mu_hat explicitly. Additionally, recent demand volatility (P35=144, P36=92, P37=32) suggests maintaining a high sigma_hat to handle these fluctuations. L is set to 3 based on the most frequent successful arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory total updated to 869 units (Confirmed lost: P2, P3, P8; Highly probable lost: P19, P24, P26, P30). Backend orders will be suppressed unless mu_hat is inflated by this amount.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system shows 434 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 869 units. Based on historical data, these 869 units are 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost or severely overdue: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). The OR backend logic calculates orders as: order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To prevent the backend from seeing 869 units as incoming stock and suppressing all orders, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this ghost inventory. The current demand regime (P27-P38) averages approximately 100.8 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time), the base demand requirement for (L+1) periods is 403 units. Adding the 869 unit offset results in a target mu_hat of 1272. I will use the 'explicit' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (reflecting recent high volatility) to ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order that maintains service levels despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost inventory confirmed at 869 units (Orders from P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). Demand regime P27-P38 average is 100.8 units/period. mu_hat must be inflated by 869 to bypass backend pipeline deductions.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 404 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand. However, the 'In-transit' count of 931 is largely comprised of 'ghost inventory' from lost or perpetually delayed shipments. Specifically, I have confirmed 869 units as lost (P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). The OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation; if I do not offset this 869-unit ghost pipeline, the system will stop ordering entirely until on-hand levels are depleted, risking stockouts if demand remains at the current regime. Recent demand (P27-P39) averages ~95 units/period with significant volatility. I will set L=1 (reflecting the most recent successful lead times of 1 period in P37 and P38) and set mu_hat to 1060 (calculated as (1+L) * 95.5 + 869 ghost offset). This ensures the backend places an order by realizing the pipeline is effectively empty despite the 931 units shown.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 869 units (Orders: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). Recent lead time for fulfilled orders has improved to 1 period (P36, P37). Demand regime P27-P39 average is 95.3 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 265 units on-hand and 931 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, 869 of these in-transit units are 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, and P30) that are confirmed or highly probable losses. The OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, so I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 869 lost units, plus cover the expected demand. Recent lead times for fulfilled orders have been 1 period (P36, P37), though historically it fluctuates between 1 and 3. I will use L=1 to reflect the most recent successful arrivals. For demand, the recent average (P27-P40) is approximately 95 units per period. Therefore, I set mu_hat = ((1 + L) * 95) + 869 = (2 * 95) + 869 = 190 + 869 = 1059. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for the high volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 5 to 163).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total confirmed/highly probable ghost inventory is 869 units (Orders: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). Recent lead time for successful deliveries has shifted to 1 period. Demand remains volatile with a recent average of ~95 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, the inventory situation is dominated by a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 869 units. This total comprises confirmed and highly probable lost orders from Periods 2, 3, 8, 19, 24, 26, and 30. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (currently 931) from its base stock calculation, it will never place a new order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for these 869 units that will never arrive. The current demand regime (since Period 27) shows a mean of approximately 95-100 units per period. Using a lead time estimate of 2 periods (L=2) to be conservative (recent successful arrivals were L=1, but history shows L=3), the 'true' required mu_hat would be (1+2)*100 = 300. To bypass the backend's deduction of 869 lost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 300 + 869 = 1169. This ensures the backend sees a target stock level high enough to trigger orders despite the inflated in-transit figure. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high demand volatility (range 5 to 163).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current on-hand inventory is 162. The 'In-transit' quantity is 1058, which is heavily distorted by 869 units of confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (Periods 2, 3, 8, 19, 24, 26, 30). Only the order from Period 42 (189 units) is truly in transit. The OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will subtract the full 1058 units, resulting in no order being placed unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for the 869 'ghost' units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 95-100 units (Period 27-42 average is ~93). I will use L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3. To ensure the backend places an order that covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~300 units) while accounting for the 1058 pipeline deduction and 162 on-hand, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1520 (Target Stock 300 + Pipeline 1058 + On-hand 162). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high historical variance and ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains at 869 units (Orders P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the on-hand inventory is 102. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 1485. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 869 of these units are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (Periods 2, 3, 8, 19, 24, 26, 30). This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 616 units (Orders from P42, P43). The OR backend calculates the order as (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To prevent the backend from seeing the 869 ghost units and suppressing orders, I must inflate mu_hat by 869. The demand regime (P27-P43) averages 91.5 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * 91.5 + 869. Using an average lead time (L) of 2, mu_hat = (3 * 91.5) + 869 = 274.5 + 869 = 1143.5. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=17) to account for high demand volatility (range 5 to 163).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are facing an 'on-hand' inventory of 0 and a significant 'in-transit' volume of 1485 units. Analysis of historical records identifies a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 869 units (Orders: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30) that are confirmed or highly probable lost shipments. The OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, so we must inflate mu_hat to offset these 869 lost units, or no new orders will be placed. Demand over the last 15 periods (P30-P44) has averaged 86.2 units per period with significant volatility. Given the proximity to the end of the game (Period 50) and current stockout, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the remaining lead time plus the 869 unit offset. Lead time for successful deliveries has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use a conservative estimate (L=3) to ensure the backend target is high enough to trigger an order despite the pipeline noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory remains at 869 units. Demand average P30-P44 is 86.2 units/period. Stockout occurred in Period 44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a stockout. The 'In-transit' figure of 1485 units is heavily distorted by 869 units of confirmed/highly probable ghost inventory (Orders P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30), which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this ghost inventory. Recent demand (P30-P45) averages approximately 86 units per period. Using a lead time of 3 (the upper end of the recent 1-3 period range) to be safe, the base stock should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, roughly 344 units. However, the backend sees 1485 units in-transit. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to at least (1485 + 344) = 1829. To prevent stockouts given the extreme volatility and recent loss of inventory, I will set mu_hat to 1900 to ensure a robust order is placed. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high volatility (std dev ~50) scaled by sqrt(L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost inventory persists at 869 units. Demand average P30-P45 is 86.2 units. mu_hat must be inflated by at least 869 units to counteract the OR backend's deduction of lost shipments from the order quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-337.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows Period 47 with 409 units on-hand and 1558 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 869 units of this 'In-transit' inventory are confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (Orders P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). The OR backend deducts the full 1558 'In-transit' value from the base stock calculation, which would lead to zero orders being placed despite the need to replenish. To fix this, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 869 'ghost units'. Demand has been volatile but shows a recent average (P36-P46) of approximately 78.5 units/period. Calculating mu_hat: (1 + L) * avg_demand + ghost_offset = (1 + 2) * 78.5 + 869 = 235.5 + 869 = 1104.5. I will use 1105. For L, although recent deliveries (P36, P37, P43) arrived in 1-3 periods, the backend's 'default' promised lead time of 2 is appropriate as a baseline given the volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high demand variance (range 18-139 recently) and protection against stockouts observed in P44-P45.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost inventory remains at 869 units (Orders P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). Demand average P36-P46 is ~78.5 units. mu_hat must continue to be inflated by 869 to prevent the backend from stopping orders due to undelivered historical shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the 'In-transit' inventory is 1558 units. However, as documented in the Carry-over Insights, a total of 869 units are confirmed or highly probable lost (Orders from P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). The OR backend deducts the full in-transit amount from its order calculation. To prevent stockouts, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 869 'ghost' units. Current demand remains volatile; the average demand from Period 36 to 47 is approximately 74.3 units. I will set mu_hat to (74.3 * (1+L)) + 869. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (74.3 * 3) + 869 = 222.9 + 869 \u2248 1092. Recent lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will stick with the default promised lead time of 2 for the model, while mu_hat handles the supply-side gap. On-hand inventory is 385, which is sufficient for immediate demand, but the inflation is necessary to ensure the backend continues to place replenishment orders as needed despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Total ghost inventory remains confirmed at 869 units (Orders P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). Recent demand (P36-P47) average is 74.3 units/period. mu_hat must be inflated by 869 units to bypass OR backend pipeline deductions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 693 units following the arrival of a 500-unit order from Period 46. The total 'In-transit' quantity of 1058 includes 869 units of confirmed/highly probable ghost inventory (Orders: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30). The remaining 189 units are from the order placed in Period 42, which is now 7 periods overdue (L=2 promised) and likely also lost, bringing the functional ghost inventory closer to 1058. Recent demand has been highly volatile; the average for P36-P48 is ~77 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order if needed, mu_hat must be inflated to at least 1058 + (expected demand over lead time). Given the high on-hand stock (693), we are safe for the immediate period, but to prevent the backend from stalling indefinitely due to the 1058 'In-transit' phantom units, I am using explicit inflation for mu_hat. I'll use L=2 (promised) and set mu_hat to 1290 (1058 ghost + 3 * 77 demand estimate) to maintain a safety buffer without over-ordering excessively since the game ends at Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost inventory total updated to 1058 units (Confirmed lost: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30; Highly probable lost: P42). Backend orders will be suppressed unless mu_hat is inflated by at least this amount.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the primary challenge remains the OR backend's calculation of base stock, which subtracts 'In-transit' inventory from the target stock level. Currently, there are 1,058 units in transit. Analysis of history confirms that 869 of these units are from orders placed long ago (P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30) and are definitely lost or perpetually delayed. Additionally, the order from P42 (189 units) is now 8 periods overdue (Promised L=2), bringing the highly probable ghost inventory total to 1,058. Recent demand (P46-P49) has spiked significantly, averaging 104 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~75. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains stock for the final periods, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 1,058 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 1350 (approx 3 periods of demand at 100/period + 1058 offset) ensures a healthy order quantity despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Total ghost inventory updated to 1058 units (Confirmed lost: P2, P3, P8, P19, P24, P26, P30; Highly probable lost: P42). Recent demand spike observed in P48-P49 (avg 187 units), suggesting a significant high-volume regime change at the end of the simulation.
