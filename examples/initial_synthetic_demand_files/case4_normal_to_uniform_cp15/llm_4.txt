The average of these samples is 111.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message). Therefore, I must cover (L + 1) = 5 periods of demand (Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Total forecasted demand for 5 periods is 111.4 * 5 = 557 units. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To meet demand and maintain a small safety stock (given the spread in the samples), I will place an initial order of 600 units.",

Demand for Period 1 was 107 units, which fits within the historical sample range [94, 138] (average ~111). Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and sales are missed until the first order arrives, I must ensure the pipeline covers demand for the lead time duration (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit is 600 units. Estimated demand for periods 1-5 is roughly 555 units (111 * 5). The 600 units in transit should cover demand through Period 5, leaving a small buffer. However, to maintain a continuous supply for Period 6 (which requires ordering now in Period 2 for arrival in Period 6), I need to account for Period 6 demand as well. Total demand for periods 1-6 is approximately 666 units. With 600 in transit, I will order an additional 115 units to cover Period 6 demand and maintain a safety stock, considering the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4).",

To maintain a safety buffer against high-variance demand (ranging from 30 to 140 recently) and ensure availability through P47, I need to cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1). Total pipeline (0 on-hand + 400 in-transit) = 400 units. Expected demand over 5 periods (P43-P47) at a conservative estimate of 90 units/period (slightly above recent mean to account for stockout potential) is 450. Therefore, an order of 100 is placed to replenish the pipeline and prevent future stockouts as the game nears its end (P50).",

Analyzing the most recent 10-period demand (P34-P43), the average is approximately 69.4 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P39-P43) average 78.8 units. The SKU experienced a stockout in P42 due to high variance, but saw an arrival in P43. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). Current inventory state: On-hand = 40, In-transit = 400 (from orders in P40, P41, P42, P43). Estimated demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) is approximately 400 units (using an average of 80 to account for variance). Total Pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) = 440 units. This pipeline covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods with a small buffer. However, given the high volatility and the risk of stockouts (as seen in P42), a maintaining order of 100 units is placed to ensure the pipeline continues to replenish for the final periods of the game (ending P50). This maintains a steady flow without over-ordering as we approach the horizon.",

Total remaining demand (P45-P50) at a buffered rate of ~100/period is 600 units. To cover the remaining 6 periods and avoid stockouts while minimizing ending inventory at P50, I need to place orders now. An order of 100 units in P45 will arrive in P49. An order in P46 will arrive in P50. I will order 100 units to maintain the flow and buffer against spikes, as the current on-hand (14) is very low and the arrival of 100 units in P45 occurs after the decision phase, meaning P45 demand is mainly satisfied by the P41 arrival.",

Total expected demand for P46-P50 (5 periods) at a mean of ~85 is ~425 units. Current On-hand (42) + In-transit (400) = 442 units. Since the P46 order would only arrive at the very end of the game (likely only available for P50 demand resolution) and the current pipeline already covers the expected demand through P50 with a small safety margin, I will skip ordering to minimize potential holding costs at the game's conclusion.",

With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), orders placed now will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends).

Expected arrivals: P47: 100 units (from P43); P48: 100 units (from P44); P49: 100 units (from P45); P50: 0 units (P46 order was 0). Total inventory available for the remaining 4 periods is 124 (on-hand) + 300 (in-transit) = 424 units. Forecasted demand for the remaining 4 periods (using the ~75 average) is approximately 300 units.

Our current objective is to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (48, 49, 50) using on-hand inventory and the existing in-transit pipeline. Currently, we have 200 units on-hand.

Therefore, the stock available to satisfy demand for the remaining three periods is: 200 (on-hand) + 100 (arriving P48) + 100 (arriving P49) + 100 (arriving P50) = 500 units. Recent demand has been lower (P46=18, P47=24), but even at the long-term high-variance average of ~80-100 units/period, 500 units is more than sufficient for 3 periods.
