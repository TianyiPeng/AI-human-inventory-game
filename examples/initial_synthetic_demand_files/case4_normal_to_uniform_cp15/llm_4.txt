The product 'chips(Regular)' is a staple snack item with generally stable demand, though potentially affected by events/holidays which are not yet apparent from the generic 'Period_1' date. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in time to satisfy this period's demand (Scenario B). To minimize the risk of stockouts while accounting for the fact that I start with 0 on-hand inventory, I need to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 1).

  "rationale": "As this is the final period (Period 50) and the lead time is confirmed to be 0, any order placed now will arrive in time for Period 50 demand resolution. Recent periods (P48, P49) have shown a significant upward demand shift with peaks of 192 and 182, leading to consecutive stockouts against my previous inventory ceiling of 175. To maximize profit in the final step, I will order 200 units to cover this new high-demand regime, ensuring I can fulfill a similar peak if it occurs today while starting from zero on-hand inventory.",
