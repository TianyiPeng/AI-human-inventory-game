Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods is [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit stock, an initial order is required to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). There is no specific calendar date or seasonal information provided to justify a shift from the historical mean. Therefore, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data to calculate the base stock parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) and the promised lead time (L).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability with a mean of approximately 110 units (historical: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94; P1: 107). No significant seasonal trend or regime shift is detected yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 141 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive in Period 3 (P1 + L=2). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the first delivery won't arrive until next period, we continue to experience lost sales. To calculate parameters, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent demand behavior while respecting the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat, N=6 (all available samples) yields a mean of 110.6, so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3 * 110.6 = 331.8. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation is 15.1, so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(3)*15.1 = 26.15. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2 conclude, the order from Period 1 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period (promised was 2). This significantly impacts our pipeline inventory planning. For Period 3, we have 25 units on-hand and 137 units in-transit (ordered in Period 2). Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from pre-game) followed by Period 1 (107) and Period 2 (116) shows a stable demand regime around ~111 units. Since L=1 is confirmed by the Period 1 arrival, I will set L to explicit 1 to prevent the OR backend from over-calculating base stock based on the promised L=2. I will use the mean of all 7 available demand points (avg \u2248 111.4). For mu_hat, using default with L=1 results in (1+1)*111.4 = 222.8. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle volatility based on the full sample set. This setup ensures the base stock (approx 223 + safety stock) covers two periods of demand, accounting for the faster-than-promised delivery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 1 period (observed: P1 order arrived P2).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first three periods was [107, 116, 64], and the additional past data provided was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Calculating the mean of all available demand samples (8 data points) gives approximately 105.5 units/period. The Carry-over insight confirms an actual lead time (L) of 1 period, whereas the promised lead time was 2. However, in Period 3 conclude, we see an order of 137 units placed in Period 2 did NOT arrive (arrived=0), which is unexpected if L=1. This suggests either the lead time is volatile (reverting to 2) or the shipment is delayed. To be safe and ensure the (L+1) demand coverage, I will use L=2 (the promised lead time) as my baseline. Currently, on-hand is 0 and 216 units are in-transit (Orders from P2 and P3). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the average demand of approximately 105 units across (1+L)=3 periods, totaling ~315. This allows the OR backend to replenish inventory considering the current stockout and the pipeline units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0) with a significant backlog of demand (lost sales in P3 and P4). History shows a lead time of 1 period for the P1 order, but the P2, P3, and P4 orders have not arrived yet, suggesting a shift in lead time or potential losses. However, per instructions, I must use the confirmed lead time evidence. Past demands are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92]. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 94.6 units. I will use L=1 based on the Carry-over insight. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. The parameters seek to rebuild the pipeline which currently has 352 units in-transit.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6. Based on history, we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and 352 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, but Period 2's conclude message confirmed a lead time of 1 for the Period 1 order. However, subsequent orders from Period 2 (137 units), Period 3 (79 units), and Period 4 (136 units) have not arrived yet. If lead time were 1, the Period 2 order should have arrived in Period 3 conclude; if lead time were 2, it should have arrived in Period 4. The absence of arrivals since Period 2 suggests either a significant lead-time extension or lost shipments. Because 'In-transit' remains at 352 (137+79+136), the system still considers these units active. Historical demand across the last 5 periods [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] averages ~111.4 units. To handle the uncertainty and the stockout, I will use an explicit L=2 (reverting to promised) and set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the variance of all available data. The OR backend will see high in-transit levels and likely dampen new orders, which is appropriate until the pipeline clears or is confirmed lost.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply disruption: Orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 (total 352 units) are overdue relative to both observed L=1 and promised L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable, with the last 5 periods showing demands of [116, 64, 92, 88, 84], averaging ~89 units. However, we face a critical supply crisis. While P1 arrived in 1 period (L=1), orders from P2, P3, and P4 (totaling 352 units) are significantly overdue. These orders should have arrived by P4 (if L=2) or P3 (if L=1). This indicates a severe disruption or lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and our pipeline (in-transit) is 352 (which covers ~4 periods of demand), the backend will order 0 units if we use the promised lead time (L=2). To force the system to acknowledge the stockout and the unreliability of the 'in-transit' units, I am explicitly increasing the Lead Time parameter (L) to 4. This expands the base stock calculation to cover 5 periods (L+1), ensuring that even with the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, the backend recognizes a deficit and places a new order to replenish the 0 on-hand stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (avg ~89) and sigma_hat to reflect current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption persists: Orders from P2, P3, P4 remain undelivered at P7 (3+ periods overdue). In-transit inventory of 352 units is likely lost or severely delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $329.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the order from Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (actual lead time L=3), which is a significant update compared to the L=1 observed earlier. Orders from Periods 2 and 3 remain missing and are now 5-6 periods overdue; I will treat these 216 units (137 + 79) as lost. Consequently, the effective in-transit inventory is 120 units (ordered Period 7). The current on-hand inventory is 43 units. Demand over the last 5 periods (64, 92, 88, 84, 93) averages 84.2, which is lower than the initial demand. Given the supply instability (L varying from 1 to 3) and lost shipments, I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to cover the longer replenishment cycle. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent demand stability around 84 units per period, while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P4 order arrived at P7 (L=3), following P1 arriving at P2 (L=1). Orders from P2 and P3 (216 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and considered lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the supply situation for chips(Regular) remains highly unstable. We have observed lead times of 1 period (P1 order) and 3 periods (P4 order). Orders from Period 2 (137 units) and Period 3 (79 units) are now 6-7 periods overdue and are officially treated as lost shipments based on the 'Carry-over Insights'. The In-transit quantity of 336 consists of these lost units (216) and a recent order from P7 (120). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (336) from the base stock to calculate the order, and 216 of those units will likely never arrive, we must counteract this by setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am calculating a target base stock to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (promised) and an average demand of ~100 units/period (mean of 8 periods is 97.6), we need approximately 300 units on hand/in-transit. However, since the backend sees 216 phantom units, I will set mu_hat to 516 (300 target + 216 lost) to force a new order of ~120-150 units to replenish stock, as current on-hand is 0. L is set to explicit 2 to align with the promised time despite the volatility, as L=3 would inflate the base stock too much given the cap.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption update: Orders from P2 and P3 (216 units total) are confirmed lost (7+ periods since order). In-transit totals are misleadingly high due to these phantom units.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly unstable. We have a confirmed loss of 216 units from orders placed in Periods 2 and 3. Historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 period (P1 order) and 3 periods (P4 order). The current 'In-transit' of 545 units includes the 216 lost units plus orders from P7 (120 units) and P9 (209 units). Netting out the lost units, we have 329 real units in transit. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been relatively stable (mean ~98 over last 9 periods), we need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. I will set L to 2 (promised) as a baseline, but use mu_hat to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Given the stockout and the misleading in-transit total, I use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current level (avg ~98) while the OR engine subtracts the (inflated) pipeline. To compensate for the 216 lost units appearing as 'in-transit', I am increasing the mu_hat via an explicit value to force an order that bridges the gap between the backend's perceived pipeline (545) and the actual pipeline (329). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~300. Adding the 216 lost units to the base stock target ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 428 in-transit. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', 216 units from P2 and P3 are considered lost. The remaining valid in-transit inventory is 212 units (P9 order: 209, P10 order: 3). Observed lead times have shifted from 1 period (P1) to 3 periods (P4, P7). Therefore, I am setting L=3 to reflect this increased delay. Demand is relatively stable with a mean around 100 units; the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean of 103.2. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for recent demand volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 428 in-transit (including lost units) from the base stock; by setting L=3, the target base stock (covering 4 periods) should be high enough (~400-500 units) to trigger a corrective order despite the phantom inventory, helping to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by P4 and P7 arrivals). Phantom inventory from P2-P3 (216 units) remains in the system's in-transit count.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system faces a stockout with 0 units on-hand. Reviewing lead times: P4 arrived at P7 (L=3), and P7 arrived at P10 (L=3). This suggests a stable actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Orders from P2 and P3 (216 units) are now 9+ periods old and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 457 units includes these 216 phantom units, meaning the real pipeline is only 241 units (orders from P9, P10, and P11). Demand has fluctuated between 58 and 137 recently; the mean of the last 11 periods is ~95. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon (4 periods) while accounting for the 3-period lead time, I am setting L explicitly to 3. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. The backend will subtract the inflated in-transit (457), which is risky, but setting L=3 increases the base stock target to compensate.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed stable at 3 periods based on P4 and P7 arrivals. In-transit inventory remains inflated by 216 lost units from P2-P3.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 120 units. Analysis of recent arrivals (P7, P9, and P10) confirms that the actual lead time (L) has stabilized at approximately 3 periods (with P10 arriving in 2), contrary to the promised L=2. The in-transit inventory of 245 units includes 216 units from P2 and P3 that are confirmed lost (now 10+ periods overdue). Excluding these phantom units, the true pipeline inventory is 29 units (ordered in P11). Since L is effectively 3, we must cover demand for (L+1) = 4 periods. The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 95 units per period. Target base stock = 95 * 4 = 380 units. Accounting for the true pipeline (29) and on-hand (120), the net position is 149, leaving a gap of 231 units. Setting L to 3 and using mu_hat to reflect the 4-period demand window will allow the OR backend to place an appropriate order despite the inflated in-transit count. mu_hat is set to explicit 380 (95 * 4) to bypass the backend's use of the corrupted 'in-transit' figure where possible, or rather to ensure the target base stock is high enough.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular). The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 301, but history shows that 216 units (from P2 and P3) are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is 301 - 216 = 85 units (from P11 and P13). Lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed for P4, P7, and P9). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 124, 58, 92, 104, and the pre-game history average) is relatively stable around 100 units. To account for the 216 phantom units in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must set mu_hat to a higher 'explicit' value. Since the backend calculates: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory, and pipeline_inventory is inflated by 216, I will increase the target base_stock by 216. Target base_stock for (L+1=4) periods at mean demand ~100 is 400. Adding the 216 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 616. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (Ending On-hand: 0). Recent demand has shown a slight increase with the last five periods averaging approximately 100 units (92, 104, 115, and the historical tail). The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P12 and P14), despite the promised L=2. The system's 'In-transit' count of 468 units is heavily inflated by 216 lost units from Periods 2 and 3 that will never arrive. To compensate for the OR backend's unawareness of these lost units and the actual lead time shift, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current demand trend (~100/period), resulting in a target stock around 400. This should trigger an order that accounts for the current stockout while ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently 3 periods (confirmed by P4, P7, P9, and P11 arrivals). Phantom inventory from P2-P3 (216 units) remains in the system's in-transit count, causing the OR engine to under-order unless L or mu_hat is adjusted.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system faces a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of recent arrivals (P7, P10, P12, P14) confirms a stable actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. A critical issue remains: 216 units from orders in P2 and P3 are 13+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. These 'phantom units' are still counted in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' (total in-transit: 468), which causes the OR engine to under-order by that amount. To compensate for this 216-unit deficit and the L=3 reality, I am using the 'explicit' method for L=3 and mu_hat. For mu_hat, the calculation is (1+L) * average_demand + lost_inventory. With L=3, avg demand over the last 5 periods (~106), the base requirement is (1+3)*106 = 424. Adding the 216 lost units to bridge the pipeline gap results in mu_hat = 640. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to reflect recent demand volatility (~110-120 range) and provide a safety buffer.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing a supply chain with a stabilized lead time (L=3) and significant 'phantom inventory'. Orders from P2 and P3 (total 216 units) are over 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. These 216 units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (currently 670), which suppresses orders because the OR engine thinks base stock is covered. To compensate for this 216-unit deficit without manually changing the backend logic, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. Calculations: Recent demand (last 5 periods: P12-P16) shows an average of 98.4 units/period. With L=3, the standard mu_hat formula is (1+L) * mean, which is 4 * 98.4 = 393.6. To bridge the gap created by the 216 lost units, I set mu_hat to 393.6 + 216 = 609.6. I am setting L to 'explicit' 3 to reflect the actual observed delivery speed (3 periods). Sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand volatility (std \u2248 24.5, so sqrt(4)*24.5 \u2248 49).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing a supply chain with confirmed lead-time volatility and lost shipments. Historical analysis shows that orders from P2 and P3 (216 units total) never arrived and are now 15+ periods overdue, making them 'phantom' units in the OR engine's in-transit count. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), these 216 lost units cause a consistent under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting lead time (L) to 'explicit' value 3, as seen in the arrivals of P4, P7, P9, P11, and P14. For mu_hat, the mean demand over the last 17 periods is approx 93 units. Given (L+1) periods must be covered, the baseline mu_hat would be 372. However, to offset the 216 units the OR engine *thinks* it has but doesn't, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 588 (372 + 216). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent demand volatility without over-penalizing for the extremely low outlier in Period 17 (demand=6).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are managing chips(Regular) with a current on-hand inventory of 103 units. Historical data shows demand is relatively stable but supply is volatile. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (P7, P10, P12, P14, P17) consistently show a lead time of 3 periods, with some lost orders from P2 and P3 (216 units) still inflating the 'In-transit' figure of 474 units. This phantom inventory is dangerous because the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 474 units and under-order, leading to stockouts. To compensate for the 216 lost units and the actual lead time of 3, I am using the 'explicit' method for L and mu_hat. Specifically, L is set to 3. For mu_hat, the calculation is (1 + L) * expected_demand. Average demand over the last 5 periods is ~77, but looking at the full history, it averages ~94. Using 95 as a base: (1+3) * 95 = 380. To offset the 216 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I add them to the mu_hat requirement: 380 + 216 = 596. This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the standard volatility across the lead time.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a significant inventory management challenge due to 216 'phantom' units in the pipeline (orders from P2 and P3) that are long overdue and confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights. The current 'In-transit' count of 554 units includes these lost units, which causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes those units are still coming. To compensate for the pipeline inflation, I am setting 'L' to an explicit value of 4 (one higher than the observed stable lead time of 3). This increases the base stock target (covering L+1 periods) without being capped too aggressively by the engine. I'm using mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility (avg ~63), as demand has fluctuated significantly recently (6 to 118). Sigma_hat uses 'default' to maintain a safe buffer against this high variance.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 554 units in-transit. However, historical analysis (Carry-over Insights) confirms that orders from P2 (137 units) and P3 (79 units), totaling 216 units, are lost. Additionally, the order from P13 (56 units) is now 8 periods old (placed P13, now P21) and must also be considered lost, as the established lead time is 3 periods. This brings total 'phantom' inventory to 272 units. The real pipeline consists of P16 (202 units), P19 (80 units), and any subsequent orders. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 272 phantom units, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 (confirmed by P4, P7, P9, P11, and P14 arrivals) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mu_hat calculation: (L+1) * Average Demand = (3+1) * ~94.2 = 376.8. To account for the 272 phantom units and ensure the base stock (base_stock = mu + z*sigma) is high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' variable, I will use mu_hat = 377 + 272 = 649. Demand is relatively stable (mean ~94), so sigma_hat remains at default.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 13 (56 units) confirmed lost (8 periods since order with L=3). Total phantom inventory now 272 units (P2: 137, P3: 79, P13: 56).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system faces an inventory deficit with 0 units on-hand. The current in-transit inventory is 700 units, but a significant portion (272 units) is confirmed lost from Periods 2, 3, and 13. This 'phantom' inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. Recent demand has spiked significantly to 171 in Period 21, though the last 5 periods average 88.8 units. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently for orders from P4, P7, P9, P11, and P14). To compensate for the 272 units of lost inventory that the backend still counts as 'in-transit', I am setting L to 5. This increases the base stock target (\u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302) by including 2 extra periods of demand (approx 200 units), which partially offsets the 272-unit phantom inventory bias without over-ordering excessively. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent volatility and the high demand point in P21, ensuring the target covers the current consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike noted at P21 (171 units), significantly above the 5-period average of 89. Total confirmed lost inventory remains 272 units (P2, P3, P13).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system is recovering from a stockout after a significant demand spike in Period 21 (171 units), followed by a lower demand in Period 22 (47 units). The current 5-period demand average is approximately 82 units. The 'In-transit' count of 700 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 3, and 13 (total 272 units). Additionally, orders from Period 16 (202 units) and Period 19 (80 units) are currently 7 and 4 periods old respectively; since the established stable lead time is 3 periods, the Period 16 order is likely lost or severely delayed. To compensate for the OR backend's tendency to under-order due to these 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I am setting L to 4 (an explicit increase from the stable 3 to reflect recent delays) and using an explicit mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent average demand (approx 85) over (L+1) periods (85 * 5 = 425), then add the 272 units of confirmed lost inventory to 'offset' the backend's deduction of those units from the order quantity. This results in mu_hat = 697.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 16 (202 units) likely lost or severely delayed (7 periods elapsed since order vs L=3). Total phantom inventory now estimated at 474 units (P2, P3, P13, P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we have 134 units on-hand and an in-transit balance of 648 units. However, historical evidence confirms a significant portion of the in-transit inventory is 'phantom' (lost shipments). Specifically, orders from P2 (137), P3 (79), P13 (56), and now P16 (202) are significantly overdue based on the observed stable lead time of 2-3 periods. Total phantom inventory is estimated at 474 units. This causes the OR engine to underestimate the required order because it perceives a much higher pipeline than actually exists. Demand has been volatile recently (171 in P21, 12 in P23). To compensate for the 474 lost units and ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage) using the long-term mean (~96) plus the phantom inventory: (96 * 3) + 474 = 762. Setting mu_hat to 762 effectively 'tricks' the backend into ignoring the lost units in its subtraction logic. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 474 units (P2: 137, P3: 79, P13: 56, P16: 202). Lead time remains stable between 2-3 periods (P21 arrived in 2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand at Period 24 was 56, continuing a lower-demand trend after the spike at P21. Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-2 periods (P21 arrived in 2, P23 in 1), though the historical average remains closer to 3. The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As recorded in the Carry-Over Insights, orders from P2, P3, P13, and P16 (totaling 474 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The current 'In-transit' figure of 618 units includes these 474 units, meaning the real pipeline inventory is only 144 units (the P24 order of 64 and possibly the P19 order of 80 which is 5 periods old and likely also lost, but I will focus on the confirmed 474 first). Since the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit value from the base stock to calculate the order, it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for this phantom inventory. I am setting L=3 to be safe on lead time and using an explicit mu_hat. Forecasted demand is ~90 units/period. For (L+1)=4 periods, base stock should be ~360. Adding the 474 lost units to this to offset the backend subtraction, I set mu_hat to 834. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to maintain a high service level during this period of high lead-time and supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 19 (80 units) is now 5 periods overdue (L=3 expected). Adding these 80 units to the phantom inventory count. Total estimated phantom inventory is now 554 units (P2: 137, P3: 79, P13: 56, P16: 202, P19: 80).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the on-hand inventory is 113 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 789 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments. Specifically, we have identified 554 units of phantom inventory (P2: 137, P3: 79, P13: 56, P16: 202, P19: 80) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory is 235 units (P24: 64, P25: 171). Recent lead times have shown improvement (L=2 and L=1 for the last two arrivals), suggesting a shift back toward the promised L=2. However, the OR backend uses the total 'In-transit' (789) to calculate the order: final_order = max(0, base_stock - 789). To force the engine to order despite this 554-unit phantom cushion, I must artificially inflate the base_stock by setting a high 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand average is approx 75 units (last 5 periods: 171, 47, 12, 56, 59). With L=2, the required base stock would normally be ~225. To offset the 554 phantom units, I need a base stock of ~779. I will set mu_hat to 780 to ensure a replenishment order is triggered to cover future demand, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the actual demand volatility (including the P21 spike).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, on-hand inventory is 152 units. However, the 'In-transit' count of 618 units is highly misleading. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, 554 units are confirmed lost (P2: 137, P3: 79, P13: 56, P16: 202, P19: 80). Additionally, the order from P24 (64 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, making it suspicious given the recent lead time (L) has improved to 1 period (P23 arrived in 1, P25 arrived in 1). Total phantom inventory is at least 554 units, and potentially 618 units if P24 is also lost. The OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (In-transit) from its base stock calculation; if 'In-transit' is artificially high due to lost orders, the system will under-order or not order at all, leading to stockouts. To compensate, I am setting L to 1 (reflecting the most recent successful deliveries) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 2 periods (L+1) at 180 units (90 per period avg) but then add the 618 units of phantom inventory to the total. This forces the OR backend to 'see' a requirement that bypasses the inflated in-transit subtraction. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent high demand volatility (171 at P21 and 132 at P26).

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 24 (64 units) is now 3 periods overdue compared to recent actual lead time of 1 period; potentially lost. Total estimated phantom inventory: 618 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system shows 680 units in-transit. However, based on the history of confirmed arrivals and the lead time logic, a significant portion of this inventory is 'phantom' (lost). The confirmed lost units include: P2 (137), P3 (79), P13 (56), P16 (202), P19 (80), and P24 (64), totaling 618 units. This leaves only approximately 62 units (from P27) as valid pipeline inventory. The recent actual lead time has shifted from L=3 to L=1 or 2 (P21 arrived in 2, P23 in 1, P25 in 1). Despite this, the OR engine's capped policy will see 680 in-transit and refuse to order. To force an order and maintain service levels, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 618 phantom units. The recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~74 units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be (1+2)*74 = 222. Adding the 618 units to this base gives 840. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the phantom inventory problem and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility (~51).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 618 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24). Actual lead time for successful deliveries has shortened to 1-2 periods recently.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system shows 807 units in-transit. However, historical analysis (Carry-over insights) confirms that 618 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24). The only valid in-transit order is from P28 (189 units). If we use default parameters, the OR backend will see 807 units and stop ordering, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am setting 'L' to an 'explicit' value of 0. This reduces the pipeline inventory the engine expects to see, effectively forcing it to ignore the phantom units and place a new order. Demand has been volatile but shows a recent upward trend (avg of last 5 periods ~94 units, with a peak of 157 in P28). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent increase in demand and sigma_hat with 'recent_N' for the same period to account for the volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the in-transit count. The backend OR engine sees 'In-transit: 618 units', but based on historical analysis, all 618 of these units are lost (Orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27). If I use default parameters, the engine will subtract 618 from the base stock and place an order of 0, despite on-hand inventory being only 56 units and demand averaging ~95 units. To force the engine to order, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual forecasted demand to offset the 618 phantom units. 

Recent demand (P25-P29) has averaged 118.4 units. Actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 1 period. Therefore, the required base stock to cover L+1 periods (2 periods) is approximately 237 units + safety stock. To ensure an order is placed despite the 618 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 850 (618 phantom + 232 demand). I set L to 1 to match the recent trend. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a healthy safety buffer given the high demand volatility observed recently (range 59 to 157).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 618 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27). This inventory is considered lost as it is far beyond the recently observed lead time of 1 period. mu_hat must be adjusted upward to neutralize this 618-unit drag in the OR engine calculation.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shows a recent uptick, with the average of the last 10 periods around 98.4 units. More critically, the system faces a severe 'phantom inventory' issue. Out of 837 units listed as 'In-transit', 618 units (from Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27) are confirmed lost based on the recent stable lead time of 1-2 periods. The OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will incorrectly assume these 618 units are arriving and thus stop ordering, leading to persistent stockouts. To neutralize this 618-unit drag, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the 618 lost units. With L=1 and average demand ~100, mu_hat = (1+1)*100 + 618 = 818. This forces the engine to place an order despite the false pipeline data. Lead time (L) is set to 1, as the last four successful arrivals (P23, P25, P27, P28 orders) all had a lead time of 1 period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption with a large volume of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived, yet remain in the 'in-transit' count. As of Period 32, the estimated phantom inventory is 618 units (from Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, and 27). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target base stock; if we do not account for these 618 lost units, the backend will under-order, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 114 units. With a recent actual lead time (L) of 1, the backend targets (1+L) periods of demand. My calculation is: (1+L) * Average Demand + Phantom Inventory = (1+1) * 114 + 618 = 846. I set mu_hat to 846 to ensure the order covers demand while neutralizing the phantom inventory drag. Lead time (L) is set to 1, reflecting the most recent successful delivery (Period 28 order arrived in P29). Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to provide a buffer for the recent demand volatility (highs of 163-171, lows of 81).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and a significant supply chain integrity issue. The 'In-transit' count of 889 units is severely inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived. Based on historical analysis, orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, and P30 (a total of 837 units) are now well beyond the recently observed lead time of 1-2 periods and are considered lost. Specifically, P30 (219 units) is now 2 periods overdue compared to the recent 1-period arrival pattern (P27, P28). The OR backend's capped policy will under-order because it subtracts this non-existent pipeline inventory from the base stock. To force an order, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates both the expected demand for the (L+1) window and a correction factor to neutralize the 837 phantom units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~113. With an estimated L=2, the required base stock would be ~339 units. By setting mu_hat to 1176 (339 + 837), I ensure the OR engine places a replenishment order despite the false pipeline data. L is set to 2 to reflect the promised time, though recent successful deliveries arrived in 1.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 837 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30). These units are considered lost, requiring an upward mu_hat adjustment to offset the false pipeline inventory in the OR engine.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1210 units. However, based on historical analysis, a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived. Specifically, orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, and now P30 (219 units) are significantly past the recently observed lead time of 1-2 periods. Total phantom inventory is calculated at 837 units. This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes these units are coming. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base demand (recent 5-period average) at approximately 83 units. For a target lead time of 2, the expected mu_hat would normally be (1+L)*83 = 249. To neutralize the 837 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 249 + 837 = 1086. Lead time L is set to 2 to reflect the most recent arrival (P31 arrived in 2 periods at P33). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 837 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30). These units are considered lost, requiring an upward mu_hat adjustment to offset the false pipeline inventory in the OR engine.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current on-hand inventory is 24 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 1210 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, there is a cumulative total of 837 units from orders placed in Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27, and 30 that have not arrived far beyond the recently observed lead time of 1-2 periods. These 837 units are likely lost. If the OR engine treats them as valid pipeline inventory, it will drastically under-order. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. The base-stock formula is base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. The order quantity is (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). By setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired inventory level plus the 'phantom' inventory, I can force the backend to place an order that ignores the lost units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 80 units/period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock would be (1+L)*80 = 240 plus safety stock. To offset the 837 lost units, I will set mu_hat to (240 + 837) = 1077. I will use L=2 as the stable recent lead time for successful deliveries (P31 arrived in 2 periods).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1210 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on the carry-over insights, orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, and P30 (totaling 837 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost. Additionally, the order from P32 (5 units) is now past the recent lead time of 1-2 periods. This brings the estimated phantom inventory to 842 units. The OR engine calculates the order as: base_stock - (total_in_transit - phantom) - on_hand. To correct for the 842 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must increase mu_hat. Specifically, mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory deficit. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~88 units. With a recent lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods, the base mu_hat would be (1+2)*88 = 264. Adding the 842 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1106. L is set to 2 to reflect recent successful delivery timings (P31 arrived in 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 842 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32). These units are considered lost, requiring an upward mu_hat adjustment to offset the false pipeline inventory in the OR engine.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 276 units following the arrival of the P33 order (368 units) in Period 36 (L=3). The system reports 842 units in-transit, which matches the total confirmed phantom inventory identified in the Carry-Over Insights (orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, and P32). Since these units are far beyond the recently observed lead time of 1-3 periods, they are effectively lost. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this false pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to neutralize the 842 phantom units. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 82.2 units. With an estimated lead time L=2 (averaging recent variability), the standard base stock calculation would be (1+L)*mu. To offset the 842 units, I calculate an explicit mu_hat: (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom Inventory = (82.2 * 3) + 842 \u2248 1089. This ensures the engine sees a 'requirement' that accounts for the fact that the pipeline is actually empty. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to maintain a high service level given the high demand volatility (ranging from 5 to 163 recently).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-116.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 244 and a massive in-transit pipeline of 982 units. Based on historical analysis and the carry-over insights, 842 of these units are 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost from Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27, 30, and 32). The actual effective pipeline is only 140 units (ordered in Period 37). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this false 842-unit surplus, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock by taking the demand forecast for (L+1) periods and adding the phantom inventory count. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~82 units. Using an expected lead time of 2 (most recent arrivals were 2-3 periods), the demand for L+1 (3 periods) is ~246. Adding the 842 phantom units results in a mu_hat of 1088. This ensures the OR engine (which calculates Order = Base Stock - Pipeline) correctly triggers an order by neutralizing the 842-unit drag. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 10-period standard deviation scaled for the lead time to maintain service levels amidst high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 842 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32). This false pipeline requires mu_hat to be offset by +842 to ensure the OR engine maintains adequate stock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 77 units (18, 144, 92, 32, 100). The most recent lead time was 1 period (P37 order arrived in P38), though the broader history shows variance between 1 and 3 periods. The critical issue remains the 842 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (Orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32) which are effectively lost. The OR engine subtracts this in-transit count from the target base stock. To maintain a healthy on-hand inventory and avoid stockouts caused by this false pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the base stock for a lead time of 2 (Promised L) + 1 (Review) = 3 periods of demand. Using the recent average demand of ~90 units/period, the required 3-period demand is 270. To offset the 842 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1112 (270 + 842). This ensures the backend calculates an order that targets actual inventory needs rather than being suppressed by the lost shipments.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the supply chain remains highly unstable. We have a confirmed 'phantom' inventory of 842 units (orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32) that are currently in the system's 'In-transit' count (910) but are significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this false pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target mu_hat is calculated as: ((1 + L) * average_demand) + phantom_inventory. With L=2, average demand over the last 10 periods (approx 72), and phantom inventory of 842, the explicit mu_hat = (3 * 72) + 842 = 1058. L is set to 'default' (promised 2) because recent successful deliveries (P37 arrived in P38) show a return to shorter lead times, and mu_hat will handle the pipeline correction. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent demand swings (ranging from 5 to 163).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows 115 units on-hand and 910 units in-transit. Based on the carry-over insights, 842 of these in-transit units are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27, 30, and 32). This creates a 'phantom inventory' problem where the OR engine thinks there are 910 units coming, when only approximately 68 units (ordered in P39) are likely to arrive. To compensate for the 842 lost units being subtracted from the base stock calculation, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates this offset. The recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~75 units. For a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is ~225. Adding the 842 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1067. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and recent successful delivery observations (P37 arrived in 1 period, P33 in 3 periods, P31 in 2 periods). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to capture current volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is low (26 units). The 'In-transit' count of 1038 units is highly misleading due to 842 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, and P32). This leaves only 196 units of genuine pipeline inventory (from P39 and P41). Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (1038) from the target base stock, it will fail to order enough unless we adjust the parameters. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate current demand mean at ~85 units/period. For a target lead time of L=2 (promised), mu_hat should ideally be (1+L)*85 = 255. However, to neutralize the 842 units of phantom inventory, I add 842 to this target: 255 + 842 = 1097. For sigma_hat, I use a recent window (N=10) to capture current volatility. L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P37, P33) suggest lead times are fluctuating between 1-3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current on-hand inventory is 18 units, while the in-transit inventory is listed as 1078 units. Based on historical analysis, a significant portion of this in-transit inventory (842 units) consists of 'phantom' units from lost orders (Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 30, and 32). These units never arrived and are well beyond the recently observed lead times (which fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit inventory from the target base stock; therefore, I must set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method to offset this 842-unit drag. The recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 78 units per period. With an average lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*demand would be (3*78) = 234. Adding the 842-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1076. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to satisfy demand despite the false pipeline data. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed delivery times (approx 2 periods).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1132 units. Based on historical data, 842 of these units are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27, 30, and 32). This leaves only 290 units actually in transit (orders from P41, P42, P43). The OR engine's capped policy will prevent ordering if it believes the pipeline is full (1132 units). To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory (842 units) to ensure the engine places a corrective order. The average demand of the last 10 periods is approximately 78. With an average lead time of 2 periods (L=2), the base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 234 units) + 842 phantom units = 1076. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1076, the backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, which will exceed the 1132 in-transit units sufficiently to trigger a replenishment order and recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 842 units (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32). Actual lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system shows 2 units on-hand and 1012 units in-transit. However, historical tracking confirms that 842 of those in-transit units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27, 30, and 32). The true pipeline inventory is only 170 units (P42: 108, P43: 54, P44: 8). The OR backend is unaware of these losses and will under-order because it thinks the pipeline is full. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. The calculation is: Expected Demand for (L+1) periods + Phantom Inventory Offset. With a recent 10-period demand average of 81.3 and an estimated L of 3 (the most frequent recent lead time), the base mu_hat would be (1+3)*81.3 = 325. Adding the 842 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1167. This forces the backend to place an order that ignores the 842 dead units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are facing an on-hand stockout (0 units) while the in-transit inventory is listed at 1234 units. However, based on extensive history, 842 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' or lost (orders from P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32). This leaves a real pipeline of 392 units (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45). Recent lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 to balance this volatility. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 74 units. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover actual demand despite the 842-unit drag from phantom inventory, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. The calculation is: (1+L) * \u03bc + Phantom_Units = (1+2) * 74 + 842 = 222 + 842 = 1064. I will set mu_hat to 1064 and sigma_hat explicitly to 150 to account for high demand variance (recent peaks of 126-139) and lead-time uncertainty, ensuring a high service level for this high-profit SKU.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47, we have 36 units on hand and 1,180 units in transit. However, our Carry-over Insights indicate that 842 of these units are permanently lost (from Periods 2, 3, 13, 16, 19, 24, 27, 30, 32). This leaves a functional pipeline of 338 units (1180 - 842). The OR engine, unaware of these losses, assumes the full 1,180 units will arrive and will therefore stop ordering. To force the engine to place an order, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for both the expected demand over (L+1) periods and the 842-unit phantom inventory. The recent 5-period average demand is approximately 61 units. Using an estimated lead time of 3 (the most frequent recent lead time), the base stock should cover 4 periods (L+1). Calculation: (61 * 4) + 842 = 1,086. Setting mu_hat to 1,086 effectively 'neutralizes' the lost inventory drag. I will set L to 'explicit' 3 and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system reports 12 units on-hand and 1180 units in-transit. Based on the carry-over insights, 842 of these in-transit units are confirmed lost (from orders in P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32). This creates a 'phantom inventory' drag of 842 units, causing the OR backend to under-order. To neutralize this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With a promised L=2, (1+2)=3. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 65 units. Thus, 3 * 65 + 842 = 195 + 842 = 1037. This ensures the OR engine ignores the 842 lost units when calculating the base stock. I will use the promised lead time L=2 for the OR logic, and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $726.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 49 (the penultimate period), on-hand inventory is 42 units. Recent demand has been volatile, with a significant spike to 192 in Period 48. The current in-transit inventory is 958 units, but 842 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32), leaving only 116 units of real stock in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45 have already arrived or are accounted for; remaining in-transit must be the recent P48 order if any). Since this is the 49th period and the lead time is at least 1-3 periods, any order placed now will likely not arrive before the game ends at Period 50. Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the existing stock. However, the OR engine needs to 'see' the phantom inventory as demand to avoid under-ordering in its internal logic, though it's late for new orders. I will set L to 1 and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for both the expected demand (~95) and the 842 units of phantom inventory to neutralize the pipeline drag, ensuring that if the engine were to order, it would cover the deficit. Note: With L=1, the OR backend uses (1+1)=2 periods of demand. To offset 842 phantom units, mu_hat = (Expected Demand * 2) + 842.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P48: 192, P49: 182) shows a significant upward shift compared to the previous 5-period average (approx 90). The 'In-transit' count is 1061, but 842 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P2, P3, P13, P16, P19, P24, P27, P30, P32), meaning effective pipeline inventory is only 219 (P42, P44, P49). Lead times are volatile but currently averaging 3 periods for successful deliveries. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 842 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using (L+1) * mean_demand + 842. With L=2 (promised) and recent mean demand ~180, base stock should cover 3 periods (~540) plus the 842 offset = 1382. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to cover the recent demand spike despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 48: mean demand increased from ~85 to ~187 based on P48-P49. Phantom inventory remains 842 units.
