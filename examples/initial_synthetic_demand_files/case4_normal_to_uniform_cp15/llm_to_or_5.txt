Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 of 50. The SKU is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], the mean is 111.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.9. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which implies same-period arrival. Since there is no calendar information or product category description suggesting seasonality yet, I will use the mean of all 5 available historical samples to set the base stock level for the current period (L=0, review+lead = 1 period). This choice balances the relatively high profit margin (implying a target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) against the holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that all 127 units arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0), demand was 107, leaving 20 units on hand. Historical demand over the last 5 pre-game periods was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean=111.4). Adding the actual demand from Period 1 (107) gives us a total sample mean of ~110.7 with a standard deviation of ~14.8. Since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time (L=0), and demand remains stable compared to historical samples, I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat, and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to include the most recent demand observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $455.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we analyze the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand samples including pre-game data are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116]. The average demand over these 7 periods is approximately 111.4 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Period 1 and Period 2 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Current on-hand inventory is low at 9 units. Given the consistency of the demand and the reliable lead time, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the most recent fluctuations while maintaining stability. For mu_hat, this will target (1+L) * mean(last 5), which is (1+0) * ~114 units. This ensures we replenish enough to meet demand and maintain a buffer, while the OR backend calculates the base stock level to balance the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows values of 112, 97, 116, 138, 94 (pre-game) and 107, 116, 64 (in-game). Period 3 saw a significant drop to 64 units, bringing the mean of the last 5 samples to ~103.8 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no specific calendar date or product category information beyond 'chips', I will adjust parameters based on the recent downward trend in demand to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I'm choosing N=5 for demand and sigma estimation to capture the recent volatility and the recent dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 5 periods (including historical data provided in the prompt) shows values of 112, 97, 116, 138, 94 from the 'Past demands' and 107, 116, 64, 92 from the game history. The mean demand of the game history is approximately 94.75, while the mean of the pre-game data was 111.4. There is a slight downward trend or high variance (e.g., the drop to 64 in Period 3). I will use N=4 for the recent game history to capture the current regime more accurately. With L=0, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering the current period's demand (1+0 periods). The service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) will allow the backend to adjust to the lower recent demand levels compared to the initial 5-period snapshot.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' has consistently been 0 periods across all five concluded periods. Demand has fluctuated between 64 and 116 units, with a mean of approximately 93.4 units and a standard deviation of 19.5. The current on-hand inventory is 26 units. Since the lead time is 0, the base stock (target inventory) formula for a high-profit item (Profit/Holding ratio = 4:1) will result in a target that ensures high service levels within the current period. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage the full 5-period history, as the demand pattern appears relatively stable without a clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 6 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a slight downward trend or stabilization compared to the pre-game data [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Recent demand values in-game are [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84], averaging approximately 92 units per period. I will use a window of N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent behavior while smoothing out the dip seen in Period 3. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, leading to a target service level of 80%. Using recent_N helps the OR engine focus on these latest trends to minimize ending inventory while meeting demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history from Period 1 to 7, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history across the first 7 periods shows a mean of approximately 92 units (107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93) with some volatility, particularly the dip in Period 3. Prior data provided (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) suggests a slightly higher historical mean (~111). Combining the recent 7 periods of game demand with the 5 pre-game samples (Total N=12), the mean is approximately 100. Since Period 3's demand (64) seems like an outlier compared to the rest of the game and pre-game data, I will use a recent N of 5 for demand (averaging 88.2) to stay responsive to the slight downward trend observed during the game while maintaining enough buffer for the typical demand range (84-116). sigma_hat will be set to 'default' to capture the overall volatility including the pre-game samples, ensuring the base stock covers potential spikes.

Daily Profit: $404.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, a demand spike to 137 units resulted in an out-of-stock situation (ending inventory 0, only 101 sold). The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that all orders have consistently arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand has shown a slight increase over the last 3 periods (93, 137, plus the unspecified current period demand trend), compared to previous periods which were often in the 80-90 range. Given the stockout, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand calculations to capture the more volatile recent behavior while discarding the unusually low Period 3 demand (64). This should help the OR engine increase the base stock to prevent further lost sales during this higher-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the first 9 periods is approximately 95.5 units. In Period 8, we experienced a stockout because demand (137) exceeded our starting inventory (101), despite a lead time of 0. The demand in Period 9 returned to a lower level (78). Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical data shows that orders placed in Period N arrive and are usable within Period N (confirmed for all periods 1-9), I will keep L at its default (0). For demand estimation, I will use all 9 available samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, just natural volatility (std dev remains significant due to the Period 8 spike).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU has shown relatively stable demand with a slight increase in recent periods (Demand P8: 137, P10: 124). The inventory hit zero twice in the last 3 periods, indicating stockouts and lost sales. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by historical data (all orders arrived same-period). Total history shows 15 demand points (5 past, 10 game periods), but a slight regime shift/volatility increase is noted in the last 10 periods. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current mean and variability more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these recent spikes. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 focuses on the game performance specifically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability but no clear long-term trend or seasonal signal from the generic period markers. The mean demand over the first 11 periods is approximately 94.7 units, with the most recent sample being a low 58. However, recent periods (8-11) have seen high volatility with demands of 137, 78, 124, and 58. The 'Period X conclude' messages consistently show that the lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so 1+L=1). Given the historical volatility (from 58 to 138), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical distribution, which includes several spikes that caused stockouts in Periods 8 and 10. This approach ensures a stable service level without overreacting to the low demand in Period 11.

The recent 12 periods show a relatively stable demand mean for chips(Regular). The mean demand over these 12 periods is approximately 94.5, while the mean of the 5 historical samples provided was 111.4. There are no clear seasonal signals or date-based triggers in the provided period markers. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order from Period 1 to 12 arriving in the same period it was placed. However, stockouts occurred in Period 8 and Period 10 due to demand spikes (137 and 124 respectively), suggesting a need for slightly higher safety stock. I will use a recent_N approach (N=12) for demand mean and sigma to capture current volatility while staying responsive to those peak periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around the long-term mean. Over the last 18 samples (5 provided in history + 13 games periods), the demand has fluctuated between 58 and 138. The mean of the 13 game periods is approximately 95.5 units. There is no significant seasonal or regime shift detected yet (the dip in Period 11 was followed by a return to average levels). The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by every order from Period 1 to 13 arriving in the same period it was placed. Calculation of mu_hat using the last 13 periods (recent_N=13) provides a stable baseline for the (1+L) calculation. Sigma_hat is also set via the recent 13-period window to capture current volatility. Using these parameters, the OR backend logic will maintain a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($4) against the relatively high holding cost ($1), aiming for an ~80% service level (q = 4/(4+1)).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 14 periods, with a mean demand of approximately 97 units. In the last 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has been 124, 58, 92, 104, and 115 respectively (mean = 98.6). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, the goal is to order enough to satisfy the expected demand for Period 15. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (all available game data) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline demand pattern while allowing for the slight volatility observed (range 58-137). L will remain at the default (promised 0) as historical data confirms lead_time=0 is reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 15 periods, so L is set to 'default'. Demand has shown some volatility but appears to be trending slightly upwards in the last three periods (104, 115, 118) compared to a dip at period 11 (58). The average over the last 15 periods is 98, while the whole history (including pre-game samples) averages around 101. Given the recent cluster of higher demands, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime (avg ~97.4) while acknowledging recent volatility, ensuring the base-stock level is sufficient to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 8, 10, 14, and 15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 96 units over the last 16 periods. The most recent demand was lower (61), but notable stockouts occurred in Periods 8, 10, 14, and 15 due to demand spikes hitting inventory limits. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident in the first 16 days, I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to recent variability with the stability of the overall mean. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target a service level that covers demand fluctuations effectively. L is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand show a significant drop in Period 17 (demand=6) compared to the historical average (approx. 90-100). This appears to be a sudden outlier or a new downward shift in demand. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting its arrivals in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is high (115) and demand just plummeted, I will adjust mu_hat to be more reactive to this recent shift using N=5 for both mean and volatility, while keeping L at the default promised value of 0. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order while we wait to see if Period 17 was a one-off or a trend.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility, particularly with a very low demand of 6 in Period 17 followed by a rebound to 87 in Period 18. The average demand across the available history (Periods 1-18 plus the 5 pre-game samples) is approximately 95.8 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high variance recently (e.g., jumping from 6 to 87), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing out the extreme outlier from Period 17. The profit to holding cost ratio suggests a high service level requirement (critical ratio = 0.8), so maintaining a base stock slightly above the mean is appropriate.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the last 5 periods (demands: 118, 61, 6, 87, 43), including a sharp outlier (6 units in Period 17). The overall mean of the last 19 periods is approximately 93.4 units, while the pre-game history averaged 111.4 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by historical concludes. Given the High Profit to Holding Cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the critical fractile is 0.8, suggesting we should lean towards safety to avoid stockouts while managing the recent high variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior (including the recent volatility) while excluding the potentially higher initial pre-game estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant decrease in the mean over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), averaging 55.8 units compared to the overall historical average of 91.5 and the preceding five-period average of 96.2. In Period 17, a very low demand of 6 units was observed, followed by fluctuations between 43 and 87. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), aligning with the promised lead time. Given the recent drop in demand and high variability (std dev for last 5 periods is approx 33.5), using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 will better adapt to this lower-demand regime while allowing for sufficient safety stock to handle the high volatility. I'll maintain L at the default (0) as the shipments are reliable.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 16: average demand decreased from ~92 to ~56 (-39%) over the last 5 periods, though volatility remains relatively high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked unexpectedly to 171 units, wiping out all inventory despite a previous downward trend (averaging ~56 over P16-P20). This spike suggests the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights may be temporary or that volatility is higher than anticipated. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 0, I must order enough to cover the next period's demand. I will use a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture both the recent low-demand period and the current spike, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 75 units (Avg of 61, 6, 87, 43, 82, 171). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=6) to account for the high volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Refined Period 21: The low-demand regime (P16-P20, avg ~56) was interrupted by a significant demand spike of 171 units in P21, indicating high volatility or a potential transition to a higher demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand sharply dropped to 47 after a spike of 171 in Period 21. This confirms the high volatility noted in previous periods and suggests that the 'low-demand regime' (P16-P20, avg ~56) might still be the dominant state, albeit with significant outliers. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high variability (47 to 171 in two periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current volatile regime starting from Period 16. This provides a balanced view of the high-demand spike and the lower demand periods, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to handle potential spikes without excessive holding costs for the lower-demand baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 16; the period 21 spike (171) followed by a low 47 in Period 22 suggests a mean of ~75 with a high standard deviation, rather than a sustained shift to a higher or lower state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-55.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P16-P23) exhibits significant volatility, with values ranging from 6 to 171. The average demand across this volatile period (P16 onwards) is approximately 63.6 units, while the most recent 10-period average (P14-P23) is roughly 74 units. Given the inventory level is already at 103 units, which is high relative to these recent averages, and the volatility remains substantial (std dev > 45), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 (the exact length of the volatile regime from P16-P23) to capture this new mean without diluting it with older, more stable data. Sigma_hat also uses N=8 to account for the heightened variance seen in this period (e.g., P21: 171, P23: 12). Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the regime starting Period 16: demand extremes (6 to 171) result in a regime mean of ~64. No clear seasonal trend detected yet, just increased noise.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 has entered a high-variance regime. Recent demands include extremes such as 171 (P21), 12 (P23), and 56 (P24). The mean of the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 63 units, but the volatility is high. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies management, but we must protect against the high demand spikes to maximize profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1). I am using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-noise regime while moving away from the higher pre-P16 baseline (avg ~101). A sample of 9 is selected to balance the inclusion of both the recent low (12) and high (171) data points to ensure sigma_hat captures current volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting at Period 16) is characterized by extreme volatility rather than a simple shift in mean. Demands in this 10-period window range from 6 to 171, making a long-term average (which includes the stable ~100 mean from Periods 1-15) less responsive to the current noise. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is 62.4, but the standard deviation is significantly higher than the initial regime. In Period 25, demand was 59, which is close to the recent regime average. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's service level target (0.80) is appropriate, but we need the sigma_hat to reflect the current high volatility to avoid stockouts during the frequent spikes. Setting N=10 for all parameters captures the full breadth of the current high-volatility regime while excluding the older, more stable data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a stable mean of ~98 to a highly volatile regime. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the average demand is 68.8, but with high variance (standard deviation ~48.7) and extreme values (6 to 171). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Period 26 saw a high demand of 132, leading to a stockout. Due to the high volatility and the recent spike, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this high-variance state while providing enough safety stock to handle the frequent spikes. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Continued high volatility regime (P16-P26) confirmed. Mean demand ~69 with high standard deviation (~49); occasional spikes (e.g., P21: 171, P26: 132) frequently lead to stockouts if inventory targets are too low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand was 111, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). Since Period 16, the demand has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 6 to 171. The average demand in this volatile regime (P16-P27) is approximately 72.3 units with a high standard deviation (approx 48). The current period (P28) starts with 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high volatility and frequent stockouts (P21, P26, P27), I will set L to 'calculate' (historically 0 periods) and use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to focus exclusively on this high-volatility regime starting at Period 16. This provides the OR backend with a more accurate representation of the current regime's higher variance, which will increase the base stock level (safety stock) to better handle spikes and minimize stockout risk while maintaining the same-day arrival expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly increased volatility since Period 16, with frequent stockouts (Periods 21, 26, 27, 28) occurring because base stock levels were insufficient to meet demand spikes. The last three periods (P26-P28) show a sharp upward trend in demand: 132, 111, and 157 respectively (mean ~133). In light of this, I am identifying a new high-demand regime starting Period 26. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent spike in both mean and volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 28 conclude'. By using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will set a higher base stock to prevent further lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime detected starting Period 26: mean demand increased to ~133 (from ~69 in the previous volatile regime), causing 3 consecutive periods of stockouts/near-stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand regime starting around Period 26. In the last four periods (P26-P29), demand values were 132, 111, 157, and 133, yielding an average of 133.25. This is a significant increase from the previous volatile regime. To respond to this shift and minimize stockouts (which occurred in P26, P27, and P28), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent 4-period window (N=4). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. By adjusting to the recent average of ~133, the OR engine will target a base stock that better reflects the current appetite, while the high z-score (driven by the profit/holding cost ratio) will help buffer against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand increased to 133.25 from ~69 (+93% increase). Volatility remains significant.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted into a high-demand regime starting at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from P26 to P30 (132, 111, 157, 133, 81), the mean is 122.8 units per period. While Period 30 saw a dip to 81, the preceding four periods averaged significantly higher (~133), and the system experienced several stockouts during this transition. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation remains elevated), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P26-P30) to capture this new regime's average of 122.8. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to explicitly model the high variance observed in this specific regime. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-demand, high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. Since then, demand has averaged approximately 129.5 units (132, 111, 157, 133, 81, 163), which is a significant increase from the previous regime. The most recent demand was 163, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (Period 26 to 31) to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period's decision must account for the current 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time remains consistently 0, so I will continue using the default (promised) method to ensure the base stock calculation accurately covers the immediate demand for Period 32.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that started at Period 26. Since P26, demands have been [132, 111, 157, 133, 81, 163, 33]. While the average of this recent regime is approximately 115.7, the period-to-period swings are drastic (e.g., 163 followed by 33). The current on-hand inventory is 123. Given the Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers these potential spikes while balancing holding costs. I will continue using the recent regime (N=7, from P26 to P32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, higher-mean behavior. The 'recent_N' method for sigma_hat is preferred over 'default' to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the increased standard deviation observed in this specific regime rather than the lower volatility of the early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly erratic phase starting around Period 26. While the 'high-demand regime' identified in Period 30 saw mean demand jump to ~133, recent periods (P32 and P33) have shown extremely low demand (33 and 5 units respectively), contrasting with high demand in P31 (163). In Period 34, we start with 150 units on-hand. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true, and the service level target (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) suggests we should buffer against this high volatility, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the current regime's characteristics. I'll set N=8 (covering P26-P33) to include both the high-demand spikes and the recent sharp drops, which provides a mean demand of approximately 89.6 units and a high standard deviation. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers potential spikes while acknowledging the recent slowdown, preventing excessive overstocking since we already have 150 units available.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 5 to 163) rather than a stable high mean. Mean across P26-P33 is ~90, but standard deviation is very high (~60), requiring a higher safety stock to avoid stockouts during unpredictable spikes.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) remains characterized by extreme volatility rather than a stable mean. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has fluctuated wildly between 5 and 163, with an average of approximately 81.4 and a high standard deviation (approx 62.3). The 'Carry-over Insights' correctly identified this spike-prone behavior. Period 34 demand was very low at 18, leaving 133 units on hand. Given the zero-period lead time, we want a base stock level that covers potential spikes while acknowledging the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0). Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 captures this current volatile regime better than the long-term average. This will help the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for the frequent 130+ spikes seen in this segment (P26, P28, P29, P31) while balancing against the extreme lows (P32, P33, P34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. In Period 35, demand spiked to 144 units, completely exhausting the 144 units on hand and resulting in zero ending inventory. This follows several periods of low demand (5, 18), confirming the pattern of unpredictable, high-magnitude spikes. Since Period 26, demand has ranged from 5 to 163, with a mean of approximately 93 and a standard deviation of about 60. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's service level target (0.80) is appropriate, but the underlying parameters must account for this volatility to prevent frequent stockouts. I will use the last 10 periods (P26-P35) as the relevant regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance state. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the regime that started around Period 26. Recent demand values show a wild range: 33 (P32), 5 (P33), 18 (P34), 144 (P35), and 92 (P36). This high variance makes a simple mean forecast risky. The average demand since Period 26 (P26-P36, 11 samples) is approximately 104.5, with a high standard deviation. In Period 36, demand was 92 and we sold all units while holding 56. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (the length of the current high-volatility regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~105) and the high volatility (~55-60) which justifies carrying higher safety stock to buffer against spikes like the one seen in Period 35 (144). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that began around Period 26. Recent demand figures (P35: 144, P36: 92, P37: 32) demonstrate this instability. While the average demand over the last 12 periods (P26-P37) is approximately 91.75 units, the standard deviation is significant (~55.5). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the risk of stockouts during sudden spikes (like P35) while minimizing holding costs during troughs (like P37), I will use a 12-period window (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime. This window covers the period from the last confirmed shift (P26) to the present.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that began in Period 26. Recent demand values (P35: 144, P36: 92, P37: 32, P38: 100) maintain the volatile pattern observed previously. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue using L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a window of N=13 (covering P26 to P38) to capture the mean and variance of this current high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the frequent spikes (e.g., 144) and deep troughs (e.g., 5 or 32) characteristic of this segment, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost by maintaining sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts during demand surges.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that began around Period 26. Recent demands (P35-P39) have been 144, 92, 32, 100, and 30, resulting in a 5-period average of 79.6, while the broader regime average since P26 is approximately 84 with a high standard deviation (approx 55). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.8. To manage the extreme volatility and prevent stockouts seen in earlier periods of this regime (P26, P27, P28, P31, P35), I will use the recent_N method with N=14 (covering the entire volatile regime since Period 26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the moderate mean and the significant spikes characteristic of this period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with the most recent demand in Period 40 spiking to 139, causing a stockout. Over the last 15 periods (since the regime shift identified in Period 26), demand has averaged approximately 88.5 units, but with a range from 5 to 163 and a high standard deviation (~55). Because the lead time is consistently 0 (arriving within the same period), the safety stock must primarily account for same-period demand spikes. Given the stocking out in Period 40 and 35, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 15-period average (~89) and increasing sigma_hat using an explicit value of 60 to ensure the base-stock calculation (which uses the profit/holding cost ratio for a high service level) creates a sufficient buffer against the observed high-variance spikes. This approach aims to maximize profit by minimizing lost sales which have occurred frequently in this high-volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 continues to show extreme volatility, with demands ranging from 5 to 163. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 68, but this includes several low outliers and high spikes. The recent 5-period mean (P37-P41) is 78. Given the frequent stockouts (P35, P40) and the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should target a high service level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 16 (covering P26 to P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility inherent in this current 'noisy' regime while ensuring enough safety stock to cover demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Refined Period 34: The regime starting Period 26 is characterized by extreme noise (Range 5-163) with an average demand of ~83 over the last 16 periods. Standard deviation is high (~53), necessitating high base stock levels to mitigate frequent stockout risks despite high holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 26 continues to demonstrate extreme volatility with no clear seasonal trend. The last 17 periods (P26-P42) show an average demand of approximately 83.2 units, with a very high range (5 to 163). Because the lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period), we must target a base stock level that covers the high-end spikes of this noisy regime. With a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a safety stock that protects against most volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture this current noisy regime's mean and standard deviation for the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by severe volatility (range 5 to 163) with a mean of approximately 83. The most recent demand samples are [30, 139, 89, 76, 60], which continues to show high variance. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend targets the 80th percentile of the demand distribution to balance stockout risks against holding costs. Given the high volatility noted in Carry-over Insights (Phase starting P26), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the entire high-volatility regime from Period 26 to Period 43) to provide the OR backend with a distribution that captures these wide swings. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived=... lead_time was 0 periods' in every historical conclude message.

Daily Reward (R_t): $499.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for \u2018chips(Regular)\u2019 continues to be characterized by the high-volatility regime established around Period 26. We are currently in Period 45 of 50. In Period 44, demand was 126, which is significantly higher than the previous few periods (60, 76, 89), reinforcing the pattern of unpredictable spikes. The mean demand since Period 26 is approximately 85.5 with a high standard deviation (approx 53). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the backend OR logic will naturally target a high service level (approx 80th percentile). Because the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history, I will use lead time 'L': 'default'. To capture the current volatile regime while accounting for recent fluctuations, I'll set 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' using 'recent_N' with N=19 (covering the period from P26 to P44). This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and variance from this specific erratic regime to determine a base stock that can absorb spikes like the one seen in Period 44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be highly volatile within the regime that began at Period 26. Recent demand values (P41-P45: 89, 76, 60, 126, 72) show a mean of 84.6, which is consistent with the long-term estimate of ~83 noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 42). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding in the same period it was placed. Given the high standard deviation (approx 53) and the high service level required (q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8), I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the mean and volatility of this noisy regime (P26-P45). This balances the need for a stable estimate against the significant noise present in the data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by persistent extreme volatility, with demand ranging from 5 to 163 units. Current on-hand inventory is 113. The average demand over the last 20 periods (P27-P46) is approximately 81.3 units, with a high standard deviation. Given $4 profit and $1 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.8, necessitating a high service level to buffer against spikes like the recent P44 demand of 126. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To manage the ongoing high volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50), I will use the last 20 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current high-noise regime while smoothing out individual extreme outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we approach the final periods (48 out of 50), the primary focus is minimizing ending inventory while avoiding stockouts. The demand regime starting at Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (Range 5-163, Mean ~83, Std Dev ~53). Current on-hand inventory is 102 units. Given the 1-period remaining risk (P49 and P50 decisions left), and a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent 0-day actual lead times), I will continue using the recent regime data (N=22, covering P26-P47) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio against the need to wind down inventory. Since the simulation ends at P50, maintaining the current baseline target is sufficient to satisfy probable demand spikes in P48 and P49 without excessive over-ordering for a non-existent P51.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we experienced a massive demand spike of 192 units, which is the highest observed in the entire history (exceeding the previous high of 171 in P21). This continues the pattern of extreme volatility identified since Period 26. This spike lead to a complete stockout. We are now in Period 49, the penultimate period. To maximize reward in these final two periods, we must ensure we have enough inventory to cover potential high demand in Period 49 and Period 50. Given the recent spike, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the volatile regime (P26-P48, N=23). Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the average demand (~88) and the high volatility (std ~55), ensuring a high service level for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 48 with a demand of 192 units, confirming the high-risk, high-volatility regime starting Period 26 still persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility and high peaks, as evidenced by Period 48 (192 units) and Period 49 (182 units), both causing stockouts. The inventory was completely depleted at the end of Period 49. Because the lead time is reliably 0 periods, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential for these high-end spikes in Period 50. Over the last 24 periods (the current regime), the mean demand is approximately 84 with a standard deviation near 55. However, since the last two periods showed demand near 190, I will use an explicit forecast to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture a third possible spike while managing the holding cost risk. Setting mu_hat to 135 (the regime mean + safety buffer) and sigma_hat to 55 allows the OR backend's safety stock calculation (z* \u2248 1.28 for profit=4, holding=1) to target a base stock around 205 units, which provides coverage for the observed 180-190 spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand volatility has intensified in the final periods, with Period 48 and 49 both exceeding 180 units, representing the 95th percentile of the regime starting Period 26.
