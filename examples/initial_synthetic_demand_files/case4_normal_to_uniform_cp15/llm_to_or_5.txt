Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This gives a service level target (critical ratio) of 0.8. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand data provided: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94]. Mean demand is 111.4 and standard deviation is approximately 17.2. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, and we have zero visibility on actual lead-time behavior yet, I will use the default methods which utilize the available historical samples. L=4, mu_hat = (1+4)*111.4 = 557, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+4)*17.2 = 38.46. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and cap to generate the initial order.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 141 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly reflected as 'In-transit' and have not arrived yet. Total demand in Period 1 was 107, which resulted in lost sales as starting inventory was 0. The historical demand data (112, 97, 116, 138, 94) plus Period 1 (107) shows a stable mean around 110.6 units per period. Since there are no seasonal or calendar cues provided other than 'Period_1' and 'Period_2', I will use all available demand samples (N=6) to estimate parameters. The target base stock must cover (L+1) periods. With L=4 (promised), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Mean = ~110.6, so mu_hat should be ~553. Standard deviation of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107] is approximately 15.3, so sigma_hat for 5 periods is sqrt(5)*15.3 \u2248 34.2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order expected to arrive Period 5, visible Period 6; P2 order expected Period 6, visible Period 7). Starting on-hand is 0, across two periods with demand 107 and 116 respectively, all of which resulted in lost sales since inventory was 0. Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] plus recent demand [107, 116] shows a fairly stable mean around 111-112 units. Since we have only 5 historical + 2 recent observations, I will use all available data (N=7 effectively) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With L=4, we need to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 141+137=278. Average demand is ~111, so 5 * 111 = 555. The OR backend will see 278 in transit and order to reach the base stock target.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not arrived yet, which is expected as they are scheduled to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales because the initial stock was 0. Demand for the last 5 historical samples and 3 game periods are: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64]. The mean demand is approximately 105.5 units. The most recent demand (64) is an outlier compared to the previous average, but with only one data point, I won't treat it as a regime shift yet. I will use the default lead time (4) and use the last 5 samples (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the recent slight downward trend while maintaining enough sample size to buffer against stockouts once inventory arrives.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 563 units in-transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (from prompt) and [107, 116, 64, 92] (from game history). The combined demand mean is approximately 104 units per period. Since no orders have reached their promised delivery time yet, there is no evidence to suggest the lead time is anything other than the promised 4 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=9) to establish a stable baseline, as there is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the conclusion of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since Lead Time (L) = 4, the order cycle covers L+1 = 5 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is [107, 116, 64, 92, 88], with a mean of 93.4 and a standard deviation of 19.3. My objective is to ensure that the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods. Currently, on-hand is 53 and in-transit is 422, totaling 475. Given a mean of ~93, the expected demand over 5 periods is ~465. The system is currently well-balanced. I will use 'default' for L to stick with the confirmed lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the full available history) to capture the current demand regime accurately while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock and cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. The product is now in a steady state following the initial 4-period lead time delay where sales were lost. Confirmed lead time is 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving in P5 and P6 respectively. Current inventory is 106 on-hand with 315 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P6). Historical demand over the last 6 periods is [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84], with an average of ~91.8. There is no evidence of a demand shift yet; the fluctuation appears to be normal variance. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to reflect the full known history since there is no regime shift, and 'default' for L as the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Current inventory stands at 149 units on-hand with 252 units in-transit (orders from P4, P6, and P7). Demand history [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93] shows an average of approximately 100 units per period. Since the conclusion of P7, the demand has been relatively stable around 85-95 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable trend of ~90 units/period (88, 84, 93 plus the two pre-history samples closest to this range). Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~450-500 units) to maintain high service levels while respecting the OR backend's capping mechanism.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data from Periods 5-8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has historical values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137]. Analyzing the last few periods (P4-P8), the demand mean is approximately 98.8, while the overall mean is around 103. There is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift, although Period 8 peaked at 137. Total pipeline inventory is 146 (orders from P6, P7, and P8), and On-hand is 161. Since (1+L) = 5 periods, we need to cover approximately 500-515 units in the pipeline. 161 + 146 = 307, which is below the desired base stock. I will use 'default' for L (as it matches observed 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 to capture recent variability while smoothing the low outlier in Period 3.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The order placed in Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 9, as expected. The upcoming arrivals should be from orders placed in Period 6 (30 units expected in P10), Period 7 (73 units expected in P11), Period 8 (43 units expected in P12), and Period 9 (135 units expected in P13). Total in-transit is 281 which aligns with the sum of these orders (30+73+43+135). Demand remains relatively stable with the last 5 periods (P5-P9) having a mean of 96.0 and the last 3 periods (P7-P9) having a mean of 102.6. With L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand regime while maintaining stability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now established in the history.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 (satisfied 113 of 124 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). The order placed in Period 5 was 0, which explains the lack of arrivals in Period 9. The current in-transit pipeline is 386 units (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Demand remains relatively stable with the recent mean around 100 units (last 5 periods: 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124). Using N=10 for mu_hat captures the full history since start of operations, ensuring a robust average. Given L=4, mu_hat needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). I will stick to the default lead time (4) as it matches observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, the confirmed actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7). Demand has shown significant volatility in recent periods (ranging from 58 to 137). Period 11 saw a lower demand (58), but Period 10 was high (124). Given the current low on-hand inventory of 15 units, we must ensure the pipeline is sufficient to cover demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. The average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 95 units per period. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=11) provides a balanced estimate of roughly 104 units per period (if counting only full data), but the backend implementation logic (1+L)*mean is preferred. I will use recent_N=11 to capture the full history since the start of the game, as no clear sustained demand regime shift has occurred, just high variance. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=11 to account for the observed volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 12 (demand 92 vs available 58). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P6 order arrived P10, P7 arrived P11, P8 arrived P12). Order history analysis: orders from Period 9 (135 units), Period 10 (135 units), Period 11 (136 units), and Period 12 (56 units) are in transit, totaling 462 units. Historical demand [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] + [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92] shows a mean of approximately 98.4. L=4 requires coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Setting mu_hat to use recent_N (N=12) to capture current demand levels (average ~94) and sigma_hat to default. The pipeline of 462 units matches the expected demand over the lead time (5 * 94 = 470), so the OR backend will place a small adjustment order to reach the base stock.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU has an on-hand inventory of 31 units and 380 units in-transit. Reviewing the 'Period 13 conclude' message, the shipment from Period 9 (135 units) arrived on time with a lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time remains stable. Historical demand across the last 13 periods shows a mean of 95.15 and a standard deviation of 22.0. Recent performance shows potential for stockouts (ending inventory was 0 in Periods 10 and 12), but the pipeline is currently well-filled with orders from Periods 10-13 (135, 136, 56, 53). I will use the 'default' method for lead time (L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=13 to capture the full recent trend without including the initial seeding demand. This provides a base stock targets covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~475 units), balanced against the profit/holding cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.8), while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after some volatility. Over the last 14 periods, the average demand is approximately 104.3 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 51 units and in-transit inventory is 353 units. All deliveries since Period 5 have consistently followed the promised lead time of 4 periods, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 6. Given the stability in both lead time and demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This will set the base stock level to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of forecasted demand, balancing the risk of stockouts (which occurred in Period 10 and 12) against the holding cost of $1/unit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a mean of approximately 99.4 across the last 15 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly higher at 106.6, suggesting a minor upward trend or typical variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all concluded orders (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11). Currently, there is 69 units on hand and 344 in transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). With L=4, the base stock targets the demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand characteristics while filtering out the initial volatility of the first few periods. Since lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16). The actual lead time has matched the promised lead time without drift. Demand analysis: Demand over the last 16 periods has averaged 96.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slightly higher mean of 100.4. Using N=16 provides a stable estimate for mean and variance given the lack of clear seasonality or regime shifts in the historical data (values fluctuate around 100). The current in-transit inventory of 422 units represents orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 (53+108+127+134 = 422), which are scheduled to arrive in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 respectively. This aligns perfectly with the 4-period lead time. Parameters are set to default to utilize all historical data and the promised lead time, which have proven reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-87.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 6 units, following a period of 61 units. This represents a potential downward shift from the historical mean of approximately 95-100 units. To avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs, I am shifting to use a recent window for demand estimation. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation shows on-hand at 111 with 423 units in-transit (orders from Periods 14, 15, 16, 17). I will use N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the recent cooling of demand while maintaining enough coverage for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (1+L=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started around Period 16-17; current 2-period average is 33.5 compared to historical ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in recent periods. Historical demand averaged around 100 units, but the last three periods (P16-P18) recorded demands of 61, 6, and 87, respectively. The drop in Period 17 (6 units) was particularly drastic. While Period 18 saw a partial recovery to 87, the 3-period average of 51.3 is still substantially lower than the long-term average. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 132 units, and there are 315 units in-transit (ordered in P15, P16, P17). Given the current pipeline and the potential demand regime shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to account for the lower demand trend. Using N=3 captures the shift from Period 16 onwards. This will prevent over-ordering while the system relies on existing pipeline inventory to satisfy the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~100 to ~51 (3-period average P16-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-44.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand averaged around 100 units per period. However, starting around Period 16, the demand significantly dropped. The last four periods (P16-P19) show demands of 61, 6, 87, and 43, resulting in a new mean of 49.25 units. This shift was previously identified and is now confirmed. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (promised = actual). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (216 units) and in-transit inventory is also substantial (188 units), totaling 404 units. Given the new demand regime (approx. 50 units/period) and the total lead time + review period (1+4=5), the target inventory should be around 250 units plus safety stock. Since current inventory (on-hand + pipeline) far exceeds this, I am using recent_N (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the new regime to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: New mean demand is approx 49.25 units per period (based on P16-P19), down from historical ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent five periods (P16-P20), the demands are [61, 6, 87, 43, 82], resulting in a current mean of 55.8 units per period. This confirms the previously identified drop from the historical average of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently high (On-hand: 268, In-transit: 54), which is significantly above the required base stock for the new demand level (approximately 5 * 55.8 = 279 plus safety stock). However, because the system uses a capped order policy and the OR backend needs updated parameters to avoid over-ordering in the future, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the new, lower demand regime. This will help the system gradually reduce the surplus inventory while maintaining an appropriate service level for the lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower mean: Average demand for P16-P20 is 55.8 units (previously ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $533.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked significantly to 171 units, contradicting the previous assessment of a downward demand regime shift (which had seen averages around 55 units over the P16-P20 window). Demand history for P16-P21 is now [61, 6, 87, 43, 82, 171], averaging 75 units. This is closer to the long-term historical mean (~100) than the recent low. The on-hand inventory is 151 units, which is relatively high, and the pipeline inventory is 19 units. Given the recent volatility and the risk of overstocking if the spike was an anomaly vs. understocking if it marks a return to high demand, I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this latest demand information while respecting the promised lead time of 4. This balances the inventory against the (L+1) = 5 period outlook.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime uncertainty: P21 spike (171) broke the lower-demand trend (avg 55), bringing P16-P21 average to 75 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand returned to a lower level (47 units) after the Period 21 spike (171 units). The observed demand since Period 16 (where a regime shift was first noted) is [61, 6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47]. The mean of these 7 samples is 71.0 units, significantly lower than the initial average of ~100 but higher than the 55-unit estimate made before the P21 spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 104 and in-transit at 186 (total 290), we have approximately 4 periods of coverage at the 71-unit mean. I will use the recent 7-period demand history to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new, more volatile demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but lower than initial baseline: P16-P22 average is 71 units with high variance (standard deviation ~50.2) driven by P17 (6) and P21 (171).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a period of high volatility since Period 16, with a sequence of [61, 6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47, 12]. The average demand over these last 8 periods is approximately 63.6 units, but the oscillation is extreme, notably the spike to 171 in P21 followed by the drop to 12 in P23. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 92 and in-transit is 343 units (total 435 units). Given the high volatility but lower recent average, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the shift towards a lower, yet unstable, demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=8) to ensure the backend accounts for the increased variance (standard deviation) seen recently, which is necessary to maintain service levels during spikes like the one in P21. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-regime shift (P16-P23), ranging from 6 to 171 units per period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 16, with demand values ranging from 6 to 171. The average demand for this recent period (P16-P24) is approximately 62.7 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with historical arrivals. Currently, there is an extremely high in-transit inventory of 343 units, which is significantly higher than the aggregate demand expected over the next lead time plus one period (5 periods * ~63 units/period = 315 units). This pipeline was largely built by orders in P21 (19 units), P22 (167 units), and P23 (157 units), none of which have arrived yet. Given the high pipeline and the current on-hand inventory of 36, the system is at risk of significant overstocking if more orders are placed now. Therefore, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 9-period average to reflect the new volatile mean (approx 63 units/period), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a stable mean of ~100 to a highly volatile lower mean. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 62.1 with a high standard deviation (approx 44), largely due to extreme outliers like Period 17 (6) and Period 21 (171). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 25. There are 351 units in-transit: orders from P22 (167 units), P23 (157 units), and P25 (27 units). These are expected to arrive in Periods 26, 27, and 29 respectively. Because the backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy (L+1 periods of demand), I will set N=10 to capture the current volatile regime. This will help maintain a higher safety stock due to the high variance observed recently, while recognizing the overall lower mean compared to the initial baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 16 shift: P16-P25 mean demand is 62.1, but standard deviation has increased significantly compared to the early game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $493.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P22 order arrived in P26). However, an order from P18 (ordered 0), P19 (ordered 0), and P20 (ordered 0) means there was a gap in arrivals which recently ended. The demand regime shifted around P16. Since P16, demand has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 6 to 171. The average demand from P16 to P26 (11 periods) is approximately 68.3 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 50.1. This is a significant drop from the initial ~100 mean, but the volatility has increased. Using N=11 (P16-P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this new regime. On-hand is low (35), but in-transit is high (232), covering about 3.4 periods of demand at the current average. Maintaining a z-score for a 80% service level (Profit $4, Holding $1) requires covering about 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P26: Mean 68.3, Std Dev 50.1. Volatility is significantly higher than the pre-P16 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the demand history indicates a significant shift and increased volatility starting around Period 16. The demand in Period 27 was 111, following 132 in Period 26, which suggests the 'lower demand' period (avg ~50) may have been temporary or is transitioning into a new high-volatility phase. The average demand since the Period 16 shift (P16-P27) is 71.8. Given the high variance (ranging from 6 to 171), I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this entire post-shift volatility period while allowing the OR engine to calculate the standard deviation accurately for the base-stock level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the latest 'conclude' messages (P21 order arrived P25, P22 arrived P26, P23 arrived P27). My parameters target a service level that protects against upward volatility (the spikes of 132, 111, 171) while managing holding costs since the current on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 224.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P27: Mean 71.8, showing extreme variance (min 6, max 171). The previously observed low-mean regime (~50) has shifted towards a higher-volatility, higher-mean state in the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $324.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand spiked to 157, resulting in zero ending inventory. The demand regime starting from Period 16 has stabilized into a high-volatility, moderate-mean state (P16-P28 mean: 78.4, std: 54.0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 371 (sum of orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current period (P29) is at a stockout, I need to ensure the parameters cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (so L+1=5 periods total). Although the pipeline seems high, the extreme volatility (max demand 171) and recent stockouts require a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use the last 13 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to calculate 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current increased volatility better than the long-term history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P28 confirmed: Mean 78.4, Std Dev 54.0. The volatility is significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline, with demand ranging from 6 to 171 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime that started around Period 16. The demand from Period 16 to Period 29 has shifted from an initial low-mean state (~50) to a highly unpredictable state with a mean of 78.4 and standard deviation of 54.0. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and missed potential sales in the last two periods (Lost sales in P28 and P29). Since Period 16, the demand range is [6, 171]. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To address the current stockout and the high volatility, I will use a N=14 period window (P16 to P29) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the contemporary regime's increased variance and rising mean. The base stock calculation (\u03bc + z\u03c3) will reflect these updated statistics to better cover demand during the lead time and review period (L+1=5) and rebuild inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P29 confirmed: Mean 78.4, Std Dev 54.0. The volatility is significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline, with demand ranging from 6 to 171 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the system has 0 units on-hand and 463 units in-transit. Recent demand has been highly volatile since Period 16, with a shift in mean and variance. Specifically, demand from Period 16 to Period 30 has a mean of approximately 78.6 and a standard deviation of 52.4. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been consistently higher and volatile ([132, 111, 157, 133, 81]), averaging 122.8 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk (on-hand is 0) and the recent uptrend in volatility and volume, I will use recent_N with N=15 (covering the post-shift regime from P16-P30) to capture this higher mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the current demand environment while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P30 refined: Mean 78.6, Std Dev 52.4. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show a localized higher mean of 122.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, higher-mean state since Period 26. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is 129.5 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding Period 16-25 average (~50.5). However, demand remains extremely volatile (range 81 to 163 in this recent window). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there are 358 units in-transit, the system has experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods due to this demand surge. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime while respecting the volatility. L remains consistent at the promised 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Mean demand increased from ~50 to 129.5 (P26-P31 average), characterized by high volatility and frequent stockouts.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of shifts and is currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 26. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is approximately 115.7 units per period, but volatility is significant (ranging from 33 to 163). A localized view is necessary to capture this shift and ensure adequate base stock levels to prevent the stockouts observed between P28-P31. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to prioritize the latest regime over the earlier low-demand period (P16-P25) and the initial baseline (P1-P15). This helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for both the higher recent volume and the increased risk of variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Mean demand is approximately 115.7 (P26-P32), significantly higher than the P16-P25 average (~60). High volatility persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-209.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 26. While the mean demand from Period 26 to Period 33 is approximately 101.9, the values range from 5 to 163. Period 33 recorded a very low demand of 5, which significantly increased ending inventory since a large shipment of 120 arrived. Currently, we have 229 units on-hand and 431 in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high volatility (standard deviation remains high) and the recent spike in inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 26-33) to capture this new regime's characteristics while the OR backend balances the service level against the current high holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26-P33 confirmed: Mean 101.9, with high volatility (range 5-163). This regime follows a lower-demand period (P16-P25) and is characterized by unpredictable spikes and drops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-186.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 26, following a period of relatively low demand. In the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand has fluctuated wildly between 5 and 163 units, with a mean of approximately 93 units. The most recent three periods (P32-P34) have shown significantly lower demand (33, 5, 18), but given the historical spikes (e.g., 163 at P31, 157 at P28), it is risky to assume demand will stay low. Currently, on-hand inventory is 258 units and in-transit inventory is 384 units (from orders in periods 31, 32, and 33), totaling 642 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and a review period of 1, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-volatility regime (P26-P34). The OR backend will see that combined inventory (642) likely exceeds the required base stock for this regime, and will adjust orders accordingly to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: P26-P34 demand regime: mean ~93.2, extreme volatility persists (range 5-163).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 26, with the most recent demand at 144 units. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 35 (N=10), the mean is approximately 97.7 units per period with a very high standard deviation. The 'In-transit' inventory is 340 units, which includes the large orders placed in Periods 32 and 33 (180 and 160 units respectively) that are expected to arrive in the next few periods (P36 and P37). With 158 units on-hand and 340 in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current lead time (L=4). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-volatility regime that started at P26, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: P26-P35 demand regime: mean ~97.7, persists with extreme volatility (range 5-163).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 26. In the current regime (P26-P36), demand has fluctuated between 5 and 163 units. The mean for this 11-period window is 97.2 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 55.4. Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 246 units, and there are 263 units in-transit (orders from P33 and P36). Specifically, the 160 units ordered in P33 are expected to arrive in P37 (visible in P38 conclude), and the 103 units ordered in P36 are expected in P40. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and recent trend, I will use a 11-period window (P26-P36) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-variance regime. Setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend accounts for the observed mean of ~97.2 and the high standard deviation, providing a buffer against the frequent demand spikes while managing the holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26-P36 confirmed: Mean ~97.2, with continued extreme volatility (Std Dev ~55.4, range 5-163).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 97.2 units and a standard deviation of 55.4 based on the latest 12-period window (P26-P37). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (374 units) following the arrival of a large shipment (160 units) and low recent demand (32 units). In-transit inventory stands at 187 units (orders from P36 and P37). The OR backend's base-stock calculation must account for the high variance to ensure service levels during potential spikes, while managing the risk of excessive holding costs given the currently high stock levels. I will use a recent_N window of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime accurately.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with no clear seasonal trend (Current Period 39). Following the regime shift identified at Period 26, the demand mean (P26-P38) is approximately 93.3 units per period with a high standard deviation (approx 55.0). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by numerous historical arrivals (e.g., P33 order arrived P37, P32 order arrived P36). My strategy is to set the demand estimation (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the recent regime (last 13 periods, P26-P38) to capture the higher variance while ensuring sufficient stock for the lead time + review period (L+1). I have 274 units on-hand and 193 in pipeline (467 total); using recent_N=13 for mu_hat will help the OR backend calculate a target base stock commensurate with the current volatile but elevated demand level. The high standard deviation will increase the safety stock (via sigma_hat), which is necessary given the frequent spikes observed up to 163 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-124.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) shows significant volatility with a mean of approximately 92.5 units over the last 14 periods (P26-P39) and a standard deviation around 56. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P35-P39) have averaged 79.2 units, but individual spikes or drops are common. The current inventory position is strong with 244 on-hand and 291 in-transit (total 535 pipeline). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using the regime mean of ~92.5, 5 periods of demand equals ~463 units. Given we have 535 in the pipeline, we are well-covered. However, the high standard deviation warrants maintaining a consistent safety stock. I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture the high-volatility regime since Period 26 for both mean and sigma calculation.

Carry-over insight: P26-P39 demand regime confirmed: Mean ~92.5, Std Dev ~56.0. High volatility persists with a wide range (5-163).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility and a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units (P26-P40). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 208, and in-transit inventory is 197 units. With lead time L=4, my parameters (L+1) must cover the next 5 periods of demand. Using N=15 (the duration of the current regime from P26 to P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the heightened volatility and the new mean level. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes (like P31 or P40) against the holding costs of the current elevated inventory levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that started around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 41, the mean demand is approximately 92.4 units per period with a high standard deviation (approx 54.2). The current inventory state shows 203 units on-hand and 268 in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). Since the promised lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by recent arrivals from P36 and P37), I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the statistics of the current regime that began at Period 26. This allows the OR backend to account for the sustained higher mean and significant variance observed in this specific phase of the game, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that started around Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 42, the average demand is approximately 89.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 51.5. In the most recent 10 periods (P33-P42), the average is 74.2, but this lower average is skewed by a few very low-demand periods (e.g., P33 and P39). Given the extreme volatility (range 5 to 163) and the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a conservative approach that covers potential spikes is necessary. The Lead Time is confirmed as 4 periods. My parameters aim to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) using the mean and standard deviation from the established high-volatility regime (N=17 periods, from P26 to P42). I'll use recent_N with N=17 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this entire regime while smoothing out the most recent localized fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26-P42: Mean 89.2, Std Dev 51.5. The volatility remains the defining characteristic of this regime compared to earlier phases.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 5-163, Mean ~89), necessitating a high service level to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on observed arrivals (e.g., Period 39 order arrived in Period 43). With 171 units on-hand and 318 in-transit (total 489), and approximately 7 periods remaining in the game (L=4 + some buffer), current coverage is around 70 units per period. Given the high volatility and potential for spikes, I will use recent_N (N=18, covering Period 26 to present) to capture the current high-volatility regime mean and standard deviation for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L at 'default' (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, a characteristic of the regime established around Period 26. The most recent demand (Period 44) was 126 units, which is above the long-term average for this regime (~90) but well within the observed range (5-163). The average demand from Period 26 to Period 44 is approximately 90.9 units with a standard deviation of 51.5. Given we are at Period 45 of 50, and the promised lead time is 4 periods (making the next arrival visible in Period 49/50), we are entering the final replenishment cycles. The current on-hand inventory is 54, and in-transit units total 358. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (matching the length of the current regime starting at P26) to capture the high volatility while centering the mean on the current regime's behavior. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average demand and the significant variance to minimize stockouts in the remaining periods.

chips(Regular): ordered=135, arrived=155 units (ordered on Period 41, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=209, demand=72, sold=72, ending on-hand inventory=137

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is characterized by extremely high volatility (range 5-180+) with a mean that has fluctuated around 90-100 units. The most recent demand (P45) was 72. Given the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) will arrive during Period 50\u2014the final period of the game. Our objective is to have enough inventory to cover the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) while minimizing leftover inventory at the end of P50. Current on-hand is 137. In-transit inventory consists of orders from P42 (85), P43 (69), P44 (49), and P45 (135), totaling 338. These will arrive in P46, P47, P48, and P49 respectively. Total potential inventory available to satisfy demand for the rest of the game is 137 + 338 = 475. Over the remaining 5 periods, if we assume the regime mean of ~90, total demand will be ~450. Thus, we are already positioned with enough inventory to meet expected demand with a small buffer. I will use the recent_N method (N=20, covering the volatile regime from P26 onwards) to capture the current mean and high variance, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the final stretch without over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-132.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, a regime that has persisted since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent period (P46), demand was low (18 units), following a moderate demand in P45 (72 units). The mean demand from Period 26 to Period 46 is approximately 87.2 units, which is consistent with the 'Period 43' carry-over insight of ~89.2. Given we are at Period 47 out of 50, the primary concern is managing ending inventory for the final periods while avoiding stockouts during the lead time. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 204 units, with 318 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use a N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (starting roughly P31) while giving more weight to the recent average which has slightly trended downwards compared to the immediate post-P26 spike. This targets a service level that protects against spikes (like the 126 in P44) without over-ordering as the game approaches its end.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26-P46 maintained: Mean ~87.2, high volatility persists. Game approaching end (P47/50), inventory management focus shifts to minimizing leftover stock while covering remaining demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-153.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game ends after Period 50 arrivals and demand are resolved. Orders placed now (Period 48) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, any order placed now is a waste of capital and will incur holding costs without the possibility of being sold. Current status shows 249 units on-hand and 249 units in-transit. The in-transit units are from Period 44 (49 units), Period 45 (135 units), and Period 46 (65 units). These will arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. Total available units for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) is 249 (on-hand) + 249 (in-transit) = 498 units. Given the recent demand mean of approximately 87 units per period, 498 units is more than enough to cover the expected demand of ~261 units (3 * 87) for the remainder of the game. I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are placed.

Daily Profit: $768.00, Daily Holding Cost: $106.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $662.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 49/50). Current on-hand inventory is 106 units, and there are 200 units in-transit. Specifically, the order from Period 45 (135 units) is expected to arrive during Period 49, and the order from Period 46 (65 units) is expected to arrive during Period 50, based on the confirmed 4-period lead time. Summing current on-hand (106) and confirmed in-transit arrivals (200), we have 306 units available to cover the demand for Period 49 and Period 50. Since the mean demand in the current high-volatility regime (since Period 26) is approximately 87-90 units per period, 306 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand (~180 units total) for the remaining two periods. Excess inventory at the end of Period 50 incurs holding costs without further profit opportunities. Therefore, I am setting all parameters to effectively zero out further ordering while maintaining the logic of the current demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $669.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. Orders placed now will never arrive within the game's timeframe (promised lead time is 4, and arrival resolution happens after the decision). Therefore, the objective is to order 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs and ending inventory charges, as any units ordered now will only count against the pipeline inventory without providing utility. Current on-hand inventory (59) and the final in-transit arrival (65 units ordered in P46) will be processed during the Period 50 arrival/demand resolution phase, after which the game ends.
