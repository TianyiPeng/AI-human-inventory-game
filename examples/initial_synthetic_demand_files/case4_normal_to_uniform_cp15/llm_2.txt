Since the promised lead time is 0, the order I place now should arrive during the arrival resolution phase of this same period to satisfy this period's demand. To account for the possibility of variance and the fact that I start with 0 on-hand inventory, I will target the higher end of the sample range (around 140) to ensure a high service level, while being mindful that holding costs are $1.0 per unit. Since I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately, an order of 140 units is a reasonable starting point to build a small buffer while meeting expected demand.",

Demand history reveals a volatile pattern without clear seasonality (Period_17 provides no calendar indicators). Initial samples suggested ~111, followed by a 'lower regime' (~90), then a volatile 'high regime' (~113). Most recently (P12-P16), demand has averaged 98 units, but with significant swings (61 to 118). In P15, we stocked out with demand at 118, and in P16 demand dropped to 61. With 74 units currently on hand and a lead time of 0, I need to order enough to cover Period 17 demand while accounting for a potential high-side swing (around 120-130 units). Target inventory for the end of the period (after arrival but before demand) should be roughly 130 to ensure a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio. 130 - 74 (on hand) = 56 units. I will order 56 units to reach that target.",

Ordering additional units now would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit) without improving service level, as 124 units is likely sufficient to cover P18 demand unless a massive, outlier spike occurs.

Given the recent collapse in demand to single digits, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for a potential return to the higher mean (~100-130 units). Since the SKU is 'regular' chips and there is no specific calendar indicator for this period, I will rely on the observed inventory. With 130 units on hand and 0 lead time, I have enough stock to cover even a high-demand spike (historical max ~171) if it returns next period, without ordering more.
