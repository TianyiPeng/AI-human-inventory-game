Lead time has been highly variable: P1(1), P5(2), P6(3), P7(3), P9(3), P11(3), P12(1). While P12 arrived in 1 period, the majority of recent shipments take 3 periods.

Historical demand analysis shows high volatility with occasional outliers (e.g., P17=6, P23=12, P33=5), but recent periods (P40-P42) average ~101 units. I will use a forecast of ~100 units per period. Regarding lead time and supply chain: the 'In-transit' figure of 1576 is deceptive. My tracking shows 1526 units are confirmed lost (Orders P2, P3, P8, P13, P16, P19, P24, P30, P32). The actual effective pipeline is only 400 units: P40 (100), P41 (50), and P42 (250). In P42, the P39 order (75 units) arrived after a lead time of 3. For the current Period 43 decision, on-hand is low (17). Expected arrivals over the next 3 periods (L=2) are the orders from P40, P41, and P42. Total inventory + effective pipeline = 17 + 400 = 417. Covering 4 periods of demand (P43-P46) at 100/period requires ~400 units.

Total confirmed lost units in history remain at 1526. To protect against the high loss rate and maintain service levels for the remaining 6 periods, an order of 150 units is placed to buffer against the potential loss of the P41 and P42 shipments while covering the current demand regime (~100 units).",

Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1726 units, but historical analysis confirms 1526 of these are lost (Orders P2, P3, P8, P13, P16, P19, P24, P30, P32). This leaves an effective pipeline of 200 units (P42: 250, P43: 150, P44: 150). Given the lead time of 3 periods, I need to cover demand for Periods 45, 46, and 47. Expected demand for 3 periods at 85 units/period is 255 units. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 550 units (P42-P44), I technically have coverage if the shipments arrive.

The pipeline is heavily compromised: out of 1876 units 'In-transit', approximately 1526 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P3, P8, P13, P16, P19, P24, P30, and P32). The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P42 (250 units), P43 (150 units), P44 (150 units), and P45 (150 units). Based on the confirmed 3-period lead time for recent successful deliveries (P39, P40, P41 all took 3 periods), the P42 order of 250 units is expected to arrive during P45 (concluded) or P46. Since it did not appear in the P45 conclude message, it is expected to arrive during P46 and be visible at the start of P47.

Period 46 saw a low demand of 18 units, following 72 in P45 and 126 in P44. Lead Time & Reliability: Successful shipments (P39, P40, P41, P43) consistently arrive with a 3-period lead time. However, the loss rate remains extremely high (confirmed lost units: 1526). Current Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 132. The 'In-transit' figure of 1926 is misleading; subtracting the 1526 confirmed lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 400 units (Orders from P42, P44, P45, P46). Order from P42 (250 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, further reducing the effective pipeline to 150 units (P44, P45, P46). Strategy: With only 4 periods remaining (47, 48, 49, 50), and a 3-period lead time, orders placed in P47 will arrive in P50 (the final period). Orders placed after P47 will not arrive. On-hand (132) + effective pipeline (150) = 282 units. Expected total demand for P47-P50 is ~320 units (4 periods * 80 avg). Therefore, a small final order is needed to cover the potential shortfall in Period 50, while being cautious not to over-order given the high holding cost and the risk of the P42 order being simply delayed rather than lost.",

Our on-hand inventory is 108 units, which covers nearly two periods of average demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1976 is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders; based on recent history (P39, P40, P41, P43 all having lead times of 3 periods), the effective pipeline consists of P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), P46 (200 units), and P47 (50 units). P44 is due now (P48) and P45 is due in P48 or P49. However, the loss rate remains high (~50-60%). Given we only have 3 periods left (48, 49, 50), the goal is to maximize sales without incurring excessive holding costs on inventory that won't sell before the game ends. An order placed now (P48) would likely arrive in P51 (after the game), assuming a 3-period lead time. Even with a 2-period lead time, it arrives in P50. Since on-hand (108) plus likely arrivals from P44-P46 provides a substantial buffer relative to the remaining lifespan of the game, I will place a minimal order to hedge against further shipment losses while avoiding end-of-game waste.",

The most recent demand (Period 48) was a high spike of 192 units, but the 10-period average is approximately 80-85 units. Even if demand remains at the high level of ~190 units, the 316 units currently on-hand are more than sufficient to cover the final period (Period 50) demand. Furthermore, we must account for the units already in-transit from Period 44 (150 units), Period 48 (50 units), and potentially Period 42 (though likely lost). Even without additional arrivals, the risk of a stockout in the single remaining period is negligible compared to the certainty of incurring holding costs on excess inventory.
