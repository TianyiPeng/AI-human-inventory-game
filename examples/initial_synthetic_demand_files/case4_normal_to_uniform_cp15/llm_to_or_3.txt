Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0, with no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My objective is to establish an initial order that covers the inventory needs for the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), implying a relatively high service level. Initial past demand data shows a mean of 111.4 units ([112, 97, 116, 138, 94]). I will use 'default' methods for the OR backend, which will calculate (1+L) * mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L) * std for sigma_hat based on these 5 samples. This sets a baseline for the first period's order.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and faced a demand of 107 units. However, because inventory arrivals happen after the decision phase and on-hand started at 0, 107 units of demand were lost (sold=0). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], with Period 1 adding 107. The mean demand is approximately 110.7. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead-time deviation beyond the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game periods was [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111.4). In Period 1 and 2, demand was 107 and 116 respectively, which aligns with this baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (137 units) are in-transit (total 278). The first arrival is expected in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Since there are no concluded arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and the mean of the available demand samples (N=7 total, including pre-game) to set parameters. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand while waiting for the pipeline to start arriving.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows values of [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64] (in-game). The mean demand across all 8 samples is approximately 105.5 units. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in periods 1, 2, and 3 (141, 137, and 136 units respectively) are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive starting in Period 5 (L=4 means order at P1 arrives in P1+4=P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 414 units are in-transit. Since we have not reached the promised lead time for any orders yet, there is no evidence that the actual lead time differs from the promised lead time, nor that shipments are lost. I am using the 'default' method for L, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the full trajectory, though the last demand point (64) was slightly lower than previous cycles.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 104 units (112, 97, 116, 138, 94 from pre-game; 107, 116, 64, 92 from Periods 1-4). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the game started at Period 1, an order placed at the start of Period 1 with L=4 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5. Therefore, we should see the first arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have had time to arrive, resulting in lost sales. The pipeline (In-transit) is 555 units, which matches the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (141+137+136+141). There is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. I will use the default lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=9, including pre-game and active periods) to capture the current mean while smoothing out the dip seen in Period 3.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with samples: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (pre-game) and [107, 116, 64, 92, 88] (ingame). The mean of all 10 samples is approximately 103.4. Currently, we have 53 units on-hand and 418 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover demand for Period 6 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods is ~517 units. Total inventory (on-hand 53 + in-transit 418) is 471, which is slightly below the required 517. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data to set the base stock, as there is no evidence of a regime shift or lead-time deviation yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived end of P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but stays within a predictable range. The initial 5 historical samples given were [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111.4). The actual demands observed since the game started (P1-P6) are [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84] (mean ~91.8). There is a slight downward shift in demand mean since the simulation started compared to the pre-game history. I will use a window of the last 6 samples (actual game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this more recent, lower demand mean while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 106 + In-transit: 360 = 466) is robust relative to demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 149 units and 252 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Demand history shows [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] before execution and [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93] during execution. The demand appears relatively stable, though it has slightly softened from the initial pre-game samples (mean ~92 in the last 7 periods vs ~111 initially). Since the lead time L=4 is stable and confirmed, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most recent realized demand regime since the start of the simulation, which reflects a slightly lower average demand than the combined history. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 1+L = 5 periods) is grounded in recent performance to minimize holding costs while the backend handles the service level logic.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory includes 153 units on-hand and 202 units in-transit. Data from periods 5-8 confirms a lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand shows a mean of approximately 104 across 13 samples (including pre-game), with a recent slight increase peaking at 137 in Period 8. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full observed history from Period 1-8) to capture the base demand trend while dampening the volatility from the most recent spike. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that balances the high service level (due to $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) against the risk of overstocking as shipments continue to arrive regularly.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-9) confirms actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable. Historical demands are [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (initial) and [107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78] (game history). The mean demand across all observed samples (14 total) is approximately 101.4. Current on-hand is 79 with 333 units in-transit. The OR engine needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the game history demand pattern since lead time resolution began, effectively stabilizing the inventory levels against the observed mean of roughly 100 per period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical demand for chips(Regular) over the last 10 periods has a mean of approximately 98.3 and a standard deviation of 22.0. Looking at the history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5-10). Currently, we have 34 units on-hand and 361 units in-transit (orders from periods 7, 8, 9, and 10). The OR backend parameters should ensure the pipelined inventory covers the (L+1) period demand horizon. Since L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the 'default' method for L (which is 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (encompassing all observed periods to stabilize against recent demand volatility like the jump to 124 in P10) will allow the OR engine to set a base stock level that targets an 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability with some fluctuation, averaging approximately 102 units over the last 11 periods. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (4 units) following the Period 11 conclusion, but a large pipeline inventory (469 units) is in place, consisting of orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11. Specifically, the order of 91 units from Period 8 is expected to arrive during Period 12. To ensure the base stock levels are calculated correctly, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=11 to capture the full confirmed regime since the start, while keeping lead time (L) at 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all completed arrivals (Periods 5-12). Historical demand from Period 1 to 12 shows a mean of approximately 94.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 22.3. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 78, 124, 58, 92, and the seed data) oscillates but remains within a stable range. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but there are 425 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12), which matches the pipeline expected for a 4-period lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full operative history while allowing for recent variability. The OR backend will compute the base stock for L+1 (5 periods) and subtract the units in transit to determine the next order.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 14. Based on historical data from periods 5 through 13, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 13 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 95.3 and a standard deviation of 21.6. There are no clear seasonal spikes or regime shifts detected; however, there were stockouts in the first 4 periods due to lead-time delay. The current on-hand inventory is 34 units and pipeline inventory is 379 units. Total system inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 413 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of average demand (413 / 95.3). Since target base stock should cover L+1 = 5 periods, and we are slightly below that coverage, the OR engine needs accurate parameters to maintain service levels. Using the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'calculate' for lead time averages is appropriate. For demand, using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 (covering all post-start-up periods) provides a stable estimate of mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 26 units, which is low compared to the average demand. However, the in-transit pipeline is 378 units, and historically, orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5 through 14). Specifically, the order from Period 11 (136 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 15. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but oscillates around a mean of approximately 98 units per period (calculated from the last 14 periods: 107, 116, 64, 92, 88, 84, 93, 137, 78, 124, 58, 92, 104, 115). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the full recent history after the initial 5 samples, ensuring the OR engine accounts for this average demand and its variance. The lead time (L) remains at the promised/confirmed level of 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed consistent demand with an average of approximately 101.5 units over the last 15 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by all recorded arrivals (Periods 5-15). Demand has been relatively stable with some variance (standard deviation around 20-25). Current on-hand inventory is 44 units, and in-transit inventory is 363 units (covering orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15). To maintain a good service level while managing holding costs, I will use recent trends to set parameters. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 10 samples to capture the most relevant demand levels, and I'll use the default lead time (4 periods). This covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 10 samples to reflect current volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by all arrivals from P1 to P12). On-hand inventory is 30 units, with 456 units in-transit (orders from periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). The average demand over the last 16 periods is approximately 100.1 units. The most recent demand (P16) was lower at 61, but the overall mean has been stable around 100 with moderate variance. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the full established demand pattern while allowing the OR engine to calculate statistical safety stock. Lead time (L) remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant drop in the most recent period (P17 demand was 6), compared to the previous average. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the mean demand is approximately 81, which is lower than the long-term average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 113, and there is a large pipeline of 404 units. To avoid overstocking while adjusting to this recent volatility and potential demand shift, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility calculation. This provides a more responsive forecast to the recent drop while still maintaining enough safety stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable decline over the last few periods (Periods 16-18: 61, 6, 87), contrasting with the earlier average of approximately 100. Calculating the mean of the last 5 samples (118, 61, 6, 87, and the current observation for Period 18 which is 87) provides a more responsive forecast to this recent drop while still accounting for variability. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (matches promised). With on-hand inventory at 132 and significant in-transit stock (298 units), we are well-covered for the next few periods. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and standard deviation to adjust to this lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, which would accrue high holding costs ($1/unit) given the shelf-stable nature of the product. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering (4+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: demand decreased from a historical average ~105 to ~75 across the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The demand values for the last four periods are 61, 6, 87, and 43, averaging approximately 49.25, which is a sharp decline from the previous historical average of ~105. This shift is likely sustained, as noted in the Period 19 Carry-over Insight. In-transit inventory is currently 221 units, and on-hand inventory is 210 units. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (making the look-ahead window L+1 = 5 periods), the total demand across that window at the new average would be ~250 units. With current pipeline + on-hand inventory totaling 431 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand levels. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method as the observed lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and extended: Period 16-19 average demand is 49.3 units, down from ~105 (over 50% decrease).

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically averaging ~105 units/period, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 55.8 units (61, 6, 87, 43, 82). While the last period saw a bounce-back to 82, the lower mean is established. On-hand inventory is currently high (268 units) relative to this new demand level, and there are 81 units in-transit (orders from P17 and P19). The lead time remains constant at 4 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new demand mean (~56 units/period) and allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock (1+L) * mu_hat accurately, which will likely result in no order being placed this period due to the high on-hand surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $550.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the chips(Regular) SKU is navigating a highly volatile demand regime. A significant shift occurred around Period 16; however, Period 21 saw a massive sudden spike to 171 units, contradicting the previous low-demand trend (avg ~49). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 134 units, with 44 units in-transit (expected from the Period 19 order). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent extreme fluctuation (a drop followed by a sharp spike), a wide window (recent_N=6) for mu_hat is chosen to capture the volatility of Periods 16-21 (average demand ~75) while adjusting for the high variance. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for this increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without over-ordering against a possibly anomalous spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly after Period 16; demand saw a trough (avg ~49, P16-P20) followed by a sharp spike (171, P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility and potential regime instability. From Period 1 to 15, demand averaged ~104. Since Period 16, demand has fluctuated wildly: [61, 6, 87, 43, 82, 171, 47]. The Period 21 spike (171) was a clear outlier compared to the Period 17-19 trough (avg ~45). Currently, we see a mean demand of approximately 71 over the last 7 periods (P16-P22). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 = 5 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding the Period 18 order of 0 and the Period 22 arrival resolution which resulted in 0 because no order was placed in Period 18). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the post-regime-shift behavior, which should translate to roughly 355 units (5 * 71) for the review+lead period. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the heightened volatility observed recently, allowing the OR backend to maintain a sufficient safety stock without over-ordering during low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after Period 16: demand range [6, 171]. Period 16-22 average demand is approximately 71 units, down from the initial 15-period average of ~104.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility. Following the regime shift at Period 16, demand has fluctuated wildly between 6 and 171 units. The average demand for the post-shift period (P16-P23) is approximately 63.6 units, but the high standard deviation (~51.5) necessitates a conservative approach to avoid stockouts during spikes like the one seen in P21 (171). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 119, with 322 units in-transit. A notable gap exists because the order from Period 18 (0 units) was documented, and the order from Period 22 (167 units) is still in transit. Given the ratio of profit ($4.0) to holding cost ($1.0), the service level (q) is 0.8. I will use the last 8 samples (P16-P23) to capture the current high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent average and the significant variance.

Carry-over insight: Post-Period 16 demand regime update: Average demand for P16-P23 is ~64 units with a high standard deviation (~51), confirming a shift to high-volatility, lower-mean demand compared to the first 15 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the demand context remains highly volatile. Since Period 16, demand has fluctuated between 6 and 171, with the most recent sample at 56 and the Period 16-24 average approximately 63 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P19 arrived at P23 conclusion). We are currently in a high-variance, lower-mean regime compared to the first 15 periods. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering Period 16 to 24) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this increased volatility and the drop in average demand. The OR backend will use these values to buffer against the high variance (sigma_hat) while reflecting the lower average demand (mu_hat), balancing the 80% target service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) against the risk of overstocking during low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated: P16-P24 range [6, 171] with mean ~63. No new shifts detected in lead time or regime transitions since Period 24.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted after Period 16, transitioning from a stable mean of ~104 to a high-volatility, lower-mean state. For Periods 16-25 (last 10 samples), the mean demand is ~62.6 with high variance (range 6 to 171). The order placed in Period 18 was never concluded (skipped in the arrival sequence between P17 and P19 arrivals), effectively signaling a lost shipment. The pipeline inventory (343 units) is comprised of orders from P22, P23, and P25. Given the promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent in recent actual arrivals (P19 reached in P23), I will set L to 4. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the post-shift mean of ~63, which, at L=4, results in a base stock target covering 5 periods of demand (~315 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to account for the significantly increased volatility in this regime, helping the OR engine set a safer inventory buffer against the spikes seen recently (e.g., 171 units).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Order from Period 18 never arrived; subsequent orders (P19) have already arrived.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 concluded with an arrival of 167 units from Period 22, confirming the actual lead time remains 4 periods. The lost shipment from Period 18 is now a distant event, but it highlights the need for robust base stock. Since Period 16, demand has been highly volatile, characterized by sharp drops (e.g., 12 in P23) and significant spikes (e.g., 171 in P21, 132 in P26). The mean demand for this 'high-volatility' regime (P16-P26) is approximately 71 units, compared to the initial 15-period average of ~104. Currently, on-hand inventory is 39 and in-transit is 228. To capture the recent shift while accounting for the high variance, I will use a recent_N approach with N=11 (the length of the current regime starting Period 16). This allows the OR backend to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this specific volatility profile. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target cycle service level is 80%, which the OR engine will use to manage the trade-off. Choosing L=4 (promised/actual) and N=11 for demand stats ensures the policy is reactive to the lower mean but high variance of the recent 11 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we observe that demand remains in a high-volatility regime that started at Period 16. The demand from P16 to P27 shows a mean of approximately 81.3 units, but with a wide range (6 to 171). The recent two periods (P26: 132, P27: 111) suggest demand might be trending higher again compared to the P16-P20 trough, but it is still highly unpredictable. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22 arrived at end of P26, P23 arrived at end of P27). However, we must account for the lost shipment from Period 18, which is permanently missing from the lead-time pipeline. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of this high-volatility demand. I will use a recent window of N=12 (P16-P27) to capture this current regime's mean and standard deviation, which will provide a more responsive base stock than the global average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-27 confirmed as high volatility (range 6-171) with a regime mean of ~81 units, significantly different from the initial 15-period mean of ~104.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a stable mean of ~104 to a highly volatile regime. From P16 to P28, the mean demand is 73.1, but volatility is extremely high (range 6 to 171). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P28 caused by a spike in demand (157). The in-transit pipeline (369 units) includes orders from P25 (21 units), P26 (52 units), P27 (149 units), and P28 (147 units). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the P25 order is expected to arrive during P29 (observed in P30), ending the current stockout. To address the increased volatility and recent stockout while accounting for the lower average demand in this second regime, I will use recent_N (N=13, from P16-P28) for demand parameters. This ensures mu_hat reflects the current lower average while sigma_hat captures the significant volatility required to maintain service levels during spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. In the last three periods (P27-P29), demand has been high (111, 157, 133), resulting in stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P28 and P29) despite arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant pipeline of 470 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the recent demand surge and high volatility (standard deviation), I will use the last 14 periods (P16-P29) to capture the current high-volatility regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for both the lower average seen earlier in this regime and the recent sharp spikes, balancing stockout risk against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from Period 27-29 shows a return to higher demand levels (avg ~134) within the high-volatility regime (P16-P29), leading to two consecutive periods of stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout due to a recent demand surge. Demand over the last 4 periods (P27-P30) has averaged 120.5 units (111, 157, 133, 81), which is significantly higher than the average since the P16 regime shift. The most recent demand (P30) was 81, suggesting a stabilization at a higher level than the previous trough. However, the high volatility (sigma) remains a concern. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand cluster while maintaining a high safety stock via the default sigma calculation, which factors in the wide variance seen since P21. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, but the lost shipment from P18 and the delayed arrival of the P24 order (which was 0 units) have tightened the pipeline. I need to maintain high parameters to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level (avg ~120) across P27-P30 compared to the P16-P25 period, while volatility remains consistently high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P31) shows a significant increase, with samples: 111, 157, 133, 81, 163. This averages approximately 129 units, which is a marked departure from the previous low-demand regime (P16-P25). Stockouts have occurred in 4 of the last 5 periods (P28, P29, P30, P31), indicating that the OR backend's current parameters are insufficiently covering this surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P27 arrived at P31). To address the stockouts and higher demand levels, I will shift the lookback window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new 'high demand, high volatility' regime. This will increase the base stock calculation to better match current consumption rates and protect against the high variability observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 27: mean demand increased to ~129 (P27-P31) from the previous high-volatility mean of ~81 (P16-P27), resulting in frequent stockouts.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 27, moving from a low-mean, high-variance regime (~81/period) to a higher-mean regime. From P27 to P32, demand values were [111, 157, 133, 81, 163, 33], averaging 113. Period 32 showed a sharp drop (33), but given previous stockouts (P28-P31), we must maintain a higher base stock to avoid further lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime starting at P27, while accounting for the high volatility observed in the data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 confirmed with higher mean (~113) compared to the P16-P26 period (~81), though volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 46.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-211.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 27, moving to a higher mean (~113) with significant volatility (range 5-163). In Period 33, demand was extremely low (5 units), causing ending inventory to spike to 231. The order from Period 18 is confirmed lost (skipped by P19 delivery). Current in-transit (423 units) plus on-hand (231 units) equals 654 units, which covers over 5.5 periods of the current average demand (~113). Since the lead time is 4 periods and we aim for a coverage of L+1 (5 periods), we are currently overstocked due to the recent low demand. To prevent further unnecessary building of inventory while maintaining a high service level for the volatile demand, I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand and sigma estimation to capture this high-volatility regime (P27-P33). The OR backend's capped policy will help naturally throttle ordering until the inventory is digested.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 refined: 7-period average (P27-P33) is ~98 units with extremely high volatility (StdDev ~61, range [5, 163]), resulting in alternating stockouts and overstocks.

The demand regime since Period 27 has been characterized by extreme volatility (range 5-163) and a slightly lower mean compared to the initial 15 periods, but higher than the P16-P26 period. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is approximately 87.6 units. Given the high standard deviation (approx 62) and the current high inventory levels (On-hand: 254, In-transit: 382, total pipeline: 636 units), we are currently significantly overstocked relative to the 87.6 unit average. The In-transit inventory alone covers more than 4 periods of demand at this new average. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the high-volatility spikes, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent N=8 period average (approx 88 per period, so mu_hat for 1+L=5 is ~440) and using a calculated sigma to account for the confirmed high volatility. No new transition is detected this period beyond the existing high-variance state.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 continues to exhibit high volatility (range [5, 163]) and a mean around 90-100 units. The most recent demand (P35) was 144, following a very low period. This inconsistency is typical of the current 'high-volatility' regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My pipeline inventory is currently high due to recent large orders arriving (P31 order arrived in P35, P32 order of 185 is expected in P36). With 292 units on hand and 200 in transit, I am well-stocked to handle the next lead time cycle even at the higher end of demand. I will use the recent 9 periods (P27 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility, which better reflects the current 'bumpier' demand environment than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P27-P35 confirmed: High mean (~95) and extreme volatility (StdDev ~60, range [5, 163]).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 27-36) is characterized by a mean of approximately 93 units and extremely high volatility (StdDev approx 61). Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost order from Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is high (385 units) due to recent large arrivals (from Period 31 and 32 orders) meeting moderate demand. The pipeline inventory is 109 units (comprising orders from Period 33 and 36), making the total position 494 units. Given the lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for Period 37-41 (L+1 = 5 periods). With a regime mean of ~93, the expected demand over 5 periods is 465. Since the current inventory position (494) already covers this expectation, the OR backend's capped policy should naturally moderate ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this high-volatility, higher-demand regime (P27-P36) for both mean and standard deviation, and stay with 'default' for lead time as 4 periods is the stable observed value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P27-P36 confirmed: Mean ~93, StdDev ~61, range [5, 163].

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting from Period 27 remains characterized by high mean (approx 93 units) and extreme volatility (StdDev approx 60). Recent periods (P32-P37) have shown lower demand (33, 5, 18, 144, 92, 32), with the aggregate mean since P27 slightly cooling but the variance remaining very high. Current on-hand inventory (368) plus in-transit (179) totals 547 units. Given the high volatility and current surplus (ending inventory 368), I will maintain the current regime settings (N=11 for mu_hat to cover P27-P37). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The goal is to allow the on-hand inventory to be utilized while maintaining a safety buffer against the observed sharp demand spikes (up to 163).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 93 units and a high standard deviation (approx 61). On-hand inventory is currently high (268 units), and there are 183 units in-transit. The order from Period 34 (0 units) and Period 35 (0 units) are expected to arrive in the next two periods, but since they were zero, no stock will arrive until the order from Period 36 arrives in Period 40. Given the high on-hand inventory and the lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime starting from Period 27 (N=12) to ensure the OR engine accounts for the high volatility and current mean levels. The lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P39) continues to exhibit high volatility with a range of [5, 163]. The mean demand for this 13-period segment is approximately 84.8 units. Although the previous short-term average was higher (~93-95), the most recent three periods (P37-P39) have shown lower demand (32, 100, 30), bringing the regime average down. Given the high volatility (StdDev ~55) and the 4-period lead time, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=13 to capture this entire high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding the known lost shipment from P18). High inventory (On-hand: 238, In-transit: 283) suggests we should be cautious with orders to avoid overstocking while holding costs accumulate, especially since the service level backend (q) is naturally high (4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P27-P39 confirmed: Mean ~85, StdDev ~55, range [5, 163]. Demand remains highly volatile but the mean has softened slightly compared to the early-regime spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (range [5, 171]) with a persistent regime that began around Period 27. The mean demand for the most recent period (P27-P40) is approximately 88 units with a standard deviation of 57. The current on-hand inventory is 193 units, and the pipeline inventory is 196 units (reflecting orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P36 order arriving in P40. The OR backend needs to account for this high volatility to prevent stockouts during sudden spikes, while managing the risk of overstock given current inventory levels. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the P27-P40 regime) to capture the current mean and high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has been characterized by high volatility (range [5, 163]) and a mean around 90-95 units. Specifically, the last 15 periods (P27-P41) have a mean demand of 88.5 and a standard deviation of 56.6. We are currently in Period 42 with 189 units on hand and 269 units in transit. The in-transit inventory includes orders from P38 (4 units), P39 (100 units), P40 (7 units), and P41 (158 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the high volatility, a conservative approach is necessary to avoid excessive overstock, although we must remain protected against demand spikes up to ~160. Setting N=15 for mu_hat captures this recent high-volatility regime mean (approx 88.5) while including enough samples to stabilize the estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P42) shows a mean of approximately 88 units with a standard deviation of about 52. While the mean has decreased slightly from the early spike of this regime, volatility remains extremely high. The on-hand inventory is 117, and there are 351 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from P39 (100 units), P40 (7 units), P41 (158 units), and P42 (86 units) over the next four periods. The current inventory position (on-hand + pipeline = 468) is sufficient for about 5 periods of average demand (5 * 88 = 440). To maintain the target service level given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the most recent regime's behavior (P27-P42). This ensures parameters reflect the current high-variance environment while providing enough buffer for potential demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P27-P42 confirmed: Mean ~88, StdDev ~52, range [5, 163]. High volatility continues to be the primary challenge for inventory management.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand inventory is 157 with 320 units in-transit. Lead times have been consistent at 4 periods, with the exception of the lost shipment in Period 18. The OR backend needs to account for the high volatility (StdDev ~52) to prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the demand behavior since the Period 27 shift, providing a stable yet responsive estimate of the current regime's mean and variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 remains highly volatile with a mean around 90 units and a high standard deviation (approx 55). At Period 45 start, on-hand inventory is 38. In-transit inventory is 362 units (from Periods 41-44), with the Period 41 order (158 units) expected to arrive during this period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., P44 showed P40's order arriving). Demand patterns in the most recent periods (P27-P44) represent the current 'high-volatility' regime. I will use recent_N with N=18 (the length of the current regime from P27 to P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific behavior while filtering out the extremely low-mean period (P16-P26). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high variance and protects against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime established around Period 27. Recent demand (P41-P45: 89, 76, 60, 126, 72) shows a 5-period average of approximately 84.6 units. The most recent period (P45) demand was 72. On-hand inventory is 124 units with 340 units in-transit. Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods since the start of the game (excluding the confirmed lost shipment from P18). I will use a N=19 window (from Period 27 to 45) to capture the current high-volatility regime's mean and standard deviation, as this period represents the most relevant historical context for the current demand behavior. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the observed variance (~55-60) while reflecting the slightly lower average demand seen over the last few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-120.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized into a high-volatility pattern with a mean around 88 units and a high standard deviation. Recent demand (P44-P46) has shown significant fluctuation (126, 72, 18). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, although a previous order (P18) was lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 192 units and in-transit is 319 units (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the lead time is 4, any order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game's horizon. However, the OR engine needs parameters to maintain the logic for this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the regime since Period 27, ensuring the base stock level (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) reflect the current environment. Since mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean, setting N=20 covers the most relevant high-volatility history.

Daily Profit: $96.00, Daily Holding Cost: $237.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-141.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The demand regime from Period 27 onwards is characterized by high volatility (standard deviation ~50-60) and a mean of approximately 88. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P43-P47) includes [60, 126, 72, 18, 24], showing a notable softening (average 60.0) compared to the longer-term regime mean. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), and generous on-hand (237) plus in-transit (253) inventory, we are significantly overstocked relative to the remaining expected demand. The inventory pipeline (~490 units) is more than sufficient to cover the rest of the game, even if demand spikes to historical maximums. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower average (N=5) to minimize further ordering and mitigate holding costs, while maintaining a standard sigma_hat to account for the known high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has softened over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) to ~60.0, compared to the P27-P42 regime mean of ~88.

Daily Reward (R_t): $674.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which is the primary driver of inventory management challenges. Most recently, Period 48 saw a significant demand spike of 192 units, following several periods of much lower demand (averaging ~60 from P43-P47). This confirms the high-volatility regime identified in previous periods (range 5-192). Since we are at Period 49 out of 50, the lead time of 4 periods means any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the current on-hand inventory (94 units) and the immediate arrivals to meet the final two periods of demand while minimizing holding costs. Given the average demand in this volatile regime is approximately 85-90 units and we have 94 units on hand plus an expected arrival in Period 49 (from P45 order), we are well-positioned. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent high-volatility regime to ensure the OR backend provides a stable target, using a recent_N of 10 to capture both the softening mean and the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: Period 48 saw a spike to 192 units, the highest in the history, confirming the regime's range [5, 192] and making Mean/StdDev projections challenging.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face extreme demand volatility within the current regime (P27-P49). The last two periods (P48, P49) saw the highest demands in the history of the game (192 and 182 units), which has significantly depleted on-hand inventory to 48 units. This follows a period of relatively low demand (P43-P47 mean ~60). The pipeline inventory is healthy at 243 units, including orders from P46, P47, P48, and P49. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the observed actual lead time of 4 periods (P45 arrived in P49), I will continue using L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the extreme spikes in the last two periods make using a long-term average risky; however, specific recent_N captures both the lull and the spikes. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 (covering P40-P49) to capture the recent mean of ~102.3, helping to compute a base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the current high volatility (StdDev ~65), ensuring a high service level to prevent stockouts during future spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P27-P49 continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a new historical peak of 192 units in P48 and 182 units in P49. The range is now [5, 192].
