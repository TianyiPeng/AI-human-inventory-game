The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now will not arrive until the start of Period 6 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message). The historical demand average is 111.4 units (samples: 112, 97, 116, 138, 94). To calculate the base-stock level, we consider a review period + lead time of 1 + 4 = 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 557 units. The profit margin is high ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), resulting in a high critical fractile (0.8), which justifies carrying safety stock. The OR recommendation of 141 units is capped. However, given we start with zero inventory and have a 4-period lead time, we are facing a guaranteed stockout for Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to the lead time gap.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demands were [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] (mean ~111.4). Recent demands in P1 and P2 were 107 and 116, which align closely with the historical mean. No seasonality or regime shifts are evident yet.\n3. Inventory Position: Total pipeline is 278. To cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (so L+1 = 5 periods), we need roughly 5 * 111.4 = 557 units. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 136 units. Following the calculation: Pipeline (278) + Order (136) = 414. This is slightly lower than the 557 units estimated for a full 5-period cover, but the OR model uses a cap to smooth ordering and prevent overstocking of high-holding-cost items (Holding cost is 25% of profit). \n5.

Recent demand in Periods 1-3 was [107, 116, 64], showing a slight dip in the most recent period, bringing the overall average to 106.6. 3.

Pipeline inventory (In-transit) consists of 150 units ordered in Period 32, which are expected to arrive in Period 36 (visible in Period 37's decision phase). Total inventory position is 508 units. Demand Analysis: While a demand regime shift was noted at Period 30 (avg ~133), recent demand has been volatile (33, 5, 18, 144). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 80 units per period. Strategy: A lead time of 4 periods means we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the higher regime average of 133, we need 665 units; using the 10-period average of 80, we need 400 units. Our current inventory position of 508 is sufficient to cover about 4-6 periods of demand depending on the average used. The OR recommendation of 26 units is conservative, likely aiming to maintain a base stock level without over-ordering into a high-holding-cost situation.

Looking at the last two periods (35-36), demand returned to 144 and 92 units respectively. The OR recommendation of 91 units aims to maintain service levels while accounting for current inventory.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been fluctuating with a significant mean of ~90-100 units. P44 demand was 126. Total periods remaining = 6 (P45-P50). \n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 32. In-transit is 363 (P41: 145, P42: 88, P43: 73, P44: 57). \n4. Strategy: We are approaching the end of the game (Period 45 of 50). The total inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 395 units. With 6 periods left and an average demand around 100, we need approximately 600 units to avoid stockouts.

No shipments are currently perceived as lost.\n2. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 175. In-transit inventory is 310 units (P43: 73, P44: 57, P45: 130, P46: 50). Total pipeline + on-hand = 485 units.\n3. Demand Analysis: Since the regime shift noted at P26-P30, demand has been volatile, ranging from 5 to 144. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) is ~74 units, but the last 20 periods (P27-P46) average ~84 units. The OR baseline caps the order at 32, assuming a lower mean or restricted variance.\n4. Strategy: With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At an average demand of ~85 units/period, we need roughly 425 units in the system. Our current total (485) already exceeds this. However, we are approaching the end of the game (Period 47 of 50). Orders placed now (P47) will arrive in P51 (47+4), which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur potential holding costs or fulfill demand in periods that do not exist in this simulation. My goal is to minimize ending inventory at P50 while ensuring no stockouts in P47-P50.\n5. Adjustment: Current on-hand (175) + expected arrivals in P47 (73 from P43), P48 (57 from P44), P49 (130 from P45), and P50 (50 from P46) total 485 units.
