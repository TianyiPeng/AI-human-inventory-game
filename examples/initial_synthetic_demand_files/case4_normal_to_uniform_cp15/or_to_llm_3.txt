The long-term historical average, including the pre-game samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94], is approximately 95 units per period.

Strategy: The OR algorithm recommends 124 units. Considering the frequent stockouts (Periods 8, 10, 21, 26, 28) and the high recent volatility, a slightly more aggressive stance than the capped OR recommendation is warranted to capture potential demand spikes above 124. However, holding costs ($1) vs profit ($4) suggest we shouldn't over-order excessively. Since lead time is 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand.\n4.

The recent Period 48 demand of 192 is the highest recorded, suggesting potential volatility or a peak. However, average recent demand (last 5 periods) is approximately 66, but influenced by the massive outlier.\n4. Strategy: Period 49 is the penultimate period (49/50). Because the lead time is 0, orders placed now satisfy Period 49 demand. Any excess on-hand at the end of Period 49 will incur holding costs and must cover Period 50 demand. \n5. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 126 units based on a safety stock approach. Given the 0-period lead time and the fact that we are nearing the end of the game, avoiding a stockout takes priority over holding costs for one period, but over-ordering for 126 units when average demand is ~80 might leave excessive inventory for the final period. However, following the OR recommendation of 126 is prudent to ensure we capture potentially high demand in Period 49 without excessive risk, as 126 units is close to the 95th percentile of observed demand (~140-160).",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a historical demand mean of approximately 88.5 units with a standard deviation of 41.5 units. Recent demand in Period 48 (192) and Period 49 (182) shows a significant spike over these averages, more than double the historical mean. The OR-calculated base stock level (around 140) and cap (129) are based on the full history, but the last two periods suggest a temporary or new high-demand regime. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Since Period 50 is the final period of the game, I need to ensure sufficient stock to meet this elevated demand without over-ordering excessively for a zero-value ending inventory, though profit ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1). Given the recent two-period burst, I will override the OR cap and aim for an inventory level closer to the recent high demand (around 180-190). On-hand inventory is currently 0.",
