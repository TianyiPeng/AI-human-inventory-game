The pre-game sample mean was higher (~111), but recent evidence suggests a slightly lower average around 95-100 units. 3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand inventory is 63 units, which is quite high compared to previous starting inventories after a low-demand period (P11 demand was 58). 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR algorithm suggests ordering 57 units. Checking the calculation: With a lead time of 0, the target is to cover one period (P12). Using a base stock approach: Mean (~95) + Safety Stock (approx 1.28 * 25 = 32) = 127 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand including initial samples [112, 97, 116, 138, 94] and P1-P19 indicates a mean of approximately 90-95 units. However, recent periods show volatility (P17: 6, P18: 87, P19: 43). The low demand in P17 and P19 suggests a potential temporary regime shift or high variance. 3. Inventory & OR Analysis: Starting inventory for Period 20 is 77 units. The OR recommendation is 42 units, aiming for a total stock of 119 (77 + 42), which aligns with the historical peak demands around 120. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), overstocking is risky. 4. Strategy: Following the OR recommendation of 42 units is prudent.

{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward for the final two periods (49 and 50). Lead time is confirmed as 0, meaning orders arrive within the \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with Period 48 experiencing a high of 192 units. The historical average demand is approximately 85-90 units, but the standard deviation is high. The OR recommendation is 126 units, which is based on the capped base-stock policy. Given that this is the penultimate period, I must ensure enough stock to cover a possible high demand in Period 49 while avoiding extreme overstocking that would incur high holding costs in the final period. Since lead time is 0, any units not sold in Period 49 will carry over to Period 50. I will order 135 units, slightly above the OR recommendation, to buffer against the volatility seen in Period 48 while remaining close to the 95th percentile cap of the model.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Analyzing the recent demand history shows a significant spike: Period 48 (192 units) and Period 49 (182 units) are much higher than the historical mean $(\approx 86)$. This suggests a demand regime shift or a significant seasonal event. The OR recommendation of 129 units is based on the full history and is now undershooting the actual demand trend. With a profit of $4.00 and a holding cost of $1.00, the critical fractile is 0.8, justifying a high service level. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the recent average demand of ~187 over the last two periods, I will override the OR recommendation and order 185 units to align with the new demand regime and minimize lost sales.",

{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following two periods of exceptionally high demand (Period 48: 192, Period 49: 182). The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and can satisfy demand within the same period. The OR algorithm recommends 129 units based on a long-term historical mean of approximately 85-90. However, the last two periods suggest a significant high-demand spike. While these might be outliers, stocking only 129 units carries a high risk of stockout if the demand remains elevated (around 180+). To mitigate stockout risk while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility, I will increase the order quantity to 160. This is higher than the capped OR recommendation but lower than the peak demand of 192, balancing the risk of high holding costs against lost profit ($4 vs $1).",
