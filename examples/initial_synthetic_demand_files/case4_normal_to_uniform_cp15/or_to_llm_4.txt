This means an order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in that same period, but we won't observe the arrival confirmation until the start of Period 4. Consequently, demand for Period 1 and Period 2 will inevitably result in stockouts since there is no existing inventory and the earliest arrival is P3. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 111.4 and a standard deviation of 17.6. The OR recommendation of 141 units is derived from a capped base-stock policy. Following the OR recommendation is prudent here because, while we face initial stockouts, we need to establish a pipeline.

For Period 2, we still have 0 units on-hand, meaning we will stock out again this period. Our objective is to ensure we have enough inventory for Period 3 (when the first order arrives) and Period 4 (when the current order will arrive). Historical demand average is approximately 111 units (112, 97, 116, 138, 94, and 107 from P1). The OR recommendation for Period 2 is 137 units.

The OR's 137 seems conservative given we've missed all sales in P1 and will miss all sales in P2.

Since Period 3 conclude shows 0 arrivals, the L=1 inference might be inconsistent or the Period 2 order is slightly delayed. I will assume L=1 to 2 range. 2. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 273 (Orders from P2 and P3). Demand in P3 was 64, significantly lower than the historical average (~110). We stocked out in P3 (sold 25 of 64 demand). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demands: [112, 97, 116, 138, 94, 107, 116, 64]. The mean is approx 105. P3's demand of 64 is an outlier on the low side. 4. OR Recommendation: 75 units. The OR uses L=2. If L is actually 1, the pipeline (273) is quite high relative to expected demand. However, we are currently at 0 stock. 5. Strategy: The 273 units in transit (P2 order of 137 and P3 order of 136) should arrive in P4 and P5. If P2 arrives now (P4), we have 137 units to meet ~105 demand.

Based on L=1, the Period 2 order was expected in Period 3 and the Period 3 order was expected in Period 4. Neither arrived. This suggests either a shift back to L=2 (or longer) or lost shipments. 2.

Recent demand (P3-P5) has softened slightly (64, 92, 88), but we have been stocking out (sold 0 in P4 and P5) due to supply failure. \n4. **OR Recommendation Reconcile**: The OR agent recommends 0 units because it counts the 348 units in-transit against its base-stock target (calculated with L=2).

Recent demand (P8=137, P7=93, P6=84) shows a slight upward trend compared to the initial history. Total in-transit is 563, but this includes 273 units from P2/P3 which are lost. Active pipeline is 290 units (P6: 110, P7: 50, P8: 130). 3.

While some orders arrived in 1-2 periods (P10, P15), most successful deliveries arrive in 3 periods. 2. Pipeline Inventory Audit: Total In-transit is reported at 683. However, history shows significant loss. Period 2 and 3 orders (273 units) and Period 8 (130 units) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 13 (150 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. These total 553 units. The 'effective' in-transit is 683 - 553 = 130 units (representing the P16 order). 3. Demand & Inventory: Current on-hand inventory is 144 units. Demand dropped sharply to 6 units in Period 17, likely an anomaly or a brief lull. Assuming demand returns to the long-term mean of ~95 units, current stock (144) and effective in-transit (130) provide a total coverage of 274 units. 4. Strategic Calculation: With a 3-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 18, 19, 20, and 21. Total demand (4 * 95) is ~380 units. Current total inventory (274) leaves a deficit of 106 units. The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the 'ghost' units in-transit as real inventory.

The promised lead time is 2. \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Status**: On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 783 units. However, consistent with previous periods' insights, a significant portion of this is lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (137), P3 (136), P8 (130), and P13 (150) are confirmed lost, totaling 553 units. The effective pipeline is therefore 783 - 553 = 230 units (representing orders from P16, P18, P19, etc., though P16 and P18 have already arrived). Looking at recent orders: P19 (100) is 8 periods old (likely lost), P21 (50) arrived, P22 (50) arrived, P23 (100) arrived. No orders were placed in P24, P25, or P26. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has been volatile: 171 (P21), 47 (P22), 12 (P23), 56 (P24), 59 (P25), 132 (P26). The historical mean is roughly 90-100 units. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it views the 783 units in transit as valid inventory. Since the effective pipeline is near zero (most in-transit units are years old and lost) and on-hand is 0, we must order to cover demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods). Assuming a mean demand of 100, we need ~300 units in the system.

Demand is highly variable, averaging approximately 85-90 units per period, but frequently peaking above 130.

Confirmed lost units through Period 42 total 1173 (P2, P3, P8, P13, P16, P19, P30, P31, P32). Additionally, the order from Period 40 (130 units) is now 3 periods old and hasn't arrived; while not yet confirmed lost, it is at the edge of the observed 1-3 period window. The effective pipeline (legitimate arrivals expected) consists of P40 (130 units - potential arrival), P41 (130 units), and P42 (130 units), totaling 390 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 78 units. With an on-hand inventory of 54 units and a target stock level covering L+1 periods (approx 3 * 80 = 240 units), the OR recommendation of 0 is likely triggered by the inflated 1433 in-transit figure. 4. **Decision Logic**: We need to maintain a steady flow because of the high loss rate (roughly 50-70% of orders are lost). If we stop ordering (as OR suggests), we risk a stockout if the older in-transit units are indeed lost. I will place a standard order of 130 units to maintain the buffer, assuming the 1173 units are permanently gone and recognizing that current on-hand only covers one period of average demand.",

Therefore, the effective pipeline is 1303 - 1173 = 130 units (this is the order placed in P42).

Total demand to cover over the lead time (L+1 = 4 periods) is roughly 300 units.\n\n4. **Order Calculation**: \n   - Current On-hand: 128\n   - Expected Arrival this period (P42 order): 130\n   - Expected Arrival next period (P43 order): 130\n   - Total supply through P46: 388 units.\n   - Total expected demand through P46: ~300-350 units.\n\n5. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely miscalculates the pipeline by including the 1173 lost units.
